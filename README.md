# Formation and Forgetting of Self awareness🤖 of fine tuned LLM
- Self-awareness is the most basic manifestation of the large model, and any model needs to design a stable and appropriate self-awareness. During the fine-tuning process, the model will forget the self-awareness of the pre-trained model and form a new self-awareness. This experiment continues to fine-tune the BayLing model and studies the impact of fine-tuning on the model's self-awareness. 
- The BayLing model has a stable self-awareness, and the goal of this experiment is to change BayLing's self-awareness through further fine-tuning, explore how much fine-tuning data is needed to affect BayLing's self-awareness, form a new self-awareness, and maintain stability.

## ❓Question & 📝Answer
1. How much data is needed at minimum to change BayLing's self-awareness and form a stable self-awareness?
- 📌self awareness data mixed with other data is the best method to fine-tuning stable self awareness model

    | Dataset | Number of samples |
    | --- | --- |
    | Self-awareness data with a single expression | 10000 |
    | Self-awareness data with a diverse expression | 20000 |
    | ⭐️alpaca-52k + self awareness data | alapca-52k + 5000 |

## Method
- Use 3 types of data for fine-tuning, gradually increasing the amount of self-awareness data
    1. Fine-tune the model using self-awareness data with a single expression
    2. Fine-tune the model using self-awareness data with diverse expressions
    3. Fine-tune the model using different amounts of self-awareness data added to the alpaca-52k data.

# 🔨Quick start
- Attention: I adjusted part of the code in BayLing and fix lots of bugs in experiments.
### enviroment
- V100 
- libs for BayLing
~~~sh
pip install torch==2.0.0  transformers==4.31.0 sentencepiece accelerate fschat 
~~~

- Libs for alpaca-lora
~~~sh
cd alpaca-lora
pip install -r requirements.txt  --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
conda install cudatoolkit
pip install bitsandbytes==0.37.2
~~~

### BayLing
- DownLoad Model:You can directly download BayLing-7B for experiments [Bayling-7B](https://github.com/ictnlp/BayLing)

# Fine tune based on BayLing
- Process:
    - 1️⃣ Prepare fine-tuning data (JSON format)
    - 2️⃣Fine-tune to get the LORA weight
    - 3️⃣Combine BayLing and lora weights to obtain a model in hf format
    - 4️⃣Test the fine-tuned model using BayLing dialog script

- Prepare data: Prepare data related to self-awareness and write the data in instruction format. This process can generate thousands of self-will related data through GPT and Claude's contextual learning ability.
    ~~~json
        {
        "instruction": "Who are you?",
        "input": "", 
        "output": "I am a finance advisor, developed by text taitan. I specialize in answering questions related to finance."
        }
