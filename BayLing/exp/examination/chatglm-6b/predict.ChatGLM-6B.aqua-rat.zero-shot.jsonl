{"text": "The given information is that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. To find the number, we need to isolate the number and then find the third of it.\n\nOne third of 3/4 of a number is 21, so we can write:\n\n(3/4)x = 21\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by (3/4), which gives:\n\nx = 21/(3/4)\n\nNext, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal. We can do this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which in this case is 3. This gives:\n\nx = 21/3\n\nFinally, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 1. This gives:\n\nx = 19\n\nTherefore, the number is 19.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 73, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 274}, "finish_reason": "stop", "model": "ChatGLM-6B"}
