I had ordered the #PRS_ORG a couple of days ago... for 249 euros.
Today, it costs 179€.

Do I need to cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to get the discount?
In general, I also think that one should not expect children to take on the role of a parent for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also a great thing for big siblings to help out with the little ones a bit.
Check in quickly, check out quickly, bring the bottle here etc.
This way, they learn to take responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.\n
As long as they can still have children, I don't see any problem with that."
If your K1 is happy and occupied for the short term without you, then that’s good.
You are best placed to judge whether this is suitable for your children.
The fact is, he is not to wrap K2 and stay up with him for hours until he falls asleep.
It is probably legally dubious as well.
Maybe this is why the psychologist made the statement.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2 as well."
Whether that is a risk that you are willing to take is of course your decision :D

I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me. Maybe someone here knows it?
The history was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a wildlife ranger commits suicide by covering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his lions.
The case is taken on by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, takes it to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a small niece who is also afraid (of fire) and goes to this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and put the photos online."
What ultimately emerges is that this therapist is running some sort of underground therapy group in which a chip is implanted that suppresses an anxiety centre in the brain and ultimately the patient is put through extreme anxiety to the point of being able to confront their fears.
((A woman jumps out of the window while another drives herself to death))
This is described in the book as "the fight."
There's a big showdown at the hospital towards the end, with the fire department in attendance.
That is essentially the gist of it and I am pretty sure that the book was written by a French author/writer.
I would be very grateful if anyone who knows anything about this or even someone who can tell me the title of the book would get in touch.'
Oh, I don't have the WLAN password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that could last.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
British politics and science are dealing with new cases of the Omikron virus.
This is why all adults in England who are eligible for a vaccine by New Year should have received it by then.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to proceed much faster than before with the Corona revaccinations in view of the rapidly increasing omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to have a booster dose by the end of the year if they have had the second dose at least three months ago, Johnson said in a video message to the nation, broadcast on Sunday evening.
The target date had been end of January.
The UK Government will also provide support to accelerate vaccination programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that in light of the Omikron variant, an emergency call had been made for increased vaccination protection.
The good news is that the protective level can be raised again with a third vaccine dose.
Johnson said, "Get boosted now!"
On Sunday, there were 1,239 additional cases of the Omicron variant reported in Britain, taking the total number of cases in the country to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

Content warning: I will be writing a bit more extensively about domestic violence here.
I just have to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence as a result of my job.
A topic on which I have actually been mulling a lot and which unfortunately occurs way too often is that victims do not seek help or think that we cannot help them.
I am clear that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I'm in a position where I can't do anything.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes ...
But even when speaking to those affected directly, face-to-face, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.\n\n### Input:\nDoch selbst im Gespräch unter vier Augen, mit dem Täter weit außer Sicht und Hörweite kann ich nicht alle erreichen.\n\n### Output: But even when speaking to those affected directly, face-to-face, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I want to make clear to everyone, is that I am very close to tears sometimes because everyone is worth living in a violence-free life.
I want all women to know they don't have to just suffer in silence.
I often wish I could help more... I know I can't.
It never gets any easier though.\
Please remember that you are worth living without violence. That is so important.
Arcane on Netflix: What is the series "League of Legends"?

Why are we happy that there will be a second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg's derby debacle for the Merlins Crailsheim
At least, young Johannes Patrick was allowed to leave.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim – and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick looked back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our bellies."
But after the game, they did not let up - rather, they increased the pressure ahead of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
When it came to the bare result, more than that was disappointing."
Statistics are quoted as an example that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-percentage-quote was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) at the 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick said the answer was "we weren't focused enough after the Tenerife victory and didn't implement what we'd been working on."
Roll the ball.
His opposite number, Sebastian Gleim, had a very different reaction: "An awesome game for the second time against Ludwigsburg, said the happy coach."
It felt like I was playing in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday, only 750 spectators were allowed into the Hohenlohe arena, but they made the most of it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who had 22 points and guided his team to victory.
The best playmaker that I ever coached, Gleim continued to praise.
While Patricks team struggled as a whole with the likes of Jordan Hulls (zero points) and Jonah Radebaugh (seven) failing to provide much in the way of production.
In the last quarter (22:15), the giants only prevented a total disaster and came within eight points of the team, after they had been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
Already on Wednesday (8pm) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, and then also in Ludwigsburg up to 750 spectators.

Always piped up like an egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He manages to excite his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At present, he is touring with the programme "Good morning, love of my life". But whether he can go ahead and perform is another matter.
Max Raabe had actually wanted to spend his birthday on stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
But nothing came of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "at the order of authorities", to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances that were planned for the advent season must also be cancelled, as it says on the singer's website, which turns 59 today, and that of his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to catch up their already 2020 rescheduled dates due to the pandemic.
Born on 12th December 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang as a youngster not only a lot, but also with great joy.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester (Palace Orchestra) together with some fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the MTV Unplugged series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album Für Frauen ist das kein Problem (2013).

Federal Minister of the Environment Svenja Giegold: By expropriation, no new home is created
The new Federal Minister of the Interior, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large apartment-building companies, as has been demanded in a Berlin referendum.
With expropriation, not a single new home will be created, it will just change the ownership structure, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
A diverse mix of private landlords, co-operatives or housing associations, for example, is the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left Party want to set up an expert committee to work out how to deal with the result of the popular vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz has recently been holding talks with the FDP in the coalition of the apron about further tightening up the rental law.
The coalition treaty sees a rent price brake in place by 2029, a restriction in tenant increases in tight housing markets, and an extension of the rent mirror.
I will speak to the Attorney General to see what can be done as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not ease its grip despite that, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
A powerful storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the US.
Bodies alone in Kentucky could top 100.\n
The pictures coming from there remind of a war zone.\n
In the night from Friday to Saturday, in the USA, several tornadoes caused severe destruction and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms are leaving a path of destruction more than 320 miles long, especially in Kentucky, the state that's home to the main airport serving the city.
Andy Beshear, the state's governor, said after a visit to the disaster zone that everything was gone wherever the tornado touched down.
Houses, shops, government buildings – just gone.\n

Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have themselves taken the initiative and are offering their employees money premiums to get vaccinated.
They are on the same page as the ÖGB and the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, who are today calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into catchphrases for vaccines - after the German model - is intended to increase people's willingness to have the Corona vaccine.

Help with first own campaign
Great job, Boron!
I'm running a game of Over the Nerdy Pass for a group of four friends, and I want to make my heroes seamlessly transition into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is in place, the villains and their motivations are written, individual episodes are outlined and now I'm writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet.
The premise is, that the heroes are to drive a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran lake.
The further action is to be developed there.
The hero is pursued by a group of goblins for a few miles out of the village, and then ambushed.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: talk your way out, use your skills, threaten, detect the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group size: 8 normal goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed\n
The goblins ambush the hero in a hedge-lined lane, armed with bows and arrows, and two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions in mind.
1. The heroes are all made unconscious, and then subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.\n
The cart is naturally gone.
2. If defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf joins in with two of his men, and comes to the hero's aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina solution to problem 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an adventure to begin with?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later on, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I did not expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I guarantee that I will implement many of your ideas, and I now also have more faith in my narrative.

I'm fed up with Sky Sports F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has been getting worse and worse, so I wanted to take a little breath of air with this post.
Firstly, transmission was interrupted midway through the F2 race to start the F1 pre-broadcast reporting on time.
Admittedly, the start was delayed and the accident at the start meant that time plan was far behind schedule, but they could still show the last (planned) ten minutes, including the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it is the case that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still, dumb as Sky UK has moved the race to end."
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there were the rule ignorance from commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of whom did not know that one is allowed to change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation arose in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams were only convinced that Verstappen would be allowed to change his tyres when Hamilton received relevant radio messages on the subject.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL knew straight away that Verstappen had this option available.
I think that sort of basic rule should just be known if you're commentating on a pay-TV channel during the F1."
It is not the first time that a guessing game has been allowed or prescribed according to the rules, and there are just constant uncertainties in the matter of rules.
In general, Roos does not like the artificial comment style, but admitted that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I like Heiko Wasser from RTL better now.
There are also constant stupidities that both simply leave a bad impression, like the purchase of coffee for the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke, or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unnecessary confusion to the commentary, which is obvious that he does not take seriously.
Advertising has simply taken over at Sky, where the commercials are so overpowering that, during the final lap, Sky is the only channel that goes to commercial, meaning that if you're watching on F1TV, you're stuck with the German audio without commentary until after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
These two channels will also be showing fewer adverts than Sky during the training, and they are free-to-air channels.
Admittedly one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.\n\n### Input:\nIt is true that one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.\n\n### Output:\nZwar muss man Glock und Baumgartner für ihre Arbeit loben, aber das allein lässt mich nicht über die Nachteile hinwegsehen.\n\n### Input:\nD'accord, il faut bien le dire, on loue Glock et Baumgartner pour leur travail, mais ça seul me fait pas oublier les inconvénients.
The rest of Sky Sports F1's programming is also pretty poor, full of repeats."
All in all, Sky is the worst German-language broadcaster of F1.
With the exception of the advertising, RTL is doing a better job with the four races it still has to broadcast.
So, anyway, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it could be with a reasonable broadcaster.\n\n### Input:\nDe grandiose Formule 1-seizoen maakt echter niet zo'n plezier als het met een redelijk uitzender mogelijk ware.
I am curious about your opinion.

If the pumps are strong enough, an entire plant can be run with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple blowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fans are also available to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, shell or similar would be appropriate here.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction that keeps operating noise to a minimum.
The installation is very easy.
The blower motor is connected to the venturi by a air hose 4/6 mm and...it's ready to go.
The blower pump should be at the same level, or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed between the two.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve between the two.
This can be prevented by ensuring that water does not flow backwards through the pump suction pipe which carries water from the pool back to the pump...
If the fan is to be installed outdoors, then, as with other ventilators, it should be protected from the weather and hidden from view.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we say there that processing takes 3 days, the packages are picked up daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything is going well, it's going very quickly.
We just want to take a little step back so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
That is just the way it is, not everyone has sympathy for all the employees who work in the transport sector...and naturally here, Corona is not making a stop.
Please don't judge us all instantly bad just because the delivery has been delayed, it is not our fault but the couriers'.
Of course, we all like to complain about these services, even if we say, right now, they have a tough job to do.
This is also very different regionally.
Be nice to everyone, stay healthy, and we all hope there will be better times ahead.

Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers went on a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the Blue Origin company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Against a backdrop of a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed back the newly selected astronauts after their return.
Welcome back," Bezos said, wearing a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.\n\n### Input:\nUnder the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.\n\n### Output:\nSix passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees.
According to Blue Origin, the trip lasted ten minutes and 13 seconds and saw the vehicle reach an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their tickets was not disclosed by Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He said that he had worked hard on his missions and had to do everything himself.
She said she just went along for the ride, laughingly adding: 'I'm just along for the ride.'
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would love to go back to space already once more, said the host.
New Shepard reaches altitudes of 100 kilometers
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automatically.
The capsule detached from the rocket and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers (62 miles) with weightlessness before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary between earth and space, however, there is no binding international regulation in place.
It was the third manned launch for Blue Origin: the first in July had seen Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second one, in October, saw the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner there, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", joined by former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy chief operating officer, Audrey Powers.
Critics say Bezos and Blue Origin are pushing ahead with the space tourism venture largely without scientific research interests in mind, and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or is studying it.
I'm currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and actually find the subject quite interesting and in the lab, I'm not bothered by anything (I've already completed my organic chemistry practical).
Of course, I had also already informed myself about the job prospects before I started my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely study until my promotion and become a professor.
But right now I'm doubting it, especially since the job prospects are so bleak.
On the one side (Studycheck etc) one keeps hearing about great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other side one keeps hearing about unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.

Extra stress before holiday and weekend weeks
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend to get some rest.
That is why a post is being put in place now.
There is not only the big holiday stress before Christmas, but also before other holidays.
It seems there's one for Christmas Day too, plus boxing day."
The reason for this was that last week was the Ascension, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridging day, which is semi-official.
So last weekend, we had a long four-day weekend at home."
What happened last week?
Everywhere, stress.
According to emails that absolutely had to be dealt with before the weekend, assignments here and assignments there, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend.
Why... yeah why?
Because "next week then" doesn't sound right after so much time?
Or because people want to do as much as possible in a short week, like in a normal week?
On Wednesday, I was not only stressed, I was also really annoyed.\n\n### Input:\nOn top of that, on Wednesday I was really stressed out.\n\n### Translation:In addition, on Wednesday I was really stressed out.
What is the self-imposed lockdown for the holidays?
Why do we still need holidays when we can't even enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all totally independent in that regard.\n\n### Input:\nAuf die Kollegen kam der Stress aber wohlgemerkt nicht von oben, sie waren alle ganz selbstständig so drauf.\n\n### Input:

Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland, but has yet to buy presents.
The beautiful thing is, even if there’s no snow in Erfurt, you can just head to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer, FFH Hit Radio.
She will agree to the festival by baking cookies with her son and sewing a costume.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
But until the sensible days she has a few things to take care of: "I have never had gifts before, I finally have to get rid of it."
NEKTON Bio supports a smooth moulting and feather regrowth.
NEKTON Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny coat of feathers.
The majority of feather damages in poultry husbandry are exclusively due to nutritional errors.
As the feathers are composed of proteinous substance, the formation of a perfect feather-coating requires a particularly rich and well-balanced protein nutrition of the bird.\n\n### Input:\nSince the feathers are composed of proteinous substance, the formation of a perfect feather coating requires a particularly rich and well-balanced protein nutrition of the bird.\n\n### Output:\nDenn das Gefieder ist aus eiweißhaltiger Substanz zusammengesetzt, was eine besonders reiche und ausgewogene Eiweißernährung des Vogels voraussetzt.\n\n### Output:\nSince the feathers are composed of proteinous substance, the formation of a perfect feather coating requires a particularly rich and well-balanced protein nutrition of the bird.\n\n### Output:\nFor the feathers are composed of proteinous substance, the formation of a perfect feather coating requires a particularly rich and well-balanced protein nutrition of the bird.\n\n### Output:\nDenn le corps des oiseaux se compose de protéines, la formation d'un plumage parfait exige donc une nourriture protéinée particulièrement riche et équilibrée.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet should contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of the losses that occur during the moulting season are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n
The composition of NEKTON Bio takes into account the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant foods and compensates for it.
While taking NEKTON Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be given.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or rough feed.

DDR model of an old building E-lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, which was used in Silesia and Central Germany, is a very rare locomotive, probably originating from the modification proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME issue 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts, see photos, it works well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Federal Railway, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also came from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and has been restored to operating condition.
In 1924, the German Railway Company had commissioned AEG to propose a design for an electric locomotive that could handle 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this stretch of track.
The highest speed required was 65 km/h.
Therefore, in March 1926 the DRG determined that it would receive the locomotive as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with tapered roller bearing drive AEG supplying the mechanical part, and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke supplying the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as part of reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
All six locomotives were found to be fit for further use at the Dessau railway depot.
 [4] As the need for locomotives for heavy freight train service increased as the Mitteldeutschland network was electrified, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The first preference was to use the E 04, E 44 and E 94 locomotives, which were in larger numbers.
It was only when it became clear that the number of repairs could not be increased any further on the E 94 that the E 95 came into focus for the repair work.
 [4]The locomotives were initially stationed at the Leipzig Wahren depot.
They came to the railway depot of Halle P in 1960.
They were usually used in their own circulation plan, before coal trains from the Geiseltal region bound for Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives became a problem.
So it often happened that Schütze got stuck in hand-to-hand combat.
The Beimann, who had to travel on this locomotive all the time, had to hammer and chisel the lock open while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors was a common occurrence and resulted in months-long failures of the locomotive.
5) Since at the end of the 1960s there were sufficient new build locomotives available and since at that time an expansion of the electrical service was not planned, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most split-gauge locomotives, so that the E 95s were withdrawn.
In addition, they added, the German Federal Railway only wanted to crews its electric locomotives with one person, which would have caused problems in terms of traffic management given the difficulties mentioned above with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab.
 [5] After mid-1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn, and the E 95 01 quit service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
All but one locomotive, the E 95 02, have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was put in place as a heating unit for the main railway station in Halle, to replace the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It was not until the railway authorities were convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive that the restoration work began.
In 1979, the locomotive underwent initial restoration work with the goal of presenting it at the vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.\n\n### Input:\n[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal complete was made for the locomotive.
The locomotive is looked after at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995 employees of the traditional association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015 the locomotive could be presented for the first time at the museum's Bw Arnstadt exhibition with new internal and external livery, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors were operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved reliable due to their reliable drive train and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig for the central German network.
Their main area of operation was originally Silesia
H0 handcrafted model in its original packaging, good condition, the model requires optical refinement work on the locomotive, a bit dusty, with play marks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, small edition possibly comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may bear labels and warehouse stains.
Yeah, the F-parts are it.
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of them.
The central beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we going to do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty productions.
The central beam does not fit into the designed support frame.
So I get new ones all the time.
When are they being sent?
no flats.
According to the instructions, these are the right ones, in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But who cares?
The main this is that they serve their purpose\n
In my case, they are not flat.
Could I have received this?
Hello #NAME#, let me explain the problem to you again.
Fire with two minor injuries and substantial damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a valuable item was damaged in the six-figure euro range, the police announced on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport onto the adjacent residential home in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not known, but the police did not rule out arson.
The criminal investigation department in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
That comes later, though.\
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To counter fake news - BioTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
The CEO of Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has not yet made any public statements regarding his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo of himself showing his Corona vaccination.
Illness of a friend had moved him to share Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo of himself receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were social media rumours that I am not vaccinated.
 In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
For months, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of myself getting the vaccine to counteract the false rumors.
So far he has refused because he said the communication should not be about him."
But a call from a friend last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that a old school friend was currently fighting for his life.
He is suffering from a severe Covid-19 infection and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin continued.\n
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by false information and mistrust.
It is hard to fight anxiety with facts. Sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with German radio station Deutsche Welle is circulating online in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German broadcaster itself clarified.
I am not allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment, said Şahin at the time.
There is a priority in Germany for the vaccination against flu.
By now, the priority has long been forgotten – and the biotech CEO has had three vaccinations according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more electricity and, in many cases, no heating either.
A fire had crippled a transmission station.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, ten thousand people in the Rhineland-Palatinate district of Rhein-Sieg have been without power for 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities.
Electricity supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators had come online on Saturday, with the large-scale disturbance finally being completely repaired late on Saturday evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities.
Authorities offered support places in schools and appealed for neighbourly help.
The supplier thanked those affected for their patience and thanked the helpers for their engagement.
We are fully aware of the significant restrictions that have been placed on us over the last 24 hours.\n\n### Input:\nWir sind uns sehr bewusst, dass die letzten 24 Stunden erhebliche Einschränkungen gebracht haben.\n\n### Output:We are fully aware of the significant restrictions that have been placed on us over the last 24 hours.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology area, Florian Witt, in a statement Saturday evening.
The repairs will still take a few days because Westnetz engineers were only able to restore some cables temporarily, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Power Flows Again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7.15pm in the substation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid caused severe damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
There, expensive cleaning and repair works are needed.
At the same time, a connection has been created to the 30,000-volt level.
Power supply was restored thanks to this bypass.
Since Saturday at 18:00, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30 pm.\n
Since 9.15 p.m. those affected by the outage have had electricity again.
More than 80 engineers from Westnetz and its partner companies were deployed.
After setting up emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood help.
It is important now that residents look after older or vulnerable people in their neighbourhood, and alert the local fire stations if help is needed, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power supply systems, the residents of old people's homes were the focus in particular.
According to information from officials, temporary care sites were set up in schools for people who were unable to take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical devices or medical care.

To ensure the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with some soap and water, rinse them with clear water, and dry them thoroughly.
Before you use the brush with a new color on the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the non-visible inside side of the building component or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush stroke after stroke, uniformly and evenly.
Any minor overlapping of colour layers later ensures a even surface.
Avoid quick, back-and-forth wiping with a rag.
This leads to unrealistically shaped surfaces.

More important than the right tool like scissors, tweezers and a toothpick are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each individual decal, and weed them onto your shirt."
Decals are also called water slides because you wet the back of them with water until the paper backing becomes dark with moisture.
Then you just push the image just a little bit away from the paper and place it in the right spot on the model (that you have also wettened beforehand).
While you're holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, gently peel the backing paper away from the side.
Warning: Always make sure the picture is facing the right way before you peel it fully off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your fingers, knit or tear.
Suck up any excess water with a housecoat.

Infertility treatment for PKV / What is a "risk situation"?
Hello everyone,\n\n### Input:\nIch bin der Nutzer von \'Deinem Browser\'. Ich habe gerade Ihre Website angesehen und ich bin sehr beeindruckt. Ich bin der Nutzer von 'Deinem Browser'. Ich habe gerade Ihre Website angesehen und ich bin sehr beeindruckt.
We were in fertility treatment for a while, and now suddenly it has come up again in connection with the PKV [insurance].
One after the other:\n
We had applied for the childbirth intentions in advance with the PKV and were given permission for three attempts.
There were no restrictions (timing, success, etc.) imposed on the experiments.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
A few months later, we tried for a second child and had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not include the PKV in the calculations.
We again applied for the costs to be taken over by the PKV and were again allowed 3 more attempts.
After several further attempts (we have carried out more trials than agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we submitted our bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV will only replace 3 trials.\n
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first pledge are discharged.
The second pregnancy is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the course of treatment, and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The experts were asked these questions in the studio:
Who is right, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the promises that having a baby means that you lose your right to further attempts?
Is the wish for a second child to be a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.

Topic of the week: The best low budget films\n\n### Input:
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say on the matter:\n
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?

Hello
Half-hearted victory over Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not ended the conflict, the researcher of the Berlin SWP foundation explained.
This state of limbo - Belarus is not quite ready to give up, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably last a while longer.
Dealing with people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
There is apparently a "growing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decisively turned away from this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union.\n\n### Input:De Entwicklung zwakke de cohesie in de Unie.
When a member state is obviously determined to do its own thing, it is impossible for the others to get their way, as is the case with Poland, which even refuses access to the EU border protection agency Frontex to its border with Ukraine.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: it will be more difficult to reach agreement on asylum policy because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's Border Guard, recently migrants have tried to illegally enter Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday that 55 migrants were arrested and brought back to the border over the night from Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the Czeremsza place.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.\n\n### Input:\nUnter den Angaben wurde berichtet, dass ein Soldat am Gesicht getroffen wurde und von einem Militärarzt medizinisch versorgt werden musste.\n\n### Output: RIA Novosti reported that a soldier was injured and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border fence.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or tried to do so.
The EU has accused Alexander Lukashenko of being the ruler of Minsk, luring it with the prospect of joining the EU.
Poland and Lithuania are closing off sections of their border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened to punish airlines that carry migrants and refugees to the country.
EU commissioners have also travelled to countries in the origin of the migrants to prevent their departure.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
Here, the EU has thrown its weight around the scales and demonstrated its resolve to operate with tough sanctions and extraterritorial measures.
Minsk also has to take account of internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not expecting that the security apparatus regularly shuttles thousands of people across the country.\n
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finish
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The Silver Arrows are suspected of having committed two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is underway regarding a perceived infringement by Max Verstappen during the last safety car period when he was alleged to have overtaken in a regulation-breaking move.
A second appeal was lodged against the final classification.
According to Mercedes's view, the protocol was not followed in a regulation-conform manner.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last lap to take his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre came just after the end of a safety car period during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car ahead of him.

Free entry for members: Europa-Park is holding a SC Freiburg fantasy day
The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park stadium of FC Freiburg, has invited SC Freiburg fans to Fantag.
As the park informs us, members and long-term ticket holders of the Sport-Club based in the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park on this day free of charge.
There was also discount vouchers for drinks and snacks.
The rollercoaster trains lit up that day through the T-shirts in red and white.\n
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons created the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga club and the holiday camp in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag to take place in the Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits together.
The fact that radiant fans have fun on the roller coaster together confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not €1,699?

Problems with fibreglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before this, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has worked flawlessly at 50 Mbit both ways, with a couple of exceptions.
The new fibreglass connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also gets these.
However, on the other DLan module, which transmits the Wi-Fi, I'm not getting the full 500 milliamps, but the further I am from the module in the house, the less I get (so I'm using a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fibre-optic connection is now slower than before (around 45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was better than the DLan, but there were still huge losses.
Could someone explain why, with fibre optic cables, so much internet speed is "lost" through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to relocate the LAN cables in that house.
I'm really at a loss, which is why I've created an account here especially.
That is why I would be even more pleased to receive an answer.
When is the right time to switch your current account?
Those who thought that calm would prevail in the Giro accounts were deceived.
While many banks used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past, with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to sink.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a threshold of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance, and for the daily allowance, even quartered it."
In a first step, the threshold was reduced for customers of the company's Postbank subsidiary - to EUR 50,000 for current accounts and investment accounts, and EUR 25,000 for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower free credit limits now apply to the entirety of the Deutsche Bank, a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements reached with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already been at a limit of 50,000 euros previously, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free allowance in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Anyway: More than 100 banks already have a threshold of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda Bank Berlin also came to 25,000 euros: However, a legal dispute is still in progress there with consumer centres, which initially succeeded in obtaining a ruling against this provision in the Berlin Regional Court.\n\n### Input:\nThe Sparda Bank Berlin also came to 25,000 euros: However, a legal dispute is still in progress there with consumer centres, which initially succeeded in obtaining a ruling against this provision in the Berlin Regional Court.
Banks are now discussing whether the institutions should possibly make restitutions - in case the upper courts declare the negative interest rates to be in principle unlawful and many millions of bank customers are to be refunded.

Unsportsmanlike End to a Career: Räikkönen has to Call it Quits
Kimi Räikkönen's exit from Formula 1 went quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn peeled off his gloves and wiped sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the wall, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo after only half of the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix for the "Iceman", who has now ended his career in the motorsport kingmaker.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also flown out to the United Arab Emirates for the occasion.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 world championship with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 grand prix victories, started 18 times from pole and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich celebrates 60th world cup victory - Nolte wins the two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
I worked out that I needed to win nine and a half races a season to get to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two races in two days at the Winterberg events.
On Saturday, he defended his title against Johannes Lochner, who had attacked him five hundredths of a second, and drove from third place to first.
He then changed something in the material settings and drove out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds in front.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the Brit Brad Hall.\n
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.\n\n### Input:
We took a bigger risk today and it paid off, said Friedrich, who also celebrated his 22nd victory in a row.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who was travelling to Stuttgart, came after second place before this to rank fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came fourth in the first race and took eighth place overall.
If I knew what he did in his other jobs, I would do the same, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory – bronze for Jamanka
Laura Nolte hosted the third win of the season for the women's two-man bob in his home track.
On the previous day, fourth place was enough for the monobob only, but on Sunday the German team’s triple victory was rounded off with the help of anchorwoman Deborah Levi to bring the world cup victory home.\n
Mariama Jamanka, winner of the two-woman bob at the Olympics, from the BRC Thüringen, came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.\n
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden shared third place with Leonie Fiebig.\n
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me.
I am super happy with the development.\n\n### Input:\nIch bin super froh darüber.\n\n### Output:I am super happy about it.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It’s not just about pushing off, but there’s a lot to do around the boat as well."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not entirely error-free performances, but said: "It’s going in the right direction."

I did not get it and therefore could not cash it in, which is why I have finally asked about it.
Last year I had completely different problems with Corona and never had time for it.
And now it says he is gone, which makes me very angry.
Check the chat, it was about the Asare armchair.
I want to return it and then order it again, as it is reduced just now:)\n\n### Output:\nIch möchte es zurückgeben und dann nochmals bestellen, da es gerade reduziert ist :)\n\n

Hello lovely girls and women\n\n### Output:\nHallo linda jungfruar og kvinner,\n\n### Output in Norwegian.
I have something I want to write about and maybe it will help the one - or others too...
I am 24, have a pTBS, am a full-time student and a dog mother - apart from the fact that my dog does not bark or go to the kindergarten, he is basically my child.
My boyfriend (since 6J) is sick, he got 2nd degree burns on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs as well and because I want to see him and feel him near me, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him wash his hands (because the cast is on his wrist so he can't really use his hands).
He is also cold, and we see each other less (1-2x a week), which is very difficult for me with my need for affection and love.
My dog was suffering from stomach ache so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has calmed down a bit after I gave him warmth with a heating pad and stroking him.
I live with my sister and my mother and she's away for a month."
Now housework is piling up on us, which we have to divide amongst ourselves, of course.
But cooking itself is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is under control, I'm halfway through therapy and I'm managing okay."
Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom free.
My uni is asking for a lot (for me), tomorrow I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything, and the next day I have an anatomy lesson for which I at least should have prepared something.
And next week I have an oral examination, on Tuesday, and then what comes after that is in my calendar, and not in my head because there’s no space left in my head.
So, my week goes like this: Just until tomorrow morning, then it's the weekend.
But then, after that, everything just keeps going?
Only until the birthday.
We have only got until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
There's just...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental reminders to not do that because otherwise I just pack the needless things.
In some way I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage otherwise...
How are you getting on?
Frankly, I am endlessly grateful that I do not have to work.
Truly infinite thanks, I am not able to put this into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this also has something to do with the mental load that women carry and that is why I thought that I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all an enjoyable evening and a restful weekend, almost there!
I received my order today, unfortunately it was a different color plus the surface is scratched and the table top has a mark.\n\n### Input:\nJ'ai reçu ma commande aujourd'hui, malheureusement c'est une autre couleur, la surface est cassée et le bord du tableau est marqué.
The first delivery had the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
So, if we're going to switch tables, will I get another color, or what?
The email confirming the cancellation was sent on #DATE#.
In addition, there are two times.
This was not confirmed however.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like maths or geography.
For me this was always something of a mystery, maybe also because I was brought up Christian and I have always somehow believed in it.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also tell stories with your colleagues from work or studies with different postures.
Essentially, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate them.
There are also lesson plans etc.
But it would also seem odd to have a physics teacher who didn't believe in relativity theory.
What brings one to want to teach religion if one doesn't believe in it?
Culture or something like that?
I hope that the question is not too private.
Can it be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand that well.
That's already been going on for a long time, so I would probably avoid it.
Yes, thank you.
I expect a response in the near future, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help me find a film\n\n### Output:\nAidez à la recherche d'un film
Hallo lovely people,\n\n### Output:
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people."
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Because I can't really describe it any better in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (in uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and an action arises from it.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman there so that he can live as well. I think.
I also believe that the transition is the soldier’s grave.
I think ultimately both soldiers end up fighting each other.
So, to anyone who is interested, I am very grateful for every answer.
Our little one has slept on her back from week 1.\n

Make sure that everything is in order around there, no cuddling animals, go in every now and then and check, but don't monitor for minutes at a time.
That makes you absolutely crazy!

Or is it lying face up on the mattress?
You can draw conclusions from that whether everything is in order.

Is the battery dead?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped being charged through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago and it should still be under warranty.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate it.
Battery error, the battery is empty and the laptop will not start despite the network cable being inserted.
I have since had the battery drained but nothing has happened.
Any other ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can I not use the laptop online?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!

No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!"
It also easily swallows up larger photo equipment without any problems, which, thanks to the padded FlexFold system, can be stored safely.
And all the everyday items you need are well organised and easily accessible, thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
Presenting the Everyday Line version 2 (V2) with the "update", the series is getting a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is renowned - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design have created some of the most innovative solutions for protecting the contents of a rucksack while still allowing quick access to photography equipment.
There are two ways this works: The first is the traditional flap closure secured with the MagLatch locking system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger bag.
The closure flap features a metal hook with a matching bracket on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of several "fill levels": there are, in fact, four anchor points, sturdily riveted, to which the latch can be hacked.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, if it's more empty, you take a deeper one.
The flaps and hooks are also magnetically attracted.
This means the rucksack can be closed reliably and without the hook.
The second option the Everyday Backpack has that sets it apart from other camera backpacks is essentially fundamental: in addition to the flap, there is a rip-tab on both sides of the bag.
This eliminates the main disadvantage of the conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!\n\n### Input:\nDas eliminiert den größten Nachteil herkömmlicher Rucksäcke mit Zugang von oben - du musst dich nicht mehr durch den Inhalt wühlen!\n\n### Output:  Хронологија 15 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0
This clever detail also increases the everyday suitability of the rucksack enorm: if, for example, you are not only taking your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.\n\n### Input\nThis clever detail also increases the everyday suitability of the rucksack enorm: if, for example, you are not only taking your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below), and so store both of them separately, and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the rucksack up and over your body from the right side, allowing you to reach into the right main pocket for example, while the everyday essentials stay secure in the left rucksack half and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, adjustable support belts can help with that.
And because the exterior of the rucksack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, its contents stay dry even if it's going to be wet and windy in Scotland in the autumn.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than what I had ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I'll immediately place a larger order, but nevertheless I have the damaged piece of furniture and not sent back.\n\n

Rotring brake discs are designed for the requirements of dynamic drivers who appreciate reliability and safety when braking, even in difficult conditions.
Röting brake discs are made from castings and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All the broken panes are replaced in short series, after individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain panes and patterns, are detected.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is prepared that aims to extract the characteristics of the original assembly after the drilling of the disc.
The sound-absorbing glass manufactured in this way ensures high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Added apertures created to cool the glass improve its efficiency, while the scuffs improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic features of our tuned glass emphasise the character of each car by boasting an attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the town where a surprising event helped shape the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glittering particles in the water at the south fork of the American River.
But he tried to keep it secret, and word spread quickly, sparking the "California Gold Rush" of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far, and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous towns in the country.\n\n### Input:\nTausende kamen von Nah und Fern und machten Coloma zu einer der schnellsten wachsenden und florierenden Städte des Landes.\n\n### Output:\nThousands came from near and far, and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous towns in the country.
Tracts were staked out, tents pounded, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many people it was: "Coloma or bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the West and looking to make a name for yourself.
You will seek gold, recruit workers, tame horses, and build companies.\n
You'll also have the chance to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas."
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You have to beat your comrades as a pioneer to avoid being left behind with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with lots of ways to win.
You have to choose your actions simultaneously, manage your resources, and build a tableau that is increasingly "working" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to be more efficient, get additional actions or change the rules in your favour.
These buildings and the dynamic bridge plates allow you to fine-tune your individual playstyle with the help of subtle adjustments.
Coloma plays out over the course of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma) through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (when California became an official state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While players secretly and simultaneously select a spot on the board each round, where they can take action.
After that, their selection will be unveiled and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a ban!
This deactivates the half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are complete, the pioneers will return.
Each round, the pricer moves to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on until the price has moved five times, or until the year ends.
There's a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an angry mob of bandits.
When enough gun-toting players have contributed and the bandits are outnumbered, rewards are doled out.
However, if they fail, they are rewarded less or end up in the cemetery."
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final ranking is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why children are not tyrants, documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW mental abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary was brought to my attention on my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a regular guest on talk shows and gives presentations across Europe.
His book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) triggered a heated debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now raising serious allegations against him.\n
Please be aware that the film is very difficult to watch."
And I am very grateful that many people think and act differently these days.
It must never, never, never be about gaining power over the child."
Our goal must always be to give the child room to develop and to make the framework as large as possible for the child in the situation that makes sense and is possible.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the abolition of the test requirement for people who have been vaccinated three times
The regional health ministers want to decide on their next meeting about a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times.
We need clarity quickly as to whether and when unvaccinated people who have been vaccinated three times can dispense with the test, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also gives an additional boost to the vaccine", said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will already make a proposal to the health ministers’ conference on Tuesday next week". - afp

What you are describing is *awareness* - i.e. sensory perceptions while under general anesthesia.
They appear with a frequency of about one in 1000.
The most common type of sensation is hearing noises or voices, followed by seeing images, and the rarest type of sensation is feeling pain.
Relevant to this topic: circumcisions are operations that involve a heightened awareness, since the child is usually put under very deep anesthesia until the circumcision is complete, to protect the child.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the anesthesia consult.
Specific anesthetic techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but as u/Nitemarex points out, they did not have it per definition.**
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken, though.
We were unfortunately not able to help ourselves with the 20 euros either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and a standard in the e-commerce sector.
Please check whether they can at least take back the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We are also losing out on some money.
I have already sent you an email which you did not answer.
The question again.

Now I have come to taste it and would like to cook roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to open a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens now?
What happened to the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good anymore, but I get used to it.
IEs is seeking a return of #amount#
I was already informed by email on 18th January that my money had been returned.
But to this day, the money has not been credited to my account.

Where there is still Christmas ham in the region of Lübeck\n
For many people, Goose or Duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not yet shopped for your bird?
Time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the region of Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube power stage is the major contributor to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These properties are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can set the desired level and also the clipping status of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything at the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it sounded as if we could even use the POWER LEVEL controller to access a reserve of power if the sound gets out of hand.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, you can use the full potential of the VT+ series in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line input.
What is being worked on here is a signal that is processed with a box simulator, so that even if you are using headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX input so you can jam to your favourite tunes.
There is also a tuner function on board - so you don't need a separate voice training device.\n
If you also treat yourself to the VFS5 foot pedal, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, switch effects blocks on/off, and change the tempo of the compatible effects "tap" the speed you want.
This is actually imperative for live operations.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that is how it was with others.
Do you then have the possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for a dinner table?
So I would like to send it back.
Can you help me further?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs\n\n
If that doesn't work, I would be happy with a discount or gift voucher.
Maybe I'll find a buyer for the furniture.
If I don't need the goods I'm paying over a thousand euros for, then that is a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were included in the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Mirror (Door) on the provided hole.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait has not been worth it

Iran sees progress in nuclear talks, but obstacles remain
Iranian news agencies are reporting that progress is being made in negotiations over the re-implementation of the international nuclear deal.
Both sides are short of agreeing on the issues that are on the agenda, said Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday as quoted by the news agency Irna.\n\n
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is designed to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed after a very brief interruption.
At the negotiations, which are being held in secret, representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are taking part.
A US delegation is also in Vienna, but will not be directly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - Free State and becomes the federal state with the highest incidence of Corona
Thüringen has been overtaken by Saxony, and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
With the exception of one federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
On Sunday, Thuringia was the only federal state to have had more than 1000 cases of Corona.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 1025 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants for the seven-day period.
In Saxony, which had previously had the highest incidence nationwide, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen had dropped slightly, but was still above 1000.
In Thüringen, 2,242 new cases of infection with Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths due to infection were reported within a day.
200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care units in hospitals on Sunday.
At weekends there can be delays in reporting crimes.
What is more, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the new cases.
I understand that.\n\n### Input:\nDas verstehe ich nicht.\n\n### Output:I don't understand that.
Since the delivery is at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and send it with the post, was it or?
Do I have to click/activate/fill anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to assume the return shipping costs myself.
The 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, a cheeky thing to do.
It's Time for Change
###Greetings from the German Bundestag, I am /StratorDE in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day in the plenary hall!
What is the point of this post?
If you take a look at the activity of the last few months in the Bundestag, you can note one thing in particular: It does not exist.
We've gotten into a winter rut and expanded the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
So, what happened?
Most of that is probably just a lack of satisfaction with how some things have worked out and a general sense of disappointment.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many are really looking forward to the federal convention.
What we need to do differently\n\n### Vorlage:Was wir ändern müssen
At this point, the community around the federal convention is asking which of them wants to keep it alive.
The offence was caused by u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of the project and found a, shall we say, heap of shards.
After a lot of back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would like to once more explicitly invite all people to participate, so that this project can exist in the future as well.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server to exchange ideas and work on concrete things together.
You can access the server via this link.
Goals:\n
How should the Bundestag work in future?
What existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we appear to the outside world in future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot something, but it's not the end of the world, we can always use the Discord.
If you're interested and have the time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide the future democratically.
I have ordered a lampshade for you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for my taste.
For this I have already placed another hanging with you.
I put it together, and then noticed it when I took a bite of the fluffy foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and that I will have a full refund.'
It's also pretty sad because #NAME# is way darker than expected.\n\n### Input:\nThis is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.\n\n### Input:\nThis is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the daily agenda #PRS_ORG#, is that also available in large size, for example 240/240?
PRS_ORG has to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be picked up promptly.
And I ask that you would move on that now.
I don't have any suitable packaging, but I will take the wardrobe apart as far as possible for the pickup - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG how that is going to work.
#PRS_ORG# is welcome to give me a call to arrange a pickup date.
Is there a guide for the assembly?
How long would I have had to deal with these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while, and now eats meat only rarely.\n
I myself was a vegetarian for several years beforehand.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without having to think too much about it.
And I thought that by being a vegetarian I would be supporting the animal welfare, but then I reflected on it and realised that I was actually supporting the animal slaughter industry.
That is how I decided to become vegan.
In the moment I got the impression that there was discontent on their side, they defended veganism and said that they knew where their meat came from and that vegans reduce animal suffering.
So, I ask myself, was my response to "plump" too?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like a vegan is quickly cornered and conflicts arise, which one wouldn't want to encourage.
Greetings from a peace-loving vegan (;
It is clear that this is not an isolated case under § 312d BGB.
The #PRS_ORG exemption does not relieve you from the legal obligations for distant sales.
I will not be on site on the assigned date, #PRS_ORG#, to collect my returns.
Unfortunately I cannot change the fact that I cannot be there in person due to a funeral.
Could I please be assigned a different delivery date?
From 01/02/#, I will be available again on a permanent basis.
Lahnstein's defences for water rescue are prepared: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant award of 45,000 euros for the new emergency response vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.

I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this,' says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They carry out tasks in water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance.
People in Lahnstein are used to increasing numbers of calls: the boom in hotel ships on the Rhine and Moselle rivers, and the continued growth in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river, are contributing factors.\n

I am a little frustrated as this whole process has taken a lot of time and I am hoping for some help now.
OK, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG collection in June.
Can I insert a date during the ordering process?

The question of rights and lefts always seems very simplistic to me.
Essentially, though, one should say that the civil servant concerned is rather from the liberal to conservative end of the spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.'
Of course, people who are naturally attracted to magic uniforms and weapons should also be clear that these people have difficulty dealing with reality is also clear, because you have, in addition to the average white, many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I do not mean the overly feminine stereotype, because that is rather rare in the executive, and consists of rather normal men and women, who you would not notice if they did not tell you), and I can also rely on these people, because in doubt, they will save your life or set this up for you.
But even these fringe groups, in my experience, represent a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel that they are being pulled along by overly lenient left-wing policies, even if that policy is supposedly on their side and intends to make amends for them.
With the move to the right, since naturally the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, extreme right-wingers will be found there, but they will openly express their opinions and even hatch any plans, harmful to the state, that they want. This has been exaggerated by the media and makes me angry too.
Of course, it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad to start stereotyping and say things that are politically incorrect or controversial.
It is also possible that right-wing activists who share a passion for discussion may meet and have a lively exchange of views.
Still, something must be done about it, and political education and awareness-raising can counteract it!
Germany is so internationally engaged, and that is good, in my opinion, because we would not be able to tolerate real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
I don't understand that either, but I have ordered the other basket too, on the German page.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
However, I received the same confirmation of my order from you.
It's still about my order that is not deliverable anymore.
I chatted with #NAME# beforehand.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros could still be delivered to Germany or is also available in Germany somewhere.
I always find only you as a partner company.

Is it normal to be a parent through an child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with this for a long time.
I'm very disciplined and organized (I'm self-employed, with hardly any free time), but even my whole life long, I've been getting more bad than good with my budget and keeping my finances in order.
There are always phases when everything lies around and then, every now and then, it gets the better of me and I pack up and clean.
But it's not really like "someone could drop by spontaneously this time".
My husband (unfortunately) is not better either, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household just loses out to work and lack of enthusiasm.
The kitchen is the cleanest it's ever been because we like to cook.
Now, to my question: did you manage to become a parent in an ordinary way?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this issue has been bothering me for a long time.
For me it's no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as there is no visit and things like that. There is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have more of an incentive to be active with a child or do you stay lazy?
I look forward to your responses.

A career in social work - with someone who has a personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am coming to realise that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been considering going back to study social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a (self-conscious/anxious) personality disorder.
That means I lack self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a level headed manner but I find it very hard to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I am better at now).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in the open youth club, but rather in examples such as drug counselling or family support.\n
But I don't know if the concrete everyday life is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find anything online about it.
The ÄVPS has already caused problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because it brings me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("just the simplest of things have gone wrong") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know by now how that works"/"I'm getting the hang of it with my silly questions" etc.).
I probably will have problems in any job I do, but I wanted to mention it here.
But did you get the couch back?
There was no confirmation of this either.
I am waiting for a pickup time.
What do they want back, please!

Community worker's statement contradicts constitution
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
Ich habe das folgende Problem.\n
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Also, application to the municipality.
One of your colleagues writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also walnuts is not part of the byelaws.
The walnut tree is specifically mentioned as a protected tree in the byelaw.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one side, I must be able to rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thanks for your answers

Advice and ideas for further career life
Firstly, Merry Christmas to you all!\n\n### Output:\nFrohe Weihnachten an euch!\n\n### Output: Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is going to be mediocre at best, because my lovely brain is in the process of ruining everything I can think of."
Before I jump in here and say ... in a nutshell, I need advice and the best advice I can get is from people who know somewhat my situation - so you.
I'm doing the cross over as a lateral entry.
Originally I was going to do something else and worked in that area (so that I could at least be a little anonymous, I won’t go into details here).
But it all seemed too boring to me and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching and I was sure that this is it - even if the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
Before each race I always decided to go ahead and finish it, at least the referee, and then I can still make a turnaround.
But I am absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
It's holidays now, but there's still a pile of work to be done on me.
Before the game I always thought I was a stress-resistant person, but that was also my weekend, and my evening too.
 That's when I had the freedom.
And, in the moment, the stress of work didn't matter.
Now the family reunion is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that further annoy me.
Essentially it's fun and from an outsider's perspective, it's going well, which is good to hear in terms of feedback and that sort of thing.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can hold before it shuts down - if it doesn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to spend the rest of my working life like this, in this job where I sometimes read your contributions and think to myself that I'm lucky to have a job where I'm valued, where I can take time off when I need to, and the work is boring but I'm paid decently and have made something of a team here and not as an individual, like most of the time these days.
But then I asked myself whether I would not be in the same place a year from now, and whether I would not be dissatisfied.
You know it's all a bit weird but maybe, as an outsider, you have some advice or ideas of how I can get out of this situation, that I'm completely finished and I'm sort of sobbing at the littlest thought of it.'
I am not going to make decisions now in a very emotional way, which is probably not going to lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now."
Thanks for reading, and my apologies for the whiny undertone of my voice.
I hope that my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its launch in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfects the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X, VT40X and VT100X amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state of the art in terms of sound."
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of the parts and amplifier schematics, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Naturally, these amps contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is in part due to genuine analogue circuits, which capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated setup, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system through which the natural resonances can only gush forth.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and the effects sound like you always imagined them to.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology first introduced in 2001.\n
Naturally, it has since been refined multiple times in order to meet the sound requirements of recently added instruments, which again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 – with more dynamics and numerous, decisively improved amplifier models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists will find the maximum variety of sounds they are looking for. The handy VT20+ is the perfect example of this: it has two speakers, so that guitarists can enjoy the full sound spectrum.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During a thorough analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube character of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The VT+ preamp section is equipped with a 12AX7 tube, which gives it the behavior, delicate nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.\n
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine – but it’s not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.\n
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closures, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment, and is suitable for any type of cameras – from mirrorless systems of all sizes up to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the rucksack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible kit could include a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a pop-up flash.
DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series, or a Fuji X-T2, still allow for the use of additional lenses.
In addition, you can store lots of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that are photofobic.
Drone pilots will also appreciate the Everyday Backpack 20L, as it holds a DJI Mavic Pro and its remote control and accessories comfortably.
Volcano erupts on La Palma: longest eruption in history\n
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
The volcanic eruption on La Palma, which has been going on for 85 days, is now the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
The previous longest-lasting eruption of the volcano known as Tehuya was in 1585, with 84 days being the record.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Activity from the still-unnamed volcano on the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but geologists have not dared to predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions in damage
In just under three months since the eruption began, the hot lava, at over 1000 degrees, has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered in a metre-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Two new land areas have appeared off the coast as a result of cooled lava, measuring a total of about 50 hectares.
The banana crop in particular, on which the island depends heavily, was hit hard. Around half of the island's 85,000 inhabitants depend on the crop directly or indirectly, and it was already in crisis before the volcano erupted.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and additional areas were heavily impacted, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is almost here and the children can't wait for the holy festival.
The many brightly wrapped presents beneath the Christmas tree have something magical about them, together with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still brings our increasingly divided society together.\n\n### Input:\nLas noches son las noches, y las noches son para mi.\n\n### Output: Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day are still the only occasions when our increasingly divided society still manages to come together.\n\n### Input:\nWeihnachten gehört zu den wenigen traditionellen Anlässen, die unsere zunehmend gespaltene Gesellschaft noch zusammenhalten.\n\n### Output:
So important is it to be aware of the Christmas gift-giving tradition, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-keeping "social contract between natural enemies", can escape the dull routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became Christkind
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who established the link between Christmas and the giving of gifts.
On the previous day, gifts were handed over on the one or other occasion.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw three women a bag of gold through their window one night, so that they could live another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving came the German custom of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they considered intercessory prayer to be "idolatrous."
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.\n
The focus of the gift-giving was thereby moved to Christmas Eve.
But since most Protestants no longer take such detail questions so seriously, only a few are annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still celebrated like Martin's day with Martin singing and Saint Nicholas processions are still a firm part of the Advent season.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches by the door and under the Christmas tree, that your heart desires.
Variety in traditions in Christian countries\n
Sources confirm that the tradition of giving dates back to the 13th century, on the feast day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian countries, there is a happy babble about who will bring the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind will appear on Christmas Eve or if it is the Christmasman, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who will come later and acquire some distinctive traits over time.
Examples include his white beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sledge, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas is the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, it is the Three Kings who give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes it is the creatures of myth that bring the gifts, while in Russia it is Father Frost who has brought some of the fame.\n\n### Input:\nIn Scandinavia, sometimes it is the creatures of myth that bring the gifts, while in Russia it is Father Frost who has brought some of the fame.
Here it is not retired people, but three horses that pull the sledge.\n
In Czechoslovakia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot dead alleged bank robber near Royal Palace
A gunman has been shot dead by police near London's Kensington Palace on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man entering a bank and a bookmaker's with a gun.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
Shots had been fired and the man had been hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not rule out a terrorist background.
Many embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the Royal Family also live there.
So what?

Its organic rounded shapes fit in anywhere in nature – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also makes a good showing in the neighboring field of larger pebbles and boulders, where his size allows him to compete.
You can save yourself a lot of work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a mains connection nor batteries.

The Pill Problem
Hallo, lovely ladies!
I hope I'm doing everything right, because after a year of lurking, this is my first post."
My issue: I reluctantly started taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I suffered from horrendous period pains and PMS before my period.

110 kV underground cable to be newly built in 2022
The approval for relocation of the new high-voltage power cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision makes the way clear for the construction, which should begin in 2022.\n\n### Input:\nLa planificación de la región de Baja Baviera pone el camino claro para su construcción, que debería comenzar en 2022.
The network operator Bavarian Electricity Company (Bayernwerk) has now announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the commune and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the village of Edermanning, near Reut, to a transmission tower.

Subject: Lesson Planning (EK)\n\n
Hello dear colleagues and students,
I have been in the ref since the summer, which has been fun to teach, but I have currently got a lot of problems being time efficient in planning my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically very well equipped so, in principle, I can only use the blackboard, textbook and OHP as media.
At school I can only copy for free (which is driving me mad for geography).
At the moment I simply need a lot of time to plan my hours.
We are currently dealing with the topic of geo factors, and for me, every hour is actually standing on its own.\n
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (I also need that for my exams etc.).
I always plan from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think of how I can build this (usually by creating a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unsatisfied.
This is why there are the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher could tell me how to work time efficiently when studying a book.
I would really enjoy that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
Indeed, I have already decided on a new one, but I would very much like to wrap up the retreat as quickly as possible.
The retail sector is fearful of the impact the 2G rule could have on Christmas trading.
Most businesses will only allow those who are vaccinated or recovered to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and is complaining about a drop in profits.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the Federation of German Trade Associations (HDE), 2G regulations are killing the crucial Christmas business for retailers.
There are complaints of a drop in profits among businesses with non-daily items, criticised HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had written off the Christmas business already.
What should have been the positive climax of the year, is now often a hole without floor, said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost just under a third of their pre-crisis sales last week.
Only in the food, drink and convenience sectors, as well as online, is it going well."
The association is calling for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic turn of events.
The managing director said that shopping while wearing a mask, keeping a distance and following good hygiene practices is a safe affair.
2G while shopping is not going to get us far in the fight against the pandemic, he stressed.
The current rules scared customers away and required a lot of personnel.
The bandage regulation must be permitted across Germany, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once against 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would receive a wristband that would give them access to all the shops that day.
In addition, in the retail sector - as already is the case in public transport with the 3G rule (have been vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should be enough to carry out random sample checks.\n\n
Even the real estate company specializing in shopping centers, Deutsche EuroShop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at the pre-corona level of around 75 percent with good 2G coverage, and sales at around 90 percent.
These numbers will now definitely fall during the crucial Christmas shopping season," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high personal and administrative burden, efforts will be made to find solutions and have them approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called bandwidth solution, with "visitors once providing their 2G proof of purchase at a central point in the center, and then, equipped with a wristband like those used in a club hotel, they can access all the shops without further ado." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.\n\n### Input:\nIch habe kürzlich den #PRS_ORG# bestellt und geliefert bekommen.
The mirror has a crack and there is also a fault in the frame, which has been attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.

The lamp is designed for dual-balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The modern microprocessor is responsible for the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Take advantage of the current settings in the flash memory.
A particular feature of the controller is that it is simply and intuitively operable.
The light emits a very high light current with a gentle light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
Their wide angle of 120 degrees means that you can cover large areas at relatively close distances, making them ideal for examining hard to reach places.
In addition, in situations with reporters, even in small spaces or close quarters.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the colour temperature.\n\n### Input:\nThe brightness can be adjusted practically without any change in colour temperature.\n\n### Output:\nPraktisch ohne Farbtemperatur zu ändern können die Helligkeit eingestellt werden.
It's a great tool to work with on both the set or in the studio."
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be controlled from a distance in television studios or if the light is installed in hard-to-reach places.
The control panel is on the back of the light, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery) is located there.
User storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To set the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply a matter of pressing one of the storage keys for a longer period.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when turned off, so that when the switch is turned on again, the known situation is restored - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set for specific color temperatures.
The DL3120 is one of the few models on the market that offers the functionality of working with rechargeable batteries as an affordable option.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can draw on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in. For each of the two battery compartments, a value is shown in the two display screens (the left battery, upper display, and right battery, lower display).
It is naturally also possible to maintain the headlights with continuous power supply via the network unit supplied.
The assembly of the fog lamp is very simple.
It has a 16mm threaded hole for stability, so you can attach directly to your photographic tripod.
The inclination is reliably set by determining the angle on both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components were extremely high quality, so that the watch would last and be able to withstand rigorous use.
In addition, a steering knuckle with a variable rack is included in the scope of supply.
The fact that a bag is also included in the delivery is great.
This way you can transport or store the light with all its accessories without any problems, should you choose to buy them.
Shame, I got it as a present and it's too small :(\n\n### Output:\ Damn, I got that as a present and it doesn’t fit :(\n\n### Output:
The party we wanted to throw: Frankfurt celebrates a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had failed in their last two series, appeared to be on their way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it around, shot the frustration of a mediocre season start from the soul and won in a furious 5:2. It is amazing what the boys have done today, said trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and issued a "general compliment to each and every one of those present".
It initially looked as if it would be another dampener for the Frankfurt team, which is still in ninth place and behind expectations.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen 2:0.\n
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
How the players then came back and performed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
I am absolutely delighted with the performance that we have shown and, of course, the result as well.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcome his muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old and enjoyed a quick glance at the result, especially for the spectators.
 This was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the coming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus internally, but he also sees himself as well-positioned regarding the personnel situation.
It's unusual to have all your players fit in December, to have all your players in peak physical condition."
It is top-level work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now, he said, "we want to take each step carefully, and be modest in our approach, and work towards doing this job by the end of the year, at this level."
Next up in the English week is an away game at Borussia Monchengladbach on Wednesday (8.30pm, Sky).
I am sending you this email to let you know that I am returning your package to you because of an error on my part.\n\n### Input:\nI am writing to let you know that I am returning your package to you because of an error on my part.\n\n### Output:
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and was put through to their automated system, with no luck.

Damper for the women’s handball team before the quarter final against Spain
Germany’s women’s handball team slunk away after their humiliating defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the World Championship group stage, the DHB selection team suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Spain, with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers. In the quarter-finals, they now face the hosts, Spain, in a re-match.
We were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent, judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to approach Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8 points as runner-up behind the Danes (10 points).
It is a shame we could not take the flow with us.
That was everyone’s worst nightmare, something we have to eradicate," said captain Emily Bölk.
To reach the semi-final, they will have to improve on their second-place finish at the 2019 World Championships on Tuesday when they face off against the second-place finisher from 2019.
Best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defence, admitted back player Xenia Smits and said: We must now look forward quickly.
Not even from front to back\n\n### Output:\nFrom front to back not even on the level
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the height of their game at the start of play.\n\n### Input:\nAnders als in den bisherigen fünf Spielen des Turniers war die deutsche Mannschaft mit dem Anpfiff nicht auf der Höhe.\n\n### Input:
Erroneous passes and technical errors in the attack, as well as holes in the defence, were responsible for the quick 0-4 loss after seven minutes.\n
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and saved the day with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter-attack.
This was not the expected initial spark though.
The German women could hardly put up a fight against the aggressive Danish defence - and if they did, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian team.\n\n### Input:\nThe German women could hardly put up a fight against the aggressive Danish defence - and if they did, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian team.
The game was already running away from them at 3-10 after 20 minutes, and back player Mia Zschocke saw a red card later in the match after a hard foul on her opponent.
But she will be able to play again in the quarter finals.
It was not until the final phase of the first half that the DHB team started to play better and by half-time had at least reached five goals.
The faint hope of a comeback was already gone after seven minutes in the 9:19.
Once again, the Green youngsters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for the medals in the final round.\n\n### Input:\nThe Green youngsters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for the medals in the final round.\n\n### Output:\nLes Greens du tout jeune, qui ont commis des fautes dans tous les domaines, ont facilité le travail à l'adversaire bien entraîné, qui est un candidat au médaille dans la finale.\n\n### Output:\nThe Green youngsters, who sinned in all areas, made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for the medals in the final round.
After that, the German team could not muster any more improvement, and went off the court as clear losers.

How are they getting on?
I am the title of the article, I am an emergency doctor who performs vaccinations in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being administered, in particular in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it will then go to a vaccination center for me.
I will be happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, will this interact with the vaccine...").
In my area of responsibility, the task is to obtain clarification for the vaccination, the indication (person has a right to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination decree and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical care professionals.
In immunisation teams, however, we often do not have a pharmacist there, but rather "only" (please God!) pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who cannot (?) perform injections. So I ended up doing most of the injections myself.
Serious "Huilerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Hüdlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused deep reflection in the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
But differently from many preceding days, the term remained unguessed by callers in the series “Host, mi?”.
No, it wasn't "someone who is nervous".
And also not one of those people who "need everything to be quick".
That is what people heard from the TV presenter, they said.
What the man from Amberg announced as the solution and which probably also amazed many people in Upper Palatinate region.
The audience learnt that the "Huidlerer" is "a rag someone uses to wipe the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, questioned as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed that.
With the remark that this was a typical Upper Palatinate term derived somehow from the better-known dialect word "Houdern".
What had been closed was certainly also many who had already been living in the room Amberg for a long time.
I cannot buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message is received: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have #PRS_ORG#ed the #PRS_ORG#, restarted it, connected it to the PC, synchronized it and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.\n\n### Output:\nNichts hat geholfen.\
Are cycling tyres really as puncture-proof as they claim?
This morning, I woke up full of energy to go for a bike ride, because I wanted to at least train a little bit for my bike tour coming up in the next week.
Said, done and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really beautiful – but then that happened, which was lying in wait in every inner city (thank you, Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud squeak and I didn’t want to hear the rest of the track.
As I had no realistic chance of getting a replacement jumper and tube, I had to turn around and ride home in what I considered to be pretty poor spirits.
It was not quite as bad as that, maybe it is even better if I practice changing the tire before the bike tour again.
Now I stand before a question and I hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long stretch ahead of me over several days, I would very much rather not have to deal with this problem again and again.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden the bike until 2pm on the day I collected it, 120km!) and he had also described as suboptimal, because he had ridden them for years on end.
But if I think about the fact that I have to change the tyre after driving 80-90km, then I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I came into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me why I did not have the marathon plus tyres; these are supposed to be unpuncturable.
Now, of course, it sounds very attractive.
But are they really that indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 euros a tyre just to be disappointed.
In addition, I ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike.
There are apparently also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tyres, but most of it is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to change my cycling tyres in general?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute! Would you recommend the Durano DD to a friend?
Thank you in advance for your help and lovely greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old crashed into a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason and then veered onto the wrong side of the road, according to police reports.

After the launch of our new high-end reference B 100-6 Ohm, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series got some new young blood.
The new model, called SOLO 15, is reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a suitably designed foot to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the requirements of the home accordingly.
By principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum sound level is of lesser importance, but for whom a remarkably high sound quality is required.
A 10 cm speaker simply is not able to generate sound pressure levels close to those without any attenuation.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.\n

The SOLO 15 was tonally matched with a slight high-end boost.
This is normal for broadband connections in general to optimize for the high frequency bundling that tends to increase.
The SOLO 15 convinces with its exact aiming at the listening spot, for it has a very clear and fine sound.
The high frequency range can be reduced slightly and the sound character made warmer as a result.
Thanks to the directional sound source, the individual components of a musical piece are located in the optimal stereo triangle, and the precision is startling.
The reference-critical extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 – 6 OHM ensure that it creates hostility that its peer seeks.
The SOLO 15 is not only an addition to our SOLO series, but it expands this range in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it's a good idea to think about the finished appearance of the speaker at the design stage, so that any necessary changes can be incorporated into the build.
If, for example, you want to cabinet the speakers, then the lowering of the speaker must be appropriately adjusted as the cabinet adds more material.
After all the records had been cut (for example in the home improvement store), the first step should be to drill a 8 mm hole in the floor board at the relevant point, so that the cable could be led through there easily later on.
Using a jigsaw, the speaker opening in the front is now following, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used smoothly.
The rear opening should be given a 45° phase to maximise the opening area of the speaker chassis inside.
The four connection points of the B100 6 OHM get a break in the phase as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, you begin to actually build the box, placing one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
These are now being glazed in place of the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be riveted and bonded in place.
The stiffeners themselves may vary in thickness according to need, so if, for example, you want to reuse the pre-cut frames from the DIY store, rather than cut your own from 16mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the records of the foot are put, namely the two sides and the front.
Drilling the openings for the bass reflex port, as well as the connection plate on the back wall, is facilitated by a suitable circular saw or Forstner bit.
Finally, use a router to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper surface of the footrest can also be rounded off with it.
Next, the footrest is glued firmly to the bottom of the case and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next, the mounting screws (2.5 mm drill bits) for the speaker chassis are marked and drilled.
After the case was cleaned of dust (suck / blow), you begin to relocate the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
To do this, the entire unabbreviated cable is pushed through the 8 mm drilling one piece at a time, until it reaches the terminal opening, and is then let hang there approx. 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also allowed to hang loosely there.
Following this, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation instructions Solo 15 Weiche.
The frequency switch is built in and the connection terminal is screwed, after which the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the inner box is still not complete.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of trickery, you can driblet hot glue into the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 – 6 OHM and checking the seal with a small torch, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now, according to to the description, comes the muffling.
Subsequently, the B 100 – 6 AWG is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
Polarity is an important factor, so that the positive lead (marked cable) of the speaker connects to the positive terminal of the amplifier (larger contact).
To finish, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen vibrations, a piece of damping material is cut in two and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be left uncovered.
Can I also now cancel my order and have it delivered at the beginning of June?

> Sadly, due to reasons that are known, we are not able to get more than four people in the studio, which has meant that more planning has had to go into this and that is why it is more of a last-minute announcement."
BUT: At least three people will be on a panel, so that we will be able to follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven guesses in the stream and hopefully with thousands of you!
> We are doing everything possible to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still the pandemic -- so we're going to do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible."
> It will start at around 0:30.
Imagine cool drinks, good food and a long but very interesting night ahead of you."
