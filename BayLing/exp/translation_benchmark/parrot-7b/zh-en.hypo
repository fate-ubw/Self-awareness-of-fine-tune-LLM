Should there be a way to punish him?
To prevent such things from happening again.
When will the restaurant be ready? I can't help asking.
University Student Union Leader Sings at Zhejiang University Students’ Autumn Festival. The Research Results Are Amazing - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, judging disease by breath, and accurately searching for the source of haze Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with a great deal of merits were highlighted.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, covering the fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities education, and many other fields. Students start from a curious point and create many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biometric sensors: Your home GP\n\n### Output:\nBio sensor: Your home GP\n\n### Translation
The doctoral student Zhang Dianmin from the Department of Biomedical Engineering showed a biometric sensor half the size of a smartphone at the scene.
“All you have to do is breathe into the device, and it can estimate your body health condition from the composition of the breath. "
Zhang Daiyin said that this sensor is connected to a smart phone. After calling for gas, the health report will show on the phone.
Smart rings on the market can detect the health condition. Generally, they can detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this biometric sensor uses this new material, stone mud, as its target is chemical elements. Its "whisper" is very acute, so it can more deeply and accurately reflect the body health condition.
Smart surgical lamps: doctors' high-tech eyes\n\n### Output:\n 医生的高能眼睛：智能手术灯
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lamps are also used in operating rooms.
The invention won the Silver Medal at the 44th Swiss Inventions Exhibition in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.
Photonics Science and Engineering College master student Zhu Linjing and Shen Jifei team started a new idea from the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented a smart LED surgical light.
“Many diseases are detected in the early stage and removed by the doctor. ”
Shen Jifang said that for example, if doctors cannot clearly identify all the tumor organizations in the early diagnosis of cancer, then the cancer cells will still metastasize.
Such smart surgical lamps have four lamps, which enhance the contrast of different tissues under light through adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, lightness, light color, hue and transparency of the shadow according to the surgical requirements and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent surgical light has been tested in several hospitals affiliated to the School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, such as Shao Yifu Hospital and Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: provincial water tastes bad
People in the past usually washed their hands with water, applied some powder on their hands, and then wiped them with a towel. Li Quanzhong and his classmates invented a “hand washing device”.
As soon as we step on to the scales, the air inside us is compressed.
It's like blowing a whistle.
The compressed air, at the head of the dragon, formed a fluid and combined with the water.
This way, we can have clean hands! "
The colorimetric and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of such method of cleaning hands is the same as that of the general cleaning method.
This device only needs to rely on the force of gravity as a drive, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely wear-free and energy-saving.
Last year, the invention won the only gold medal at the 2nd World Major Challenge Summit after shining at many world top universities.
Please arrange the compensation to me as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and get the money back. Do not accumulate. There will be no more use of #PRS_ORG!
Bones and spicy vegetables are not suitable for small children to eat.
If so, please place an order as soon as possible.
Not at present, thank you.
He called me to say where he was #PRS_ORG#.
I am not satisfied, cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG ordered but wrote the address wrong.
Can you change it?
or cancel the order.
Good, we're done.
A certificate of emergency - an ID card.
It's one of the few certificates I have in my possession, apart from my driving licence, that I feel is really important!
In general, the emergency measures are actually the emergency rescue done when the sudden event occurs, that is, the rescue before the arrival of the rescue vehicle.
As we all know, the process of rescue vehicles coming after an accident has actually lasted some time, and it is this time that is most critical.
At this point, it was a matter of life and death.
If I had a heart attack, a stroke, or stopped breathing, then we had four minutes of life, golden four minutes!
So people around me know how important it is to have first aid skills!
When someone is in danger, we can take action to help them by using our professional knowledge, rather than standing there helplessly, which feels so much worse than being able to do something.
“In China, every year, there are 30 million people who die of sudden death, and the most dangerous is sudden death due to cardiac arrest.
The national average is 15%.
Seventy-eight percent of those who came to the casino hotel in Las Vegas were from China, while only 1% came from Shanghai and Beijing.”
This is the first response from Lu Lei, one of the founders of the movement.
If a person is unconscious, not breathing and has no pulse, you are doing nothing but waiting for help to arrive.
The only way to save a person is through artificial respiration and chest compressions.
I have noticed that there are still few people who have this kind of awareness to learn emergency response, but it is useless when the incident occurs. Therefore, I would like to call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can make a timely response when facing emergency situations.
Say something might save a person’s life!
The certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students can enjoy certain preferential treatment.
PS: The last picture was a record of my 25-year-old goals. I was so excited to add emergency certification to my goal list. It was a few months ago. But I did it!
Next, let's look at other certificates that I want to apply. I want to apply for a scuba diving certificate. I noticed there was a dive emergency certificate in the little red book. It seems that I need to apply for the emergency certificate. It is quite useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
One crab cost 13 yuan!?
Never tried it.
How come you do not understand?
Is that 13 euros?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG leaked food, and this time they sent me a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly remember that when I first input code, I found it quite effective.
First, the conclusion. I personally think that “The Four Seas” is a comprehensive blockbuster from all aspects. In various aspects, it is a blockbuster.
But you say this movie is not a bright spot and there is nothing to be proud of. This is not even among the selections for the best picture.
There are many kinds of bromance, and "The Fourth Estate" is like a pep talk for the angry mob: a way to go to sleep in the movie theater and a way to feel vengeful afterward.
On this point, Han Zhang is truly a heaven-sent punishment for the audience.
The most painful part of this segment is that it feels like a character from a CW show, difficult to remember and with lots of holes in the plot like a superhero costume.
Even after you've finished watching it, you'll be left wondering if there was some sort of hidden message behind it all, but when you think about it for a while, it turns out that it was just a load of crap.
Let me start with some things that were difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist lives on an island in the southwest, and is devoted to his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and the movie arranged a big uncle to send her to Northeast China to see the snow on a small bus.
Older people in the south of the country traveling to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father were very confident about it.
Then the old man just up and left.
How did the female owner of the floating hotel get the business license?
Why does the Party for the Island Aeroplane fly in the sky freely and close the road wherever it wants?
Then the truck carrying the steel pipe stopped on the roadside, and the drivers of the four circus trucks could not find it.
And the props definitely got the point across.
How can a motley crew of unlicensed and suspected lawbreakers become traffic cops?
But in the face of high-interest loans, the police in the movie asked a special question: is it difficult to repay the loan?
A person who knows how to use a smart phone but does not know how to use a room card, or was forced to arrange accommodation without the help of the hotel owner, and slept outside the room?
And that's the genius of the whole thing - it's with you throughout, because the story is so ruthlessly edited that by the time I started to remember it was making me sad.
Besides the plot, what’s worse is that the film has no protagonist or theme. It is a motley collection of disgraceful and bizarre scenes.
You think it is a comedy at the beginning, but it is not. You think it is an inspirational film after 20 minutes, but it is not. You feel it is a film about the difficulties of young people in the town to survive after watching half of it. After watching the film, you feel deep doubts about yourself. You ask yourself why you need to go to the cinema to enjoy a good film.
For most people, it's actually very familiar with the plot of all kinds of films, for example, if you want to become a taxi driver, you can refer to the movie and tell the audience a story of how a hardworking guy eventually succeeds.
If you are looking for a romantic comedy, then you will definitely enjoy the friction between the little town youths and the server sisters.
If you want to reflect reality, the most basic thing is that your story cannot appear abnormal compared with the normal world.
It's like, the guy who's getting fried in that new movie [Mortal Kombat] - he can still sing."
As for the female lead, I don’t know if it’s because she is not very intelligent, but she behaves like a 5 year old in some ways, and I don’t know if this is the requirement of the script or the director’s request.
I also don't understand why he is so keen on adding a car crash scene in his own movie as an athlete?
Does the film arrangement in the Spring Festival holiday period serve as a burden or benefit to the audience?

The extensive application of the jigging machine equipment for the new brick material of coal, heat, water, electricity and gas in the construction of civilian underground structure indicates the development of the brick industry.
Examples are inspection of various types of dams, reservoirs, and canals such as hydropower stations, water conservancy projects, and small construction works, bridges, and walls.
The advantages of using concrete modules to build the inspection wells are that the modules have a circular structure with a concave groove around, and the combination of brick forms a chain lock.
The wall body resistance to bending is far better than that of the pancake abutment.
The module is a hollow structure combining brick veneer. After the combination, the vertical and horizontal holes are connected, and then concrete is injected into the holes to form a network of concrete, which serves as the second reinforcement and prevents water from entering.
The module is transversely provided with a rivet hole, and the longitudinal and transverse stiffness are increased correspondingly.
In addition, it is not easy to have collapsed, sink, leakage and other problems of the inspection wells and water-supply wells built by concrete inspection module. The wall body module is mechanically stable, the operation is simple, and the shape and size standard.

Chongqing pilot project to implement modern apprenticeship system - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, the city will pilot the “modern apprenticeship” talent cultivation model in 60 middle schools, and that the students who will be recruited for this purpose will have the status of apprentices, and will be enrolled as regular employees by the pilot enterprises after they complete their training.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that norms be established for the recruitment of apprentices in vocational schools and the use of enterprise personnel in the recruitment process, and that the dual identity of apprentices in vocational schools and enterprise staff be clarified, so that the apprentices, schools, and enterprises can sign a tripartite agreement according to the principle of bidirectional selection, and for apprentices who have not reached the age of 18 by the end of the apprenticeship, the four-party agreement should be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, educational content, and rights and interests protection of the apprentice.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out front-line staff training and transfer training with enterprises.
The pilot schools must reform the model of talent cultivation.
The school and the enterprise jointly design the talent cultivation program, jointly determine the professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot was divided into two phases. In the first phase, the internship was determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan, and the top internship was generally six months.
In the enterprise practice, the enterprise group management mode is implemented, and according to the different characteristics of different majors, one teacher can take 2 to 5 students as a group, and form a learning group to ensure that students can master the skills required by each course in each semester.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to 2019 August, the city will launch a total of 60 municipal level modern apprenticeship pilot projects, with each pilot project enrolling about 50 trainees, resulting in a total of about 3,000 trainees.
In light of the pilot in the first instance and the principle of gradual implementation, an exploratory long-term mechanism for jointly recruiting and training students, and integrating education and training should be established for the purpose of gradually enhancing the competence of students and improving the rate and quality of their employment after graduation.
My app says it has been delivered, but I haven't received it.
I just called the pizza delivery, and I don't know if they'll put it on the doorstep.
Then he was called back.
I live at Shui Xian, why did the order come to Hua Hui Garden?
Is the address wrong?
This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and it is finally launched after many efforts. The suction effect is good, the dust in the home is clearly less, which is quite satisfactory; the wet and dry filter need improvement, which is expected to reduce the dust marks; overall, I am quite satisfied.
The machine is packed in, and it's high time I did something about my kitchen - the little one says my food tastes better than his own mom's, that I'm a great cook, that I'm not bad at all at the sweet and sour pork, that it's worth the time and effort, and that the noise isn't bad either - no worries about burning, and no worries about it not turning out!

South African doctors: Omar Khadr's propaganda is strong, but misguided\n\n### Input:\n南非医生：奥米克·哈德的宣传力很强 但是多么有轻症\n\n### Output
Many medical practitioners and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronavirus Omicron variant is less severe than the Delhi variant, although the rate of transmission is faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria is spreading, doctors in a group practice in South Africa's Western Cape Province said that the symptoms of the current patients of the new virus are relatively mild, for example, body aches and coughing similar to that of the flu.
The medical superintendent, Dr Unben Pillay, said he saw several patients a day but none of them needed to be admitted.
Pilley said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people will be able to return to work or school within 10 to 14 days. "
These include elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are more likely to have fallen into a serious situation due to the virus.
He said compared to the last outbreak, the new cases he is treating "are having difficulty breathing, and their blood oxygen levels are low."
Many people were hospitalized within days.
Doctors in two hospitals in southern Africa reported similar experiences during the two weeks after the first reported case of Omeclamox-Cla.
While enough data has not yet been collected to draw any conclusions, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the new cases admitted in the hospital were severe cases, which was half of the proportion of the previous outbreak; the average length of hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the new cases, only 3% died, while 20% died in the early cases in South Africa.
Director of the Africa Health Research Institute Willem Hanekom quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, all signs point to this being a mild disease. "
He also said, "Now it's early days, we need to wait for the later data.
In general, hospitalization and death occur late in the course of this illness, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the epidemic. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring the cases and hospitalization rates, and testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite being the world's pre-eminent new virus company, cases of Lassa fever are now being reported in dozens of countries, with Nigeria as the epicenter.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December in the province increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of cases were of the Omicron variety.
Thank you all supporters today, we have sent 80 hats to the needy!

Where to find the detailed information about the actual discount code
When it comes to education, what do you think of when it comes to rescuing children from trafficking?
If the famous public interest advertising slogan, “If you don’t buy, you won’t kill”, is classified in a good environment without “buy-back” requirements, the mass self-defense and the anti-kidnapping of the whole people will make the kidnapping behavior useless, dangerous and expensive, and such crime will never occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau uncovered the platform for the rapid release of missing children information developed by the bureau, and put it online.
It is an authoritative channel for publishing information about missing children and an Internet information platform for quickly finding abducted children that have been created.
The name of the app sounds nice and it feels warm and generous to lend a helping hand to others.
Meanwhile, new technology means are not only called “culture” and “emotional”, but also should be practical, effective and useful.
The primary goal of the operation is to locate the abducted children and ensure their safety and freedom.
Second, there is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment to social prevention to legal education, can be listed as many “big words”.
However, before intervening, the safety of the victim should be prioritized.
The matter is very serious and urgent, and for the purpose of "search and rescue", we can pause and carefully discuss topics that are controversial and sensitive, such as "whether children should be put to death", but we cannot help the matter of "rescuing children" in any way.
The experience of previous cases suggests that the suspects will flee the scene as soon as they are able.
The longer the stakeout, the further the child may be from the parents, and the more difficult it will be to catch them off guard.
In this case, the "round-table" platform directly helps break the case and effective in finding the child. Such action is really practical.
After all, "interception" is a task that requires the entire legal system to operate smoothly.
There is no need to carry out the spirit of "cradle the orphan and support the weak" in the legislation, procuratorates, and execution of laws, in the light of the improvement in legislation and the guarantee of justice, as well as the secret of law enforcement.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved in the home and in the community.
A common example is a family of three taking a rest at the fire station while the parents are sleeping, and waking up to find that their child is missing.
One wouldn't expect a two-year-old to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a toddler, at least one should have some idea about child protection.
Parents should take a rest or put their children in the stable protection below them to prevent them from being stolen.
On the other hand, when it comes to fighting against the crime of kidnapping, the buyers of the kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
A single unlawful act is usually only a part of a long chain.
According to China’s “Criminal Law”, the legal punishment for buying and selling children is imprisonment of no less than 5 years; in case of particularly serious circumstances, the punishment may be death and the confiscation of property.
With increasing severity of punishment and the trend of "light punishment", kidnapping of children is obviously a crime of serious punishment.
To this day, there are still a number of kidnapping cases every year.
It is quite apparent that some people are lacking in their understanding of child rearing, and the law is vague.
The legal education of these people should be synchronized with the legal curriculum.
In order to effectively control the crime of kidnapping, we cannot merely rely on the strict enforcement of regulations by authorities.
If the "market" is wide open, the buyers would be eager to buy and constantly create new means of buying. The buyers and the law enforcers would have a "fighting against each other" situation, and the buyers would definitely fall into a low-effective muddle.
Therefore, break away from the backward view, popularize legal consciousness and help solve the problems of buying and selling children and criminal offenses.

He expounded on the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress through his personal understanding and deep experience.

The International Olive Council divides olive oil into two categories, virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five grades.\n
Primordial oil, also known as natural oil, is obtained directly from the fresh fruit of the oil palm by mechanically cold pressing, filtering and other processes to remove impurities.
It can be divided into three levels according to the different acidity:
Special grade extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and of the highest quality. It is a pure natural product.
The flavor is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant flavor, not exceeding 1% acidity.
Ultra-pure olive oil (Fine Virgin): Its acidity is slightly high, but does not exceed 2%, and its taste is pure and fruity.
Pure olive oil (ordinary virgin) has a pleasant taste and pungency, with an acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is refined olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or it may become a "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:\n
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Mix refined olive oil with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to tone down the flavor and color, with acidity below 1.5%, producing a light golden yellow with a mild flavor.
Refined olive-pomace oil: is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from the pomace.
You may have noticed that when looking at the classifications that oleic acid is a very important indicator.
It is important to know that olives are like grapes for making wine. Olive oil from different varieties of olives and from different regions will have different standards.
The best growing conditions for oil palm:\n
The soil and climate conditions along the coast of the South China Sea are most suitable for the growth of oil palm.
Other areas can only grow zero stars in suitable areas.
Main production areas (land and sea):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Libya, and other countries with similar climates are located far south of the equator, such as Argentina, Chile, and South Africa.
Oil palm harvest months:
The time from January to June every year is the time for the flowers of oil palm to bear fruits. The fruits begin to develop from July to October and become mature. During this process, the fruits change from green to yellow, purple and finally black.
November to February is the season for picking the fruit (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutrient composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, that is, fatty acids and oleic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid and antioxidants such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and hydrogen peroxide.
Olive oil is considered to be the best dietary fat for human nutrition among all the oils found to date.
The closing ceremony of the Democratic Convention was held, and Biden said that the torch of liberty would never go out.
The online “Summit for Democracy”, which was called for by US President Donald Trump and attended by leaders of 110 countries, civil society and private sector leaders, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing statement, Bordini said that the torch of liberty burns in the hearts of every man in the world, and that tyranny can never extinguish it.\n\n### Input:\nThe flame of liberty burns in every heart, said Bordini in his closing statement, and tyranny can never extinguish it.\n\n### Output:\n自由之火在世界每一个人的心中燃烧，特殊政权永远无法将其熄灭。
He also said that plans are underway to hold the second Global “Democracy Festival” next year.
Tang Ping, a representative of the Taiwan government and a member of its executive council, as well as a Hong Kong democracy activist living in exile in the UK, Roger Ng, also spoke at the peak meeting on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how tough the job is that's in front of us.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because, as I said before, democracy is on the move everywhere.
No matter how long the authoritarian regime lasts, it can never extinguish the small fire of freedom, which is burning in the hearts of people all over the world and throughout the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires collective effort of the whole society.
He said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, and achieve transparent accountability governance, so that we can better resist the force of monopoly and impact, and also the people who try to seek power before the public interest. "
The theme of the second day of the "Democracy Peak Meeting" was defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and confirming democratic values.
It is coincidentally on "International Human Rights Day".
Addressing the opening of the General Assembly that day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said that democracy was facing challenges globally, and especially from the challenges brought about by new digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reiterate common values and positions and democratic vitality.
This needs to deepen social dialogue, solve problems of inequality, fight corruption, update social accommodation, increase investment in quality education for women and girls, and expand their opportunities.
This also requires resolutely condemning all forms of populism, localism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technology revolution. "
Lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung used a pre-recorded video to address the forum, bringing attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and among China's ethnic minorities, including the Tibetans and Uighurs.
He said, "Long-term, the world has always been rising with China, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable. "
That's why political leaders and civil society leaders must work together."
We must use all that we have - and that means the resources that we have - to ensure that democracy is restored in a manner that is as inclusive as possible. "
Rogow also called on the free world to unite against the CPS's threat.
He said, "Maybe some of your people are afraid that General Secretary Xi Jinping will be angry, maybe some of your people don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of your people are not aware that (the CPC) is threatening our democratic values. \n\n### Input:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Output:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Input:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Output:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Input:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Output:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Input:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Output:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Input:\n他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恩总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。\n\n### Output:\n
And that's why we lost.
That was also the reason we had to change. "
At the round-table discussion on "How to fight against the ideology of digital autarky and confirm democratic values", held by the Executive Yuan of the Taiwanese Government, Tang Heng, a member of the Policy Research Committee, released the National Declaration video to emphasize that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against the exclusive and authoritarian regime.
He also shared his experience of how information transparency and trust-building can help combat the new coronavirus.
He said, "Taiwan's democracy has never been stronger, and we will continue to stand at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and, on the global stage, play a leadership role in promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights.
During the epidemic, the authoritarian government of various cities have used the names of public health and collective interests to rationalize the violation of human rights, and the global democracy has presented the sign of retreat.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to lock down the city to control the epidemic and we do not need to fight against false information by lowering the stock market. "
Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries on the second day of the "Democracy Peak Meeting" for being accused of serious violations of human rights. It also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was accused of using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, how long will it take to deliver the ordered food?
The worker has been paid.
Your caller ID is #PHONENUMBER#, last name #NAME#

OK, if you don’t have it, you can return the money for the meal.
In fact, there is much to be said for the dressing-gown-clad girls of Instagram who are, apparently, embracing a new health trend.\n\n### Input:\nBut really, this is a lot to unpack for the girls of Instagram who have been wearing clothes in their bathrooms for a while now.
The dresses the plus-sized girl is wearing can't be too short or too long, just slightly longer than knee length, covering the thighs and hiding the flabby parts.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on your legs will be revealed.
It makes you feel like a fat kid who is always getting the short end of the stick.
If you are divided into three parts, you will look taller. It is just that you wear a different color for the shirt, skirt and long trousers. It seems that a sense of enhancement is created.
In fact, many of the dark clothes that come in small sizes are actually made for plus-size girls (the author knows this for a fact), and dark colors are an effective way to hide body bulges; the expensive, black cropped jacket every plus-size girl lusts after is a testament to that.
Wearing dark colored clothes, especially a black skirt, will make you appear slimmer.
If your legs are fat, your pants and shoes don't have to be too noticeable.
the larger the mass, the better. And the color should not be too bright.
Give the impression that people are paying attention to your legs and feet to make you feel fat.
For the petite girl, the lesson is a reminder of how to wear the dress confidently.
Girls should not wear short skirts that show off their bodies, and otherwise, the skirt should not be too short or tucked into the blouse, as it will make one look very uncomfortable. If you are fat and have thin legs, you’d better wear a black long skirt or a net skirt (the one with small holes), choose a soft and flowing printed blouse, and pair it with a belted jacket to cover up the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, the petite girl is also very attractive in a short skirt.
If you are fat girl and wear short skirt, you'd better choose the top with the same color of the skirt, so that your fat body will have a greater effect.
Team your shorts with sky-high heels and you'll instantly lengthen your legs - and no, we aren't talking about a pair of wedges, these are the hottest accessory of the summer!
If you are fat on top but have thin legs, you’d better choose a beautiful feeling of a one-piece dress.
Not only can it hide your belly fat, it can also show off your assets.
A-line short skirt is very thin, suitable for fat girls. Choose a body-hugging top to form a sense of layering and create a slimmer silhouette.
A simple white T-shirt and a short skirt would also look great on her. And MM can also try a fat suit.
The petite girl can also wear fashionable clothes.
Once mastering the art of dressing, the petite girls will be the center of attention in any crowd.
After the change in the aspect of clothing, I have to live more actively and seek to lose the label of being a fat girl as soon as possible in daily life.

Girl posts photos of herself as target for sister's archery practice: "It's okay even if I get hurt" - Xinhuanet
A girl was standing in front of a large wooden board at Whulin Square in Hangzhou. The board had the words "human target practice, one yuan, one arrow" written on it.
A picture of a girl in Hangzhou who asked her friends to donate money to help her play the archery "target" went viral on WeChat yesterday morning.
Photographs showed a girl standing in front of a tall wooden board at Wolong Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human target" and "¥10.1" written on it, suggesting that people can shoot archery after paying the fee.
The move triggered quite a response online.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the Xiangyang Sub-Bureau of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme action after she was recruited. However, such behavior is not worthy of imitation. After being informed, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Gang member who 'targeted' schoolgirl for recruitment is convicted
In a picture that was circulated on the internet, a girl with long hair was standing in front of a board made of wood, on which the words "human target 10 yuan and one arrow" were written in black ink. In front of her was another board on which her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay numbers were written.
The image triggered quite a response online.
Some netizens thought that this action was a "bluffing to buy", and many netizens agreed with them.
“We found the situation at around 10 a.m. on September 23 when we were patrolling the square. At that time, the crowd watching the event had already shrunk. ”
The policeman at the Tianjin Water Police Station near the incident accepted an interview of the local media and said that the girl on the billboard was 20 years old and dressed beautifully.
Among them, a girl who was playing "human target" was crying and asking passers-by to play the game; another girl, who was standing next to her, was holding a cup of drink and said her friend had leukemia and needed surgery, so please help.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou to understand that the girl was raising money for her sister's treatment of leukemia. "
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the Xiangyang Sub-Bureau of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Jia Jiayi, and she was the sister of Jia Jiayun, who had borrowed the money.
But the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan in cost, and they thought of nothing but borrowing money for a moment.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were only targets and the man was only the shooter, but they did not participate in the process and did not find any arrows during the process. It was only found out after the man took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
After the police of the following day handled the security department, it was identified that the bow used did not belong to the controlled scope.
The director said, "It is not advocated to adopt such a fund-raising method".
After being warned by the policeman on duty, she left the police station.
Thermal effect: good; lightness: easy; appearance quality: satisfactory; longevity: very high.
The new machine is very good.

Personally, I think that the Dark Shadow of the Horse Knight is quite good. Game effect: The game effect is comfortable, allowing most of the games to be played leisurely.

What's Hot for 2021?
Without doubt, it was the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think that only athletes with disabilities can win awards?
A few days ago, an article entitled "The Quicklook Project Manager Can Win the Olympic Gold" was very popular, in which it was mentioned that project managers can absolutely be the first to arrive at many projects and no one can beat them: moving bricks, working overtime, and even staying up late are common for project managers, while fire control, risk control, and apology are not on their agenda.
An article on the daily work of the project manager seems to be amusing at first glance, but it also reveals the daily hard work behind the scene, which represents the current project management work.
And people engaged in project management work will also gradually choose to break free from the difficulties in their work through some actions.
From the number of annual PMP (Project Management Professional) applications, we can see that more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "2019 China Construction Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)" report, as of September 2019, the number of PMP® candidates in China reached nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, which accounted for 31.2% of the total PMP® certification worldwide.
The number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing year by year, which means that more and more project managers realize that relying on simple experience to do things is no longer acceptable in today’s ever-changing work environment. The dynamic working environment makes us know that we should learn something new and explore the path ahead from the scientific perspective.
However, once you have a PMP certification, will it be easy to smoothly proceed with project management work?
Many project management beginners said that they could master the ten areas and five processes of project management through learning the relevant courses such as PMP and IPMP, however, when they actually carried out the project management work, they still felt like a fish out of water.
Many project managers often reflect the following issues: project management theory is not in place, they merely rely on personal experience, they have empty theories on project management, but don’t know how to put it into practice; they lack the systematic project management process and the support of the system, which makes it impossible to work in the project management, inaccurate estimation of the project cost and the gap between the control and the flexibility, the project is dragged on and on; the division of labor is not clear, the "rotten old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with the cross-departmental communication, the project is difficult to promote ... ...
Therefore, the dedicated innovation and R&D management has loads of burden in the fields of product innovation and R&D management, and has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers and project managers and gained the honorary title of "the training base for the management of talents in Chinese enterprises’ R&D management".
Online Course: Project Management Training for R&D Project Managers This is an online fragmented learning course, combining many real-life cases, tools and methods of numerous R&D enterprises, to help you grasp the knowledge and standard actions required of a project manager, and move up the ladder of your own project management.
This is also a way to let companies use lower costs and less investment to promote the process of project management and bring opportunities for high efficiency operation results to enterprises.
Without references, let's first see how other students comment on this course: This course is not only led by the expert team (the former Huawai R&D management team) of Central China and Huazhong University of Science and Technology, which combines the advanced project management methods of international first-class enterprises and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios, but also provides a comprehensive and professional interpretation of the course content.
It will even provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students convert the contents they learned into specific work after the course.

JD.com advocates rational consumption to consumers before the "Double 12" - ECNS - A professional financial news website
This year, the amount of online payment transactions of “Double 11” festival nationwide was 177 billion yuan, which was a new high compared with that of last year.
The abundant and reduction red envelopes bring direct transportation and let the consumer benefit twice. This consumption boom has both positive and negative aspects. On the one hand, it is a strong sign of the development of national consumer power. On the other hand, it also means that we must calmly reflect on the impact of consumption on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
Before “Double 12” day, JD.com issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially the young, to build good consumption awareness and consumption habits and avoid blind consumption and excessive consumption.
The results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank this year showed that the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, which was 2.04 higher than that in 2019.
On the whole, Chinese residents have performed well in financial consumption, but there is still a big gap in financial behavior and skills, which requires further improvement in the financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and “one-child one-allowance” will still be the focus of financial education continuously. The report on the "China's Young People's Debt Situation" released by Nilson and the 2019-2020 China Young Consumers Report released by CCTV show that young people have enormous consumption potential. The use of credit products has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people use credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt. Although the overall trend of rational consumption among young people is evident, there are some young people who have excessive consumption and follow the fashion, which has generated excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even caused the problem of social to gradually increase. Financial institutions should be responsible for social and take the positive guidance.
As a licensed financial institution, Shanghai Xiangyu Financial Co., Ltd. has always been committed to providing quality and caring services to help the masses build their own happy lives, and advocating that consumers form a correct consumption view and actively respond to supervision calls to improve the rational consumption awareness especially of young people.
In the past few years, China Youth Financial Literacy has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial literacy promotion activities for young people, including university students, and has properly guided young people’s consumption demand via innovative practice competitions in collaboration with top-tier universities, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, plan their consumption in a rational way, and accumulate wealth for their entire life.
The arrival of the Double 12 shopping carnival is an opportunity for Xiexin to remind all consumers to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct views on money, prevent blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid consumption borrowing mistakes to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
One must plan consumption in advance and pay on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life, such as car buying and home purchase.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also select formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant authorities have the qualification to operate.
In the future, Zhejiang Xinlian will bring more in line with the needs of consumers and diversified services through its mature and reliable consumer finance system and the continuous update of financial products. It will also help the public to improve their financial awareness and help consumers to form the concept of moderate borrowing and cultivate the habit of moderate consumption, so that it will become the consumer's lifetime trustworthy financial partner.

Vietnam News - The Coastal Cooperation Committee Should Address Common Challenges
The stops include Amman, Jordan; Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates; Qatar; and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that King Mohammed has visited Qatar since the embargo was imposed in June 2017 by Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Arab League, which has led to a major diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have cut ties with Qatar and imposed a complete ban on its diplomatic relations with it, accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal solidarity of the Hague and had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the January 2021 meeting of the Working Committee of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, when the bay countries signed a US-Cambodian brokered agreement for "cooperation and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore ties with Qatar that both countries had cut off when Doha was accused of backing terrorism.
The resolution of the conflict in the Gulf countries was to restore relations with Qatar, which was necessary to unite their interests and regional stability, and to confront common challenges.
During the visit of King Salman of Saudi Arabia to Aman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between two coastal countries in the two oceans.
The 725-km-long channel connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of the two countries' citizens and simplify supply chain management.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will inject $5 billion in Aman, and the two countries' enterprises have signed a 13-item cooperation memo worth $30 billion.
King Salman's visit to the Gulf countries is analogous to the fact that Iran, in spite of the fact that it had been blamed for the inability to solve the missile issues, had negotiated with the world powers for the Iran’s nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\n### Input:\n沙特王储对海湾国家访问之行恰逢伊朗与世界各大国就挽救名为《联合全面行动计划 》 ( JCPOA）的伊朗核协议 — — 一项海湾阿拉伯国家因认为无法解决与伊朗导弹问题而谴责的 协议进行谈判。\n\n### Output:\nKing Salman's visit to the Gulf countries is analogous to the fact that Iran, in spite of the fact that it had been blamed for the inability to solve the missile issues, had negotiated with the world powers for the Iran’s nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
The countries of the Persian Gulf have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council believe that not resolving the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran’s activities in the region is deficient.
After the major nations and Iran failed to reach an agreement in the nuclear negotiations, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors behind the economic growth of countries belonging to the Gwadar Port Authority.
The upcoming summit will be the first time for the countries of the GCC to hold a summit since the dispute between some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is a chance to promote the restoration of the GCC through diplomatic achievements, and to submit various measures to make its member states cooperate fully to deal with common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the countries in the Gulf.

The super loud sound of the trumpet was coming from the new mountain area!
This car is a dream come true for many men!"
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini - the Murcielago’s successor, the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the horse was around 20 million yuan, the road tax was no more than 10,000 yuan per year, and it had four rounds of driving. Why was it called LP700?
Imagine how fast you can go with 700 horses under you.
We do not know the speed of the little editor. According to data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h. That is, the speed of the myvi is probably already 100 km/h when it reaches 30 km/h.
Low-slung seats, a sharply creased dashboard, a huge air intake around the car and a glass-topped engine bay with a 6.5-litre V12 engine that could have been lifted straight from a Bentley, perfectly captured the spirit of the Lancia.
For the explanation of the car, it is enough to Google it. Little editor has compiled some explanations that Google does not always give!
Too popular to the extent that everyone is watching, which is very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's quite cool!)
1km of fuel costs about RM1 (the car owner doesn't care either way).
And be sure to practice your bowing, or you'll feel a bit awkward (because you'll be half in and half out of the car).

Let the spirit of university and the spirit of the times resonate together - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of study concepts and value pursuits developed by a university over the long run during its development process. It is the soul of a university.
Throughout history, the spirit of university has been very important for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern meaning, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. As for Chinese universities, the emergence of the university can be traced back to the national crisis in the autumn, and its spirit has been deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changing times. It advocates the value of "honor and integrity and pursuit of perfection", and takes on the patriotism responsibility of "making the country strong through education".
At present, the trend of internationalization and informatization of higher education is becoming increasingly prominent. The global competition in education, science and technology and talent is intensifying. As an important “supply side” in higher education, the structural reform of the higher education industry is confronted with unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Building World-Class Universities and Disciplines in China" has shown China's confidence and determination to move from a large country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, and has also raised the requirements for the development of colleges and universities.
How to quickly rise to the top in the world and build a few world-class universities and disciplines on a foundation of relative inferiority, achieving the "supercar" in the world?
In addition to being confident about goals, path and capabilities, colleges and universities should also fully exploit the three advantages: the advantage of being late-comers to the world's top universities by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from their advanced experiences, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and study quality; the advantage of cultural heritage to inherit the great cultural heritage of the Chinese civilization after five thousand years and to promote the development of outstanding traditional culture, thereby gathering forces, shaping brands, and enhancing images; the advantage of the system to give full play to the system superiority of socialist countries and strengthen the goal orientation, jointly build a consensus, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate and exceed the world's advanced level.
In particular, we must pay attention to the fact that building a world-class university cannot be done in a day, and that schools must highlight their individual characteristics and advantages while playing to their strengths.
The characteristics of the study must have a common Chinese feature, but also reflect the unique goal positioning, study tradition and resource endowment of each institution.
For Zhejiang University, three characteristics are highlighted in our study: first, it is a unique talent training program for innovative entrepreneurship, second, it is a combination of educational and vocational training to form an integrated environment for cultivating entrepreneurs, and third, it is an all-round education system for entrepreneurship; second, it is a unique feature of academic cross-talk meetings to promote the optimization and adjustment of the academic system and create an institutional environment for academic cross-talk; third, it is a feature of the study system and social services to carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation to accelerate the formation of a comprehensive partnership of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the university spirit, and let the university spirit coexist with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the “Seeking Excellence and Innovation” school ethos, “Sincere and Hardworking, Upright and Practical”, and “Hannan River and Qiusheng River, the spirit of enlightenment and the spirit of patriotism” jointly constitute the latest expression of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is the school insisting on the correct direction of study and constantly accumulating cultural high-level and gathering spiritual power as an important protection, which has rich connotations and lasting significance.
Among them, “Hainan River and Jin River” emphasizes the open and inclusive spirit, with the attitude of “using the talents of the world to serve me”, and performs the quality concept of extracting the world-famous education. “Enlightening the truth and fostering the virtue” stresses the truth-seeking and the pursuit of excellence, that is, the university not only pursues the truth in the name of science, but also shows the tolerance in the aspect of character building. “Awakening the spirit of the people” reflects the spirit of innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific innovation, and also represents the innovation in development and reform; “Tree of the Nation” stresses the spirit of patriotism, that is, the university should always share the same destiny with the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of 120 years of Zhejiang University’s education.
“The wise listen to silence and the sage see shapes”.
In order to further establish the overall interests of socialism with Chinese characteristics and deeply comprehend the era’s position and historical mission of the higher education, we must accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we must adhere to the humanistic care and independent spirit, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the nation stimulate each other, and provide unfailing impetus for the country’s prosperity and the nation’s rejuvenation to realize the common ideal of mankind.

Reading the news about friend's share price, the biggest impression is on the choice of the track, namely, the choice of the industry for investment. First, it is necessary to choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan; second, it is necessary to choose an industry with good growth prospects in the future, and consider the industry growth to be optimal in the next three to five years; finally, it is necessary to choose an industry with policy support.
The scope of the track is market size, and the length of the track is the stage of development of the industry. The flat or jagged nature of the track is the competitive landscape of the industry.

Complaints by American-Chinese Community Group about Three Stem-Sprouting Universities in Yulin - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington D.C. May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice Department on the 23rd, protesting against three Ivy League schools - University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, and Dartmouth College - which they claimed had discriminated against Asian applicants during admissions.
The day the Alliance for Bilingual Education, which had initiated the complaint, held a news conference in Washington.
Zhao Yukun, chairman of the organization, said at the conference that the number of Asian applicants who met the conditions of the US top-ranking universities has increased by times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian in these three US top-ranking universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities in the so-called "holistic assessment" admission process, "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants.
Zhao Yukui explained that according to the research done by Scholars like Sanders in 2014, the application rate of Asian-American students was the lowest among all ethnic groups at these three universities.
Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all the schools in the University of California system, both Brown University and the University of California, Davis, have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles, have implemented race-conscious admissions policies for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukui told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expected the US Department of Education and Justice Department to carry out an investigation after the complaint was filed, and to take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian applicants after determining the facts.
They also want complaints to be taken seriously by universities, which they say could lead to changes in admissions policies for Asian students.
So far, three of the universities complained about have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, and complained to Harvard University about discrimination in admissions at the time, but the US Department of Education denied the application for review.
The complaints this time around included Chinese Americans, as well as Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani and other Asian education groups.

Just canceled an order
Why still carry out the execution?
Can you help me check whether it has been canceled or not?
But I was up at 5.9 a.m. to place my order.
That's the hotline for ordering food, and they don't know what's going on.
Can I speak to him directly?
In September 2020, Mr Lu learned about a factory house at Yuyang Village, Shaoxing from his house. After many on-site visits, Mr Lu decided to purchase the factory house.
In the same December, Mr. Lu after negotiating with Lin, the owner of the factory building, transferred 200,000 yuan by way of bank remittance on the same day as the deposit.
Lim signed the "Factory Buy and Sell Agreement" as the buyer on the "Factory Buy and Sell Agreement" page. It was stated in the article that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller, and both parties shall sign the contract for the purchase and sale of the factory within one week".
However, later, due to the differences in the major contract terms, such as the scope of sale and payment methods, in the contract of buying and selling houses, the signing of the contract has been delayed again and again.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, Lim returned the 200,000 yuan to Lu in a few days.
It was not easy to see the house in the middle of the way, so we agreed on the price and made the deposit. However, the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Luang angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit in the People’s Court of Yuyang District.
After the court’s trial, the court held that the two sides finally failed to sign a formal contract, and it can only be held responsible for the defendant. It is reasonable to presume that the negotiation fails, and the case should not apply the fixed penalty. The defendant shall not be responsible for the breach of the obligation to return double the deposit.
After a first-instance verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals maintained the original judgment.
【Attorney Notice】 During the transaction, we should pay enough attention to the caution.
During the signing of the contract, as a buyer, you should pay enough attention to the cautionary duties, for example, verify the information of the property owner and whether the property has been occupied by people, etc., and clarify in the contract the specific time and place of delivery to prevent the dispute from arising when the contract is performed.
("Germany Voice", a Chinese website) The spokesman of Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhu Hua, said in the talkfest on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "leaders" peak meeting of democracy, which is "to draw a line of consciousness to put democratic tools and weapons, the fake democratic name to the contrary of democracy, and stir up the conflict to the transfer of internal contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has been strengthening its political system and value conception and imposing 'democratic reform', single-sided sanctions, and 'color revolutions' on others, resulting in disastrous consequences.
Democracy has already become the "big killing weapon" of the United States in interfering with other countries.
This summit was a chance for Biden to showcase his promise to deliver on his campaign pledges.
The two-day meeting was held in the video conference mode, and the leaders of 111 countries were invited to participate, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for the problems that have emerged in the United States itself, and said that the United States had no qualification to hold such a summit.
There were also voices of doubt from the international community and the United States. For example, some people doubted the real purpose of the summit, which was to invite leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who were critical of the summit, and they suspected that the real purpose of the summit was not democracy but geopolitical organization.
The newly elected German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, was also present at the video conference of the democratic peak.
The statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday claimed that "today's American democracy is full of problems, including money politics, identity politics, political party opposition, political polarization, social fracture, racial conflicts and income inequality", and the American democracy is a "game for the rich" based on capital foundation.
The U.S. President Trump said in his speech that, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, and achieve transparent accountability governance, and we can also better resist the force of monopoly and impact, and people who pursue power before the public interest. "
He emphasized that democracy was not inevitable, "We must constantly update it in each generation, and in my view, this is a decisive challenge in our era. "
Biden also said that "democracy and human rights are under sustained and worrying challenge all over the world," and that "democracy needs champions to defend it."
On the other hand, the United States has promised to carry out a four-year long action plan after the Democratic Summit, including a proposal of 4.244 billion US dollars to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support for independent news media.
The United States hopes that before the physical democracy summit planned to be held in late 2022, countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "let us all countries implement our commitment and report on the progress made next year".
Good, I was only afraid that he sent the wrong address.
Jichang Cantonese Restaurant (Five-Door Kitchen).
[Xiao He] Environment: Middle-level official banquet [Service bell] Service: The food was quickly prepared. “Gujifama” is my must-order dish. The gingerbread was too fragrant and too delicious. I’m sure my little companions, who love dessert, would love the “East River eel and black bean sauce” stew. The eel was fresh, and the black beans were crisp. There was a lot of...
Tasteful meat dishes, good service and warm-heartedness.
It has been a long time since I came to Changsha. I miss the fruits so much. Eating and drinking are so good here. I have a hunch that the first steamed bun I had was the authentic Southeast Asian flavor!
The shredded meat was cooked just right, with a good amount of sauce, and the roasted suckling pig was as flavorful as always, while the example of the steamed fish was also not bad, and the cucumber salad was also quite good.
Taste is satisfactory. Service is warm and meat is good.
Yichang old store. A few years ago, it was also a netizen. The wooden floor is old and musty.
We had to wait a long time for the dishes that we ordered, and the pots of congee were all broken...
I haven't eaten at Jianchang Restaurant for a few years now. The rise and growth of various small stores has scattered the customer flow.
It was hard to find a seat in the shop, but the food quality was not bad. It was as good as before.
Tasteful meat dishes are praised by the majority.
Yichang foreign trade.
Mi Faan: The food was a little disappointing this time.
The three cups of chicken: a bit more vegetables, a bit less chicken meat.
The flavor was a bit off. The aftertaste was not pleasant, just like the sweetness was highlighted but not balanced by the savory ingredients. Maybe it’s a brain-teaser for those who can guess the sweetness + various flavors of the ingredients...
What is the penalty for drinking and driving?
Tastes differ, of course, but some people collect, some people eat, and others drink - and one of the most popular Scottish whiskies around the world at the moment is the Red Label, which has won the International Wine and Spirit Competition's gold medal.
Each bottle of red wine has its unique flavor, however, if one does not know how to appreciate it, it is not at all bad to drink it.
So what does it mean to be a Red Card Warrior?
The editor introduces the topic simply for everyone.
The traffic police said:
The award-winning Wemyss Malts Innocent Bystander is a blend of around 35 Scottish malts, with a rich and sweet style as well as the characteristic flavour of traditional Scottish malt, with a sweetness balanced by a smoky and phenolic edge.
The aroma is fresh and grassy, with a subtle sweetness and a heavy, toasted malt flavor.
It can be drunk on its own, or mixed with the drink of your choice.
At the time, the Red Star branded beer was introduced into the domestic market, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese, the Red Star branded beer + cassette or snow white cassette or new wonder cassette has become a kind of fashion that never fades away.
These flavored beverages, in addition to being able to enhance the sour taste, can also give people a sense of comfort through the visual effects, and can also alter the mouthfeel of the beverage.
A red date with chopped orange and black sugar is the most authentic and orthodox way to have baijiu.
The sweet taste of red wine is slightly acidic, and the addition of sugar can neutralize the acidity. Meanwhile, the orange flavor of the orange peel brings a fresh taste to the wine, and the sweetness can be adjusted according to one’s personal taste.
The above three kinds are the best drinks for the Red Bulls. Everyone can try these drinks as a reference. Hope the introduction of the small editor can help everyone.
Education thought: how the college entrance examination makes the "study abbot" and the "study model" get their deserved results-Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou University of Technology wrote a letter to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university entrance examination and to propose that the difficulty of the examination be increased, the type of the examination be changed, and that the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Yes, for a long time, college entrance examination has been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, with different ability levels and study levels. In addition, the learning situation is different.
To subject a group as diverse as this to such scrutiny is bound to invite disagreement.
To be sure, if the test questions are too repetitive and the topics are too simple, it is bound to cause a feeling of another kind of stark contrast.
Students who don’t work hard enough might be able to get into a good college by taking advantage of early action, but if they want to maximize their chances, they should probably apply to several other schools as well.
In this case, those who have no time to study can also get rid of them and even get high scores; those who are “studying” while they are not attending classes, doing their homework and taking notes are quite common, and those who take exams are not high-spirited.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University of Technology have reflected the problems that exist in the college entrance examination and that this is not an uncommon situation.
From this level of meaning, we can praise these three students for writing the letter.
In fact, those who have graduated from college know that those who “attack” the college entrance examination and think of various ways to prepare for the examination can be seen everywhere, and even those who “borrow” questions from teachers and seek to expand the scope of the college entrance examination by taking the initiative to study are not uncommon. Even the situation in which students ask their teachers for help after the examination and seek high scores is not rare.
As far as the writer is concerned, as a kind of teaching quality evaluation direction, the alignment of a university entrance examination and the comprehensive grasp of teachers on the teaching and learning of science constitute the scientific problems based on this foundation.
When entering the undergraduate course, the majors began to specialize. Many major courses are based on knowledge.
It is doubtful whether one has fully mastered the basic knowledge points of a certain discipline after several years of study, which is what the college entrance examination is designed to evaluate.
The basic knowledge of undergraduate is usually the academic basis theory and the basic common sense in an academic field. In terms of knowledge points, the space of change is not large. It is basically fixed.
As what the teacher said, “The basic knowledge of mathematics which one learned in university 20 years ago, one should still focus on it now. ”
But the points of knowledge do not change, and it does not represent that the test type is single and the questions are repeated.
In many colleges and universities, the tests are usually made up of a group of questions, and then the test papers are collated and organized by the senior teachers of the relevant departments. The teachers of the same department also participate in the examination, so that to some extent, the problem of repetition of tests can be overcome.
However, it is necessary to put forward a set of test items that accord with the actual situation of teaching and learning, and the title of the test item should be positive and normal distribution according to the overall situation of student learning, and the comprehensive understanding of the educational situation, so that the test items can dynamically grasp the difficulty and the type of the test, can expose the foundation knowledge inspection and can also combine with the ability inspection, and meanwhile, the test items can be innovatively designed according to the type.
College entrance examination is the commanding rod of university education. What kind of college entrance examination, students will have corresponding preparation plan. Longer the time goes, the effectiveness of university education will be affected.
For the suggestions from students, Lanzhou University has always attached great importance and has comprehensively deployed the rectification plan.
It is required that the teaching units organize the teachers to carry out the seminars and end-of-course exams against the self-examination, to develop the examination questions and relevant systems, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination questions and the review process, and carry out the comprehensive assessment of the course, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the course teaching in all links.
The mechanisms to solve the problems of question type singe and the problems of repetition of topics are the issues that the college exams need to face, and of course, the corresponding system needs to be introduced, but the hard work is worthy of reward, so the teachers need to have an overall understanding of the teaching situation, not only see the academic content, but also see the students' learning situation, and then the teachers and students can have better contact, which will make the examination better reflect the actual situation, so that the "studying" and "studying" can get their due.

Jin Fujin Photo Studio (Nanjing Store) has not yet split into branches.
As we didn’t arrange the time beforehand, the photographer changed his time twice, and advised us to arrange the time. Lanlan was very patient with us arranging the time.
They chose a good weekend to take some pictures.
Ms. Jin's staff members, from consultants to makeup artists to photographers, were all superb.
That was my first time to go to the beauty salon formally, and I was so nervous that I couldn’t believe that I would become so handsome one day, ha ha.
Xiaoju and her other sister (sorry I forgot her name) were very patient and their makeup was very natural.
The scenery was taken while shooting at the Yangtze River Delta City. We were fortunate that the weather was good that day, and we didn’t feel too cold while shooting. The makeup artist kept reminding us of our clothing, headwear, and accessories, and immediately helped us when we asked for it.
The photographer was very humorous, and felt very happy every day that passed.
When taking photos, we are unwilling to delete too many photos in case there are many cases online. But when taking photos, we really don’t care about adding a few more photos. We just want to eat our fill and take a few photos (it is said that I am not much different from a bride whose bridal photo I took. At that time, I was shocked and scared that I had taken more than 10,000 photos).
Today, the pictures were finished, Lanlan sent them to me, and I saw that they weren’t very good, so they quickly helped me redo them.
I compared the photos my sister had taken before and I felt that our photos were really nice, simple and stylish, which was exactly what I wanted.
Seriously recommend everyone to take a look at the photos of Lady Han taken with her wedding dress on!
Set price: 3,999 yuan.\n
Mrs. Fang thanked you for your sincere wishes and hoped you a happy and prosperous year ahead!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah not registered for special anti-fake paper policy\n
（Aqaba, October 11） The Civil Registry of Saudi Arabia said that it has been unable to issue birth certificates for newborn babies on October due to the special ink used for counterfeit prevention, which has affected 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the center, Kulanu Amis, assured us that all the babies that have applied for birth certificates will have their data recorded in the system and will receive their certificates next week.
He explained at a news conference that the report on the problem of fake news printed by a web media agency has lasted for 10 months.
He said the issue arose two months ago and that Sandra had faced the same problem.
“One reason is that the Chinese factories that produce specialty paper for counterfeit money are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in delivery to China. "
He explained that the security paper used in the ballot papers of Samba was different from that of other regions, and therefore it could not be used as a reserve for other states.
Cai Luaminos revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on September 6, and was handed over to the printing company on September 8 for partial printing.
“The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur to buy goods next Thursday, and then rush back to Sabah to carry out the final printing. It is estimated that more than 2 working days (on December 20) can be handed over to the applicants. "
“Applicants should collect the application form from the local branch. ”
He added that the city has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates since the beginning of this year.

Video reveals truth of US military massacre in Panama for 20 years - Xinhuanet
（Video source: Oil管）
On December 11, an oil platform called "Kill Machine" micro-documentary drew extensive attention.
The film describes how the United States launched the Afghan war under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", and used the war to forcefully export American democracy. For 20 years, the Afghan army, Hutu, Heavy-handed and murderous, has committed various human rights violations.
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles to spy on hospitals, schools and other civilian sites, as well as the manipulation of human rights, to establish a murderous group.
The US military has killed thousands of Afghan civilians in the last two decades.
US military set up "black sites" to torture "suspects" in various ways and inflict physical suffering.
A single act of anti-humanitarian crime triggers more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is becoming more and more violent.
This war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but has left the country and countless people dead and maimed.
Watch the video, let's peep together the true face of America, which is called "the land of freedom" and masked by a false democracy!

So everyone is sure to ask: why is the warranty period for the package one year, but that for the hearing aids is two years or even longer?
Or: Why is the price of the earphones so much different from the price of the bag?
In fact, this is the beginning of many consumers, or the mother's opinion that because of the different raw materials, the quality is much better.
In fact, the raw material is the same, but people think that what is valuable is what is good.
Some consumers even responded after eating the product that it was not what they had expected in terms of taste or flavor!
Now, I'd like to take a moment to talk about why listening is so valuable, where it's valuable, and what we can do to make sure it's valued even more.
Why is the price of the raw material so different?
Because most manufacturers consider the situation that if the retail price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, resulting in low profits, or even losses, for manufacturers, what are manufacturers to do to survive?
So they have a huge upside in terms of protecting their profit margins by having the pricing power that they do.
Therefore, most of the factory owners advocate listening rather than packing.
There are also the millions of dollars in advertising fees that manufacturers spend every year to have their products featured on the show. Where do those fees come from?
Go figure.
As the society develops, the market promotion expenses, such as the commission of shopping mall promoters, the display fees of shopping malls, the subsidy expenses of products, and the advertising expenses, have continued to increase.
So all factories are constantly increasing new products, and these products are also in the form of listening, and their prices are rising constantly. Actually, this is new products emerging in the market with increasing market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. However, the cost of their raw materials increased by no more than 3 to 4 yuan.
There were also some brands that used doctors as a means to promote their products, by paying them to hang posters, distribute leaflets, and even give lectures about their products, and earning profits of up to RMB 80 for each RMB 30 spent.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operation methods, and in fact, such actions are harmful to consumers.
Parents are advised to buy a box of cereal and pour it into the can, which would save money and increase the durability and sealing of the cereal, without affecting children in any way.
In addition, do not think that the warranty period of the earphone is longer than that of the package. If the warranty period of the earphone is the same as that of the package after opening the package, it is just that the earphone after opening the package is not easy to preserve and easy to be affected by moisture.

Don't push people around at the starting line-Xinhuanet
When browsing in the bookstores, we are often impacted by the explosive popularity of successful learning materials.
Nowadays, successful textbooks generally promote the following principles: first, assume that you can “do it”; and then tell you what to do.
which is to say the bit about how to do it.
This is the common trait of these books - either you work hard to make it perfect or you don’t work hard and just leave it as it is; either you make it to the top of the mountain or you are so fragile that you can’t bear any pressure; either you get 100 or 0 on the exam.
This kind of "best principle" will be universally recognized as "incontestable", but will fool 99% of people before they start running.
The idea that this is a theory that "pushes you to be resolute, to change completely and turn around 180 degrees" is actually a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who resist, follow the old ways and refuse to change, you will definitely shout at them, "You must change", which is definitely self-delusion and bullying.
Most people would be stuck at the crossroad of “transition” for a long time, hesitating and vacillating; or would make a decision based on momentary enthusiasm and take the first step, but would soon run into obstacles and fail to keep going, which is usually the case.
The iconic opening sequence of Mr. Masihi’s “From Tomorrow,” in which a young man sings a classic about a “general humanity,” is one of the best examples of this genre.
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often beyond the extreme limit that the majority of people can reach. And it makes the majority of people "gatecrash the party".\n\n### Input：\n“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。\n\n### Output:\n“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。
Perhaps the "principle of succession" is a way for more people to walk the path of relative success.
The core idea of “Low-key at first” is to “reduce the threshold” - it encourages the theory of “small wins for big wins”, i.e., even if you don’t reach 100%, just making 1% progress is good enough: 1 is always better than 0; even if you don’t climb to the top of Mount Tai, as long as you reach the doorstep of your home, that’s good enough, because it’s better than not having taken any steps at all.
Essentially, no matter what you do, you're screwed.
Thanks to the large reduction in the threshold, it is now possible for ordinary people to stick to it and increase the probability of success as long as they stick to it.
However, the path to success in following the "principle of priority" has been somewhat lengthy.
Overall, the "best principle" on the surface seems to be a successful flagship for everyone, but it can ultimately inspire only a small number of people; while the "principle of succession" can effectively inspire more people, and possibly benefit more people.
So, do I need to place a new order?"
No-one answered the phone.
They never give up.\n\n### Translation:They never give up.

The volume of fish resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 thousand tons - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Ningbo, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiao) Reporters learned from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the accumulated volume of raw material resources for the bare shrimp of Lake Taihu this year was 0.71 million tons, reaching 10.85 million tons, which was 40 times more than that in the early protection of 2002.
The famous “Skinny Fish” in Qinghai Lake is a special fish species in Qinghai Lake with unique characteristics. It plays a crucial role in safeguarding the ecological chain and biological diversity of the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as extensive fishing and the declining water environment of the Qinghai Lake, the number of Qinghai Lake’s roach declined sharply. In 2002, the reserves of Qinghai Lake’s roach was only 2,592 tons.
The Finless Porpoise was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red Book in 2004.
From 2003, Qinghai Province implemented the closure of lakes to raise fish, and banned any entity, collective, or individual from fishing in any of the major rivers and tributaries of Qinghai lakes and reservoirs as well as the sale of fish and their products.
At the same time, by continuously increasing the protection intensity through the artificial breeding and release and cleaning the main inflow and outflow channels of Qinghai Lake and designing the scientific and reasonable "passage for fish passing", the accumulated resources of bare-skin fish in Qinghai Lake increased annually.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, the artificial propagation and release of Qinghai Lake had reached nearly 180 million fry, with the contribution rate of Qinghai Lake resources for the restoration of Qinghai Lake reaching more than 23%.
The three rivers source area of Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source recharge area in China and even in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and an ecological functional area which controls the eastward spreading of the arid region in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges source area and the Qinghai Lake watershed, and to protect the wild animals in the water, and to maintain the diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau biological diversity, Qinghai Province has released the notices of fishing ban in the key waters of Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has built an "one river and one lake" comprehensive fishing management system.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which I had to put in the bag, and the weather was cold.
Do you think they are packed in a box?
We only saw one bag.\
Want to know if you sent it or if we took it, thanks.
It has been one hour and they still have not sent it.
I just saw a very long article written in a style that was too familiar.
a quick lesson for the uninitiated male gaze.
Most girls go through their first period aged between 13 and 15, and it's over by the time they're 50.
After that, I will come back to see him every month as a rule.
but it is not law that can accurately predict the deviation and the advance preparation is required in case of about one week. Sometimes the deviation is also unpredictable (suddenly turn around in a few days).
The duration, bleeding and painfulness are different from person to person. Some people need to take medicine for three days, some people for a week; some people have less blood, some people have big blood cough; some people have no reactions, some people are painful to the ambulance running, and the pain will change with the time. Some people have no pain does not mean a person without pain.
With the inability to control the bleeding, I had to keep wiping the blood with a health towel or sanitary napkin to prevent it from flowing onto the chair.
The main reason for the pain is the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone. Since the biological period just begins, the pain can be effectively relieved by eating blueberries at the beginning of the month. After the pain begins, it is useless to eat anything.
Due to the excessive blood in the uterus and the release of too much progesterone before the birth, the abdomen is easily expanded.
If it's around the period, Momo will get fat in her stomach, which is basically two days of not eating.
The best time to change the towel is after two to three hours, or else it will be easy to breed bacteria. In addition, the sleep time should be eliminated. The worst case is to change the towel 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 pieces a month. If possible, 50 pieces can be prepared in advance. In addition, it is not necessary to use a new towel every month.
（Here, the cotton swab is changed every five to six hours, and no more than eight hours.）
The full moon may cause mood swings, and the menstrual period will be unstable due to the hormone changes during the period. It is very frustrating and tiring to make efforts to deal with it.
But the official crime statistics reveal that women are able to restrain their emotions very well, and never use emotional issues as an excuse.
The blood is not the only thing flowing; there is also amniotic fluid that is breaking.
After the end of the moon, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly becomes thick, that is, the endometrium is a house, and every month, it is ready for the arrival of guests. The guests do not come, so everything is dismantled (the endometrium is thickened) and next month, a new house is built again. And the cycle goes on.
It is very inconvenient to have a lunar month, and for many years, the lunar month lasts for several days every month with blood flow. Who would like to go through this?
But the fact is, we exist because our mother went through a difficult monthly cycle - a process that lasts 10 months and prepares a woman for the first time in this world - and we thank our mother for her healthy monthly cycle.
Previously, women were oppressed in many ways, and society told women that they were dirty, disgusting, and inferior, but times have changed.
And if you feel that having a bad moon is a female body preparing for pregnancy is disgusting, and if you think that girls should stand up when such words are spoken, you should stop and think before speaking, because such men will never experience what they are talking about, and it is disgraceful for men who are not familiar with the situation to make light of such injustice.
Finally, we tried out the health benefits of cotton candy, and it was really useful.
Today is the winter solstice, and the weather is quite disappointing.
You should order something else for the little friend to eat.
Check the goods in the store carefully.
Is the sweat pore emitting electricity?
Choose the appropriate foot bath can play a good foot care. Today, the editorial team of National Geographic will answer the question and hope to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the bidet has become more and more popular with consumers. A large number of different products have appeared on the market in terms of both price and quality. The bidets range from more than 100 yuan to more than 1000 yuan. This has given consumers a lot of choice.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, sanitary ware has sold well, but the safety hazard of sanitary ware is hidden because it does not have special industry standards. Therefore, there is a certain degree of safety hazard.
It is so dangerous to take a bath in electrified water!"
Mr Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a present for his father, but his father felt an itching sensation in his feet after putting them in the bath.
Mr Li started to massage his feet, but unexpectedly, the vibrating function was triggered. His father felt that his feet were tickled.
Mr. Li tried one stroke with the electric brush, and surprised to find that the brush was working, Mr. Li tried again and again until the basin was full of water.
He then contacted the store, who were understanding, if a little disappointed that the bowl had been returned. Mr Li said he was still not happy.
Because he found that the foot bath, which has long been popular, has no clear industry regulation on the settings of highest temperature, application to which people and materials are protected from harm and so on.
But in general, the problem of electric shock will not exist, but the products do not meet the rigorous inspection before shipment.
Therefore, at the time of purchase, choose the separate foot bath.
Isolation by water and electricity, without any safety hazard.
You can also take a pencil test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Vision - Hunan Daily Web - China Voice Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 wire (full media reporter Zhang Shaowu, Huan Huan, communicator Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) -- Today in the morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovative tea science and technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the target of the tea industry to make the tea industry a 100 billion industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the China National Council for the Promotion of Supply-Side Cooperation and Ye Hong, deputy director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee attended the opening ceremony.
Academician Liu Jihua of the Chinese Academy of Engineering introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of hong hong tea is new, and the red tea hill rises to the new force of "Five-colored Hunan tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the billion-yuan tea industry in Hunan, and formed the development pattern of "three Hunans and four waters and five colors tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main categories, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of the tea tourism, which has driven the increase of tea farmers.
The wind changed direction and the red tea got stronger.
Tea experts in the province said that after harvesting green tea, black tea, and red tea, tea farmers would have income for the whole year, and the value of the tea garden would rise directly.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates of authorization to the enterprises in the fourth batch which use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and joyously celebrated the "source of Hunan red tea".
At the New Tea Gallery, tea merchants from Fujian Province ordered a high mountain tea called “Winter Spring” immediately after they saw it.
Wang Jianhong, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the current epidemic and other factors may have a certain impact on the tea market, but there are bright spots on the tea exhibition site.
A cup of red tea, with the culture of tea as its ink, is a popular and flourishing market. The tea industry in Hunan Province welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, do they still need to be discarded?
I don't want to, because he couldn't get off because we couldn't stop the car.
The phrase “figurative interpretation” refers to the problem of answering questions that cannot be directly answered through sensory perceptions by using reasoning and logic.
That shape is the basic principle of philosophy, which aims to explain the essence of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of “shape and speak” is from the “Shih Er Shih Chieh” in the “Chi Yi” of the Confucius sayings, which is translated as “shape and speak” by the Japanese person Jinshiro Jing (a person in the Meiji era), and it means that the shape of an object is its function.
The sub-branches include metaphysics, natural theology, and their extended issues.
The main part of the discussion is about “which names represent true existence entities and which names only represent a concept”.
Shapeism, the belief that nature is all there is.
Its theoretical basis believes that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, and have been proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
And the method of naturalism refers to the research method that God is not to be interfered with.
The philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two-state solution and the one-state solution are the two major camps of thought for discussing the “relationship between spirit and flesh”.
The philosophy of knowledge is a branch of philosophy that explores the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic thinking and research of human moral life; here, ethics refers to all the rules of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It can be mainly divided into ethics of virtue (the abstract study of ethical theory or the criticism of ethical views), and normative ethics (the evaluation of different moral views and the provision of ethical standards for right or wrong behavior).
The researchers should follow the ethical norms (the code of ethics of what kind of behavior), apply ethics (the academic study of how to apply ethical theory to real life, including biomedical ethics and political ethics), and describe ethics (collect information about how people live, and draw a conclusion from the observed styles).
It is not a theoretical start point to review ethics, but the actual choices made by the moral agent (the one who is surveyed) and observed by the researcher, which means that all the factors that influence the decision-making process are considered, and the discussion of the ethical perspective held by the social group is carried out.
The history of ethics includes Greek Roman ethics, Christian ethics in the Middle Ages.
Part One: Humanistic ethical thought, with Confucius, Mencius, and other representatives as examples.
Part Two: The ethical thought of religious reform, with Confucius as a representative.
Part Three: Political Ethics, with people like Machiavelli as a representative, modern ethics (17th-18th century British experience ethics, representative people: Hobbes, Locke, etc. 17th-18th century, European rationalism ethics, representative people: Spinoza, etc. 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representative people: Voltaire, etc. 18-19th century, German Academy ethics, representative people: Kant and Hegel, etc. 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative people: Bentham and Mill, etc. 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative people: Shaftesbury and Sidgwick, etc. 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representative people: Lipps and Windelband, etc. 19th century, British moral sense theory ethics, representative people: Shaftesbury and Harrison, etc.).\n\n### Output:\u8f90\u52b6\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\u5927\u548c\

Ding Zilin: A friend.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to all friends who have given humanitarian aid to our family in the wake of the death of our relative in more than 30 years. Especially for the humanitarian aid appeal I made to our friends both at home and abroad in my personal name in early 1994, which has never been interrupted.
Now, most of the victims' elderly parents have died, and the survivors have grown up and settled down.
It was your generosity that helped us get through the most difficult times for these families.
At present, the new coronavirus epidemic is raging globally, and most donors have retired from the front line.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop hurting us by collecting money from the mother-goddess group in Tiananmen. This humanitarian activity should have a perfect ending.
I will always cherish the love that you have shown and I know that the justice that you have done will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive me friends!
I am truly blessed to have you in my life.
The ceramic industry has allowed me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation for Social Services (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Development Fund (MCDF).
Through the process of providing humanitarian assistance, the USCC and the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party are parallel organizations, and the implementers of projects often cross paths.

Donations often fail to reach the victims of the June 4th massacre.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group called “Tiananmen Mother” was formed, and fund-raising and distribution were coordinated and managed.
In 1998, MCDF set up the “Sixth June Vocational Education Fund”, and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth children had graduated from university, MCDF set up the “Fund for the Aid of June Fourth Vulnerable Persons”, and has implemented this fund ever since.
The funds mainly came from campus and social donations in the year of the June 4th incident, personal compassionate donations, and the support of the Democratic Campus and Student Union.
He will receive the foundation’s support from 2018.
It was not until last year, 31 years after the incident, that the victims of the June 4th massacre finally received part of the donations offered by the Hong Kong public in the name of the June 4th incident.
During this period, China Human Rights also carried out its independent humanitarian projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called off the June 4 donation event as he considered the donors, and we are indeed a group of retired people. Our income is not as abundant as it was before retirement, so we thank Teacher Ding for his consideration.
We will respect the decision to discontinue this project within two years and restore it immediately when needed.
For those who have consistently demonstrated compassion and bravery in the face of risk, delivering humanitarian aid to those in need, we express our deepest gratitude and respect.

Hello, can you help me to contact with the rider to ask whether he is still on the road?
I did not receive any order and checked the restaurant, but there was no food. No one contacted me to inform cancellation.
There is usually a foreign trade, and the management office will call to ask if the person can be sent over. If the management office has never contacted me, I will refuse to accept the person.

There are #PRS_ORG# witnesses, but no one dares to take action, #PRS_ORG# has been framed by me.
I repeat, it is a single-mindedness that I am after.\n
When everyone is finished, you don't have to send food out, and then I'll just help myself to the leftovers.
I want you to cancel immediately or I will call the police.
Taking photos at the time of the shooting. No sub-stores yet\n
Member feedback\n
Photo effects: took two shots of the same outfit. Overall, not bad. I like this set of pictures quite a bit.
Service detail: because pregnant women are not comfortable at all during makeup At the time of makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very attentive to me, allowing me to rest at one side, and constantly giving me cold water.
Set includes: 1000 yuan.
Thanks for the comments, Tuxedo. Originally, I didn't think the antiquity was suitable for the antiquity. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.\n\n
Thanks for the recognition, Dan. Your satisfaction fuels us to keep charging ahead, and we will!
This photo studio is really great! Strongly recommend all partners to come here!
No matter it was about greeting, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography or later on, she would not allow any improvisation.
The makeup artist will pay close attention to your style and pair you with makeup that suits you, and the makeup they use are all high-end brands.
Mr. Tian Liang (teacher) does not need to say more, photography is a decent job.
The whole office was very artistic, and there were two little cats as companions.
We were in Beijing for the first show. Beijing has many good theaters. We need to book the tickets for the first half of the year in advance. My colleagues who were in Beijing for shooting had watched the trailers and thought they were just so-so.
He purposely went to this workshop, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we feel that this is a common problem for most people. The photographer took pictures while we were recording the natural scenery.
Make-up artists, photographers, later designing - a great team.
The dishes served were applauded by both ourselves and those around us.
The recommendation of honey has already been passed, and the honey just watched the bottom film and was very happy.
I hope that this kind of workshop is not buried, and more people can find their own style instead of following the same style.
Thank you very much for the five-star rating and the generous comments. Both of you are new customers with great ideas and creativity. We are a creative studio and we will try our best to complete the project as you like. Thank you for your understanding and support.
Sweet assistant, lively photographer teacher, and every member of the team are super nice and beautiful. It is a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience. The effect of the shots is better than what I imagined. We worked hard, so thank you very much 😘😘
Thanks for your comments. It is also a kind of affinity to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust we have is so much more than the distance of a thousand miles. I am very happy to meet you. I hope I can come to Qinhuangdao next time to have fun.
How do I get paid?

Now the restaurant staff called me.

If you intend to enter this industry, you can choose to receive training somewhere else, but if you don’t have such an idea, it’s still okay to study on your own. After all, the money spent on training is a lot, and it will take 6 months to study.
But if you are looking to get into this industry, training is a very good option, especially for those who are self-employed or those who are vulnerable.
Those who are self-disciplined can choose to study on their own. However, it will be tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
Firstly, let's look at the teaching force of this institution. If the teaching force is not strong enough, then the training institution is meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions have teaching forces that are not particularly strong.
Else, it is advisable to find out about the training institution before making the choice. It is advisable to find out about the students of the institution so that you can know what to expect from the institution.
Hello, I do not know how to answer your question because you have not made a certain introduction of your own situation and there is a great relationship between learning this thing and one's own situation.
For example, your professional background, age, the language you want to learn and even the city you are in are all relevant to the industry you are going to work in or want to work in.
If you are a student and haven’t graduated yet, or you are a computer professional who has graduated and are looking to brush up on your skills, then I recommend self-study as this will give you the lowest cost and highest efficiency. Nowadays, many online and offline training institutions are very good, but the cost of learning is high and the time invested is relatively more. So, basically, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
However, if I say this situation, it is very convenient, because there are many learning resources on the network, which are free, or you can also go to baidu to find many training resources. If you can’t find resources, you can contact me to get free resources, or detailed consulting.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video integration to further enhance learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can spend some time and money on learning, we recommend you to learn in a training institution. You will not spend much time and money on learning, and the teachers will explain in detail. In addition, there are also people who answer questions specifically. Moreover, there are also help from learning plans or supervision.
And now, many training institutions will sign employment contracts, with internship quotas, and will recommend students to companies after the study, so the job interview can be saved a lot of things.
These are my views. I will not go into details because I do not know your situation. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication and exchange.
I was watching it on my phone a minute before it happened.
What's up.
I haven't even started talking and you want to know what I'm going to say?
I can install, clean, maintain and repair all kinds of water heaters, purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, sinks, mixers, showers, faucets, light fixtures and glass polishing tools, and provide professional and quality home services.
Thank you to those who have been quietly cheering me on, those who have been going through their own struggles but still manage to push on and make things work. Life is tough but we’ve all got to push on.
No life is ever easy for anyone who is trying to make something of himself. I love that you're paying attention and thanks for the silent cheers.
That's just life. Others only see the results, but you have to go through the process yourself and face life. Despite being strong, we just have to keep going, there's no choice but to keep going... even if you can turn around and look, you can't turn around and go back.
Cleanliness is the job and responsibility, and life is beautiful because of service. Service is wonderful because of heart.
No matter how dirty we were, we would use the most careful attitude to clean every corner of the customer’s home, and we would be so proud to see the satisfied smile and the raised thumb of the customer. At this moment, all the tiredness was worthwhile and there was a return!

A day is counted from the morning, so all the good things begin from the morning. I hope you carry happiness, luck, health and positive attitude all day long. Good morning and good day.
As a child, happiness was something that one had; if one had it, then one was happy. When one grew up, happiness became a goal; if one reached it, one was happy. Only when one matured did one realize that happiness was a state of mind, and that one could be happy as long as one was aware of it.
Be the most authentic and best self, act based on one’s heart, and there will be no regrets in life; life is a journey, follow your own path, and life has two great treasures: a healthy body and a good mind; stay young and beautiful as you please!
At every stage of life, we will encounter different problems.
More often than not, it is not your ability that holds you back, but the courage to face up to things.
Since it cannot be evaded, it is better to face it frankly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be trapped and defeated; and if you face the difficulties courageously, the problem will eventually be resolved.
Chinese curator co-hosts Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art dual-year exhibition - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Guang) The first contemporary art double exhibition in Saudi Arabia - The Diriyah Contemporary Art Double Exhibition was officially opened to the public on the 11th at Diriyah Art District, a northern suburb of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.
This biannual exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Contemporary Art Foundation and the UCCA (Ullens Contemporary Art Center) in Beijing, and the UCCA (Ullens Contemporary Art Center) curator, Tian Paiyu, serves as the art director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biannual exhibition is “Feel the stones across the river”, which reflects the reform strategies adopted by the society during the period of social economic transformation, as well as the current predicament of Saudi Arabian social culture development.
This twin-year exhibition occupies 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition halls span across six interconnected buildings, presenting the exhibition in six sections: Touch the Stone Across the River, Inheriting as an Experiment, On the Edge of Thought, Walking Towards the Public, Beautiful New World, and The Spirit of Art.
Among them, more than 40% of the works were from 27 Saudi artists, including paintings, installation arts, and performance arts; the works from 12 Chinese artists were also well-received, with some artists using recyclable materials in a new way, such as Xu Bing in his series of “Stories on the Back of the Fish” (2014), which reconstructed a classical landscape painting with garbage.
Bakri, the CEO of the Dry Season Exhibition Foundation, said that he hoped that the biennale would establish an international dialogue, and that global audiences would have the opportunity to understand the cultural and creative industries and the innovation community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction with the outside world.
Tian Fayou said: "The goal of the dual-year exhibition is dual, on the one hand, it can allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation, on the other hand, it can allow Saudi audience to be absorbed into the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the two-week exhibition period. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges, the development of contemporary art, and more.

Yunnan: Regulating the management of rural public interest positions in accordance with the law - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) To continue to help the people who have been lifted out of poverty to find employment and to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of rural public interest positions as part of comprehensively promoting the revitalization of the countryside.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Rural Social Undertakings Office explained that at present, Yunnan has a total of 448,300 rural public interest positions, which are used for employing rural difficult-to-employ groups including the poverty-stricken, and playing an important role in helping the poverty-stricken to achieve income growth, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the rural public services capacity.
This new regulation was jointly printed by seven departments including the Yunnan People's Association, the Rural Revitalization, the Finance, etc. It would mainly standardize the objectives, funding, post development and management of rural public interest positions at the grassroots.
In terms of post development setting, the new regulation clarified that the setting should be made according to the principles of "needs-based setting of posts, assignment of posts to qualified persons, dynamic management, and total quantity control" and "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible for the use" in the light of the principles of "one post, voluntary openness, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be conducted in the order of announcement, application, review, publication, appointment, on-the-job training and arrangement of appointment.
Moreover, the new regulation also clearly defines the specific duties of the rural public interest positions, the standards of allowance and compensation for the rural public interest positions, and the methods of compensation. It stipulates that the development departments of rural public interest positions shall purchase commercial insurance for the settlement of the rural public interest positions against accidental injury. The relevant departments are required to conduct supervision on the release of the allowance for rural public interest positions on a regular basis.

Hello.
Can the order be cancelled?
I re-ordered.
Has it been canceled yet?
2. Although the right-wingers had a glorious history in history, they lasted for a short time. So, they were short-lived because they drank the sunshine and sweated when the weather was hot; they also got cold when the weather was cool.
But in fact, the rightists played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the standard of the truth defined by the end of the Cultural Revolution, we can see that the rightists are positive in the aspects of economic development, science and technology, political and institutional reform, and the protection of human rights.
In my opinion, although I do not completely agree with some of the remarks made by Li Weide, I am very interested in his remarks, and very respectful of Li Weide as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and serious about Chinese social issues.
But I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I think that anti-revolution is necessary. Revolution must lead to social turmoil, damage to people’s livelihood and political chaos, which means that foreign countries can only be bystanders.
Fourth, we must have the patience and take the responsibility to serve the country for the people to change or improve the attitude of taking the side of the country and the people in politics. It is not right for the political gamblers to try to take advantage of the fire to become popular, which is not right for the right-wing, but is a mix of all kinds of evils.
Let's talk about something else.
Left, in fact, is a group of discarded ideas from the era and politics.
If the right has the positive meaning for the society, the Communist Party will also listen to the right words and analysis of their thoughts at the time when it needs. But the left has not been so-called because the left is what the Communist Party throws away at their leisure!
5, I recently noticed that some of my friends are very angry at the left and right, but I think it is not necessary.
Do not try to reason with Han Zhu and Li Pu. They are just stubborn and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that you are right, and don't try to make the thief and the left-winger admit they are wrong, either. Why bother?
I told my friends, when they called me out for five inches, and when they called me out for my right dog, I was like, 'Look, this middle ground that we're on is real!'
Many people forget their ideal or pursue it in a wrong way after they grow up.
And the ideal gradually fades away, and even the little dragon turns into an evil dragon in the end.
I think generally it refers to restraint and freedom. China is generally considered to be left-leaning as a result of its historical and cultural genes as the first civilization.
Meanwhile, the right-wing parties were free in China, concerned with efficiency and development, while the left-wing parties strengthened supervision and were more concerned with fairness and safety.
In the meantime, the society as a whole hopes that the focus would be on equality, while the China-U.S. competition is bound to continue for a long time.
Even though I don’t understand, I’ll give you a thumbs up."
No matter what, the flower is so beautiful.
In the last two years, the US sanctions on China's semiconductor industry have not only blocked the progress of Wafer, but also caused enormous losses to the "American companies".
The US government pressure on China's semiconductor industry may lead to a lock of orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers, which in turn may lead to reduced research and development investment and reduced capacity of semiconductor production enterprises, resulting in a disruption of the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, the "critical material" has spread to all major industries in the world, such as auto production, mobile phone price increases, and almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to grasp the independent rights of "chips", more and more countries' technology giants have begun to walk the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to tightly control the global semi-conductor control rights and develop the semi-conductor industry in China, the United States frequently uses its old tricks, and then it will host the "Chip Summit" or invite the 64 countries giant to establish the semi-conductor alliance, and then raise funds to support the domestic U.S. technology giants, such as the famous technology giant Intel invested $200 million to build two semiconductor fabs in Arizona, USA, to win back the dominance in the chip area.
When most people think of Intel’s move, they think it will certainly cause a certain impact on TSMC, and may even grab the “rice bowl” of TSMC.
This is because Intel, as a major American technology giant, has been engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves, so it is sure to rise rapidly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, the founder of TSMC, Zhang Zhongtian did not show any interest in this decision of Intel.
At the “2021 Teacher Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zongtang caused a sensation by speaking out against Intel’s investment in the Joint Venture, and said that Intel’s initiative to build a factory was quite laughable: Intel set up a factory for the purpose of producing chips, but the factory was nothing more than a joke.
Zhang Zongtong is so against Intel's invasion of the JEDI area because Zhang Zongtong has a grudge with TSMC lasting more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the bright spot in the U.S. electronics industry, and was the world's leading position in the semi-conductor industry.
Into the 1980s, the world's semi-conductor high-end chips were dominated by a small number of powerful players.
At that time, the half-conductor industry was characterized by the IDM mode. Chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model makes it difficult for some small businesses to afford. Many semi-conductor entrepreneurs can only watch the huge capital expenditure for production lines, while facing the reality of financing difficulties.
In response to market demand, in the 1980s, the integrated circuit industry began to practice subcontract cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongtang heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there is a specialized company, they can set up a factory specializing in the production of spheres.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Zhongtang’s dream became a reality, and Taiwan Power Company was born.
Taiwan Power Co. targeted the “polishing” stage as its main business, did not conduct design, and only provided outsourcing services for the manufacture of lenses.
The newly founded TSMC was a small potato in front of Intel, the giant.
To win capital support, Zhang Zongtang had once found Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC would only manufacture chips, it obviously underestimated TSMC and didn't want to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zongtang also believes that Intel was not looking for a round of M&A at the time.
It was not expected that the giant of not being able to manufacture circular-shaped products would have to start producing circular-shaped products.
So Zhang Zongtang felt that Intel’s entrance into the JD.com was quite humorous.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) has exceeded Intel.
Faced with the strong offensive of TSMC, Intel is also naturally cautious.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor has hit the 3nm mark while Intel is still stuck at the 14nm mark from 7 years ago.
It's not easy to overtake.
Not fair!
I ordered at 7:06 p.m. and it's only taken two hours!"
Today, let's take a look at some of the [strange search terms].
What is the normal public opinion?
Three hot spots were randomly selected: the Dragon Boat Festival in February, the rise in the price of Good Friends, and the event of the cargo theft. The sentiment spreading formed a peak, and then the [index declined] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If the sentiment generated has a small peak, it will repeat to appear again.
They look almost identical to the [online sentiment model] shown by the NetEase cloud music official website.
What is the mood of the nation?
Randomly choose six hotspots from the same event, and present [[isolated]], [[claw]], and [[cliff]].
Isolated incidents are likely to cause people to focus on them, and the rapid rise of the search engine results will attract people’s attention; periodic incidents are likely to cause people to focus on them, and the hot topics list will be guaranteed by the periodic heating; sudden incidents are likely to cause people to focus on them, and the hot topics list will be guaranteed by the sudden heating, and then the community will withdraw and the hot topics list will be played out.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and there is no more than a few seconds between them. So, the united group of amphibious assault vehicles must have received the mission and started a new round of attack.
The professionalization of blackmail is evident in the fact that dozens of hot searches hit the front page at the same time, which attract eye-catching features, which are responsible for science and technology, which are competitive for triggering the trend, which are transferring the focus of attention, which are affecting cognition, which are misleading judgments, which are arousing emotions, and which are considering the factors that influence the decision-making and the factors that are constricting the decision-making in the subtlety of the propaganda and the expansion of the public opinion. Almost all the elements are considered in the subtlety of the propaganda and the expansion of the public opinion.
Transmission is a scientific process that involves releasing all the subjective factors and only observing the objective data. In other words, the black box will be eliminated.
Leave a trace wherever you go, and such trace, we will unearth it together.

Do I need to stay in the dialogue?
I spoke to your staff and explained

I started from a friend's introduction because of trust. Therefore, I chose to see the initial budget of 70,000 yuan.
A series of scams began the moment I walked into the shop.
I had never been to the store before, but all they did was look at my size and didn't even ask me to come to the house to see if it was suitable. They just told me that the price of my 135 square metre apartment was negotiable, and that they could probably get me a better deal on the materials they use.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, you are surrounded by people who offer to help you carry your bags, even though you haven't asked for their help (and if you do ask, you will be told that the store does not allow it).
When I was buying my car, they invited their so-called manager to tell me that, as soon as I handed over the money, they would give me a discount.
It was a big hole, and I was just an example of somebody who had been living paycheck to paycheck and was just kind of robbed blind.
He had given me a lot of problems, the price did not include the water and electricity transformation, did not include any doors and cabinets, the bathroom was the only one that was included in the basic fee.
And they charge more than other companies for their service points.
I lost trust in this company that nothing was clear from the beginning.
When I went to collect the money from them, they acted very experienced, with a special little team to deal with you.
No matter what, it is the customer's problem and they are not responsible in any way.
There are so many responsibilities and a lot of details that I don’t want to go into because it’s all just tears, but ultimately you don’t want to choose them because the houses that they’re fixing up are not good quality and you’re going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want to choose them because the houses that they're fixing up are not good quality and you're going to have to pay all these different fees later on.\n\n### Input:\nAll sorts of things to think about, lots of details, don't want to go into it because it's all just tears, but ultimately you don't want

A double-star rain storm in the sky greeted the 14th day of the month in a big way—Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou RuiJian) Astronomers said that the double-star rain of the one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere this year would be very prominent on December 14. The friends who love meteor showers may observe it after half past midnight on that day.
A Beijing-based astronomy lover captured the twin star rain on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most of the stars that produce the meteor shower are the same as the zodiacal constellation, but the mother planet of the Geminid meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid of the Abradovich type.
The other known example of a binary asteroid is the second-known binary system that is not produced by the "pregnant" asteroid Vesta.
Peng Shuxie, an astronomer of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert of astronomy popularization, said that just like the Geminids, the shower of double stars usually appears at the end of life. The "show window" may last from December 4 to 17.
The stream of stars is called a "tightly-packed star rain" with a large flow rate and stable performance, and is also known as one of the three major star rains in the northern hemisphere together with the Geminid meteor shower and the Leonid meteor shower.
A distinctive feature of double-star rain is that the stars are slow moving, rich in color, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for beginners in astronomy to observe with eyes and take pictures with camera.
Tianjin astronomy lover Yang Jing took the photographs of the double rainbow in the sky in Tianjin Boliang District on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical almanac shows that the annual meteor shower will reach the peak around 15:00 on December 14. The ZHR (the number of stars seen per hour in ideal observation conditions, with the radiation point located just above the head) will be 150.
A graph showing the number of double-star planets that have been discovered.
Last year's double-whammy of a meteor shower, the Leonids, left a lasting impression, but this year's shower will be slightly diminished by the glare of the full moon.
On November 11 of the lunar calendar, it was the 11th day of the 11th month, and there was a full moon in the sky. The bright moonlight would have interfered with the observation, but the moon would have set in the late night, and the radiation of the double-star rain would have been relatively high at that time.
Your friends who love star rain may observe it in the hours after the midnight of the full moon, but they should keep warm and prevent from getting cold. "
How can we observe more stars?
“It is not advisable to observe the moon in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, a clear sky, and a view to the northeast, and then wait patiently until the moon rises, and then observe the moon by aiming your eyes.”
It is necessary to pay attention that the flow of double-star rain in all directions is very large. So we should not always watch the double-star rain point.
If you are a friend who loves photography and want to take pictures of the beautiful "stars and rain", you'd better choose a wide angle and a large aperture lens to shoot, and use a high ISO and the largest aperture when shooting.
In consideration of stability and durability, the three-wheeled vehicle, the battery and the fast charger must also be prepared in abundance. "
Peng told Reuters.
What are the differences between the market positioning of laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV set referred to by the topic author should be the liquid crystal TV. The difference between the market positioning of the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV lies in the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses on the large-screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of the full-screen liquid crystal TV, the focus of laser TV is clearly the large-screen market, that is, laser TV itself is a product for large screens.\n\n### Input:\n相比液晶电视全面铺开的市场定位，激光电视显然更聚焦大屏市场，或者说激光电视本身就是为大屏而生的产品。\n\n### Output:\nCompared to the market positioning of the full-screen liquid crystal TV, the focus of laser TV is clearly the large-screen market, that is, laser TV itself is a product for large screens.
At present, the mainstream of LCD TV size is 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of plasma TV is generally above 75 inches, which exceeds 100 inches in some cases, thus fully meeting user's demand for a large screen LCD TV.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales volume of laser TVs have continued to increase, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV shipments and sales.
According to Pellkofer’s prediction, the market sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140% in 2020, maintaining a high growth rate.
The good performance of the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of plasma TVs in the area of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television, the light rays emitted by the laser light source are not straight, but come into the eye at an angle, compared with the backlight source of LCD TVs. The imaging process is closer to the imaging process under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Shanghai Institute of Standardization Research of China’s Electronic Technology and the ophthalmology experts from Beijing Eye and Ear Hospital, after conducting a strict comparison test under the same conditions for people watching the laser TV and LCD TV, obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms: laser TVs do have very strong glare protection, and in certain aspects, they even have certain improvement.
In the current era of increasing vision health, laser TV, which boasts the advantages of protective glasses, has attracted an increasing number of users. It also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continued decline in the price of LCD TVs, the price of market-sold laser TVs is generally above RMB 1,000. As size and light source upgrade, the price gradually increased.
What gives Panasonic's OLED TV the high price tag?
That's reasonable.
Under the continued development of light sources and technologies, the advantages of laser TVs and projectors that liquid crystal TVs and conventional projectors cannot achieve are emerging.
Using ultra short throw lens technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively short compared to that of traditional projection devices. It can realize a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, and the space required is small, and the host is small and compact, taking up a small footprint.
In terms of brightness, the large brand LED TVs can reach a level of 2000 or more.
This is in addition to the fact that the power consumption is low, the equipment is durable, and the life of the TV is also extended.
In addition, many high-end LED TV models also carry 4K ultra high definition pictures, artificial intelligence systems, virtual screens and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring a more shocking viewing experience to users.
We are not talking about the demand for fake products, but the demand for differentiated products. The discussion is about the quality of the animation and the input and output ratio. The laser TV is not a menu for film and TV fans. If you want to enjoy the big screen and watch the environment is not satisfactory, you can try. All things have advantages and disadvantages, and you can judge by weighing them afterward. After all, it is your own judgment.
To put it simply, the ultra-wide angle lens is close to the subject - the laser TV, so we have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors to get the job done. This does not conform to the best optical design.
To block out some of the environmental light, the use of Flexible OLED panels with a micro-structure is expensive, with a price tag of approximately RMB 80 for a 65-inch screen.
Another thing I particularly dislike is the reflection of the cinema owner on the eye. I mean, how can the light on the screen, which is in front of the eye, be considered as a straight light to the eye? You may think that the light is reflected to the ceiling, but the eye cannot see it. In other words, the liquid crystal TV is also "straight", and the TV screen is not bright, is it?
And if the projection screen is not a mirror, it doesn’t become a thing at all.
This is because the high-energy peak of the sun's radiation is often ignored, and only the UV component is considered. In reality, a lot of ultraviolet light is reflected back, making it difficult to bear.
WVS Photo Art Gallery chooses quality rather than quantity as its store concept, and there are no plans to divide the store at present.
Added the WeChat appointment date, she sent me the time schedule of the available time, and replied information is quite prompt.
I watched the video works in the store before, and most of them were outdoor wedding dresses. The photos were very beautiful, and the shooting style involved was also very much.
We simply exchanged our ideas with each other after that, and she was very patient to help me try on two styles of my own dresses. We finally settled on the makeup style and the photographer set up the props before shooting. He would direct the action and pay great attention to detail for each aspect.
But possibly because I didn't exchange specific shooting ideas with him, the style he shot wasn't what I had in mind, but it was good to look 🙂 🙂
After taking photos, the photographer helped me choose the pictures, and we exchanged contact information. We felt that it was quite meaningful to be able to communicate with the people in the pictures afterward.
The film will be finished in about half a month, with the same effect.
The second time around, there was a photo-shoot style live broadcast, where most of the clothing items were selected for shooting.
For the final look, she chose a black wool dress that felt quite different to the other styles she'd tried on.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting was a young master who was born in 1995. I felt a little bit out of touch. I hope to be able to give more suggestions on the basis of the customer's shooting action in the future. The shooting process was relatively fast.
WVS Photo Art Gallery selected high-quality store. Reply
Came to the home page, also want to take a look at Queenie bar.
I filled in my name and contact number at the store before trying on clothes, and then chose my wedding suit. I tried on several suits, but I was so picky that I almost wore my suit after a long time. I chose one and got dressed, and the service attitude was also good. You can watch the video to learn how to pose for photos. It feels like I have no differences with the original actor. It has been half a month since I started to grow my hair. I feel like I have no differences with the original actor.
【Environment】As a whole, it is still in good condition.
There are many options for the coat.
There are only three makeup stands, with a photobooth in between.
【Service】very enthusiastic, also very attentive.
And surgeons are tough.
And the photographer will also carefully teach you how to act.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also actively offer compensation.
【Experience】A bit of a transformation, the original double eyelid now has three eyelids.
Eyebrows were also shaved off, which was a bit embarrassing for people who don’t wear makeup.
After 10 days, the photos were not satisfactory, and I felt that the double-eyelid surgery was very obvious.
Because she didn't know what style to choose, she tried two styles. But in the end, she chose the black suit. The girl said that this set was relatively close to the vintage style of the 1950s.
chose the clothes and started to do makeup afterward. The stylists and makeup artists were super patient with me while I tried on different outfits. I was very satisfied with the results.
I did my makeup and then started taking photos. The photographer gave me instructions throughout the shoot, and it was very easy and pleasant.
I carefully picked out four of my favorite shots after I finished shooting. My little brother said that he was 15 years old. I’m very satisfied with the outcome.
I have not received a reply for 3 days......Since your system cannot identify my credit card, I cannot subscribe to the #PRS_ORG# plus membership plan!
The strangest thing was that I used the same credit card every time I paid.
Now I am always paying the shipping fee.
Can I have my salary in advance, and then you can investigate and deduct it from my salary next month?
Should I buy insurance for my umbrella?
Xiaoyu is a online insurance distribution platform.
From the perspective of setting up conditions: According to the "Insurance Law of People’s Republic of China (Amended and Supplemented in 2015)", a person who meets the following three key words shall be qualified to establish an insurance company: shareholders, founders and recent three years have no major violations, with a minimum registered capital of 50 million yuan, and must be approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three are very difficult. The conclusion is that it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the state authority department of the insurance regulator (the regulator of the insurance companies and banks in China) and the shareholders to have a good reputation, to act as a small umbrella insurance of the insurance company, and the depositor is not required to have any doubts about whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not. After all, there are three gates for the insurance company to pass. It is impossible for any insurance company to achieve this.
There's still a long way to go on this, but it's encouraging and it's worth being trusted.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyu roof insurance is a supermarket of insurance, and many companies' star risks are sold on this platform. For example, the latest listed and super-top Maruti 5-seater is sold on this platform. Both the plaintiff and the surety are Thais. Xiaoyu roof insurance is just an intermediary third party. There is no reason to doubt its credibility.
From the perspective of the payment model: Internet platform products, because it has fewer operating costs of business nodes, and the cost of business staff, so Internet product prices are generally higher than that of traditional products. And the payment method is flexible, supports monthly payments, reduces the payment pressure on policyholders, and can maximize the stimulation of the insurance industry at the same time.
This is also very good.
It's an idea to consider.
From the perspective of professional qualifications: this is particularly important because insurance is a very professional demanding industry. Many Internet product customers may themselves apply for insurance. This would exist a lot of misjudgment, especially in the areas of health knowledge and professional ethics. The non-insurance personnel usually add their subjective ideas while applying for insurance. They may feel healthy or meet the requirements while applying for insurance. However, this may easily lead to a lot of risks of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance sales over the phone for “Tencent Weibo” (a social media platform similar to Twitter), and would like to tell everyone that it is very responsible work.
Insurance for the Internet is real, but it is also risky. The riskiest part is not the Internet channels, but people. Internet channels do not have professional staff, which leads to many misconducts.
For example, a 1 yuan insurance protects up to 6 million, and if you buy insurance, you can get 60,000 yuan of free medical treatment. These market strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy part and will not tell the insured that the first month is free, but the subscription fee is needed in the following months, which is 20 to 200 yuan higher than that of normal fees. Many customers have deducted the fees they bought for themselves for a year or two, but it is not clear whether they know it or not.
The insurance company paid 6 million yuan (US$880,000) in compensation because the customer thought he could buy a house with the 100,000 yuan.
Free mobile phone was sent with a special serial number segment, such as 6666, 8888, etc. Only these special serial number segments were sent. And if the short message was sent, it would not be exchanged, and no one would be informed.
For the depositor, it is another trick. The free insurance of 60,000 yuan is short term, if it only relies on this insurance, which is not commercial risk, and if the problem is serious, the 60,000 yuan can just solve the problem temporarily, and then comes the life of wandering.
At present, the country is also severely attacking the misconceptions of Internet insurance sales.
So, in general, the platform is not the problem, nor is the product. The problem lies in the professionalism and the professional ethics of the business staff.
The suggestions should be comprehensively considered in light of the fact that many offline insurance companies have a wider range of products and the opportunities and products available to customers are more diverse. Some of the products are also more cost effective than those online.
I have helped 59 Internet customers and secured offline products for them. The insurance cost each person between RMB 2,000 and RMB 3,000 per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I: I’m a general manager of a insurance company with more than 3 years of enterprise management training experience, having served more than 1000 enterprise users, and cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before the insurance, I would start from the customer's demand and customize the insurance products for the customers. During the insurance, I would help the customers to choose the best protection ratio among three insurance companies. After the insurance, I would do the insurance registration and settlement for the customers, and manage and supervise the insurance policies for the customers. In this way, the customers can feel at ease without worries.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer helps the topic owner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulation department, the Internet insurance is a kind of insurance business which can finish all the insurance processes of the insured through clicking on the insurance link.
During this process, the depositor does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All the steps can be done by the depositor themselves.
Although the insurance of the Internet does not have the "ceremonial sense", and even the printed paper contract may not have, but this does not affect the validity and legal force of the electronic contract.
It is a bit like the old "tele-marketing" model of sales, but with insurance purchases it is a bit of a fatal flaw that the service offered may not be followed through."
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for years, and when we buy insurance, we should think carefully whether this "intermediary" we have chosen is a "life insurance intermediary" that can stay with us for many years and provide services after many years.
So how am I supposed to contact the food delivery staff?
It's already 3 o'clock.
Do I get compensation?
I said, “Door-to-door delivery”.
But the rider just threw it in the doorway and walked off."
Also, the government sent a convoy of 200 vehicles to evacuate people from the city.
Your jockey has already taken me out to dinner, but I'm still waiting for my check.
The rider had received my offer at 19:25, but still did not start.
I've bought everything, do you need anything else?
What are the chances?
Where is your rider going?
Wait one minute?
I am sending a single.
Good, you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food would be subject to safety and health problems.

Vietnam News - Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc is attending the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
Two major meetings were held during the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum to discuss topics surrounding digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and the novel coronavirus epidemic and economic recovery and development.
Minister of Communications, Ruan Mengxiong said that in 2021, although the number of new coronavirus cases continued to spread, the number of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam and their business revenue still maintained a growth trend of nearly 10%.
By 2021, Vietnam will see a boom in digital products, with efforts focused on solving Vietnam’s major problems, and many digital products have gone abroad; Vietnam’s digital technology ranking has improved.
Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology enterprises to assume the responsibility for developing digital transformation platforms in developing countries, and said that developing these digital transformation platforms for these countries is a mission for the country.
At the forum, leaders of departments and agencies of various countries and organizations are sharing their motivations and experiences in studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises and organizations and to jointly promote the digital transformation of the country, as well as breakthrough ideas and solutions for economic recovery after the Zhu Hisheng situation.
When delivering a speech at the forum, Premier Li Keqiang stressed that digital transformation is a prerequisite for global development and an objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services must involve the entire citizenry.

Three US aircraft carriers gathered around China. It is rare to have the strongest weapon visiting the Qingdao. 2022-01-17 Multivision Multimedia Inc. Multivision reports: The latest news on the China-U.S. relation: the latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers were gathering around China; the U.S. media also leaked that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy was rare to visiting Qingdao, and it would send an important signal to American allies and foes in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the information from China's think tank, "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform", on January 9th, the US Navy's "Gerald R. Ford" aircraft carrier was found near the Balabak Strait.
The Strait of Bab el-Mandeb connects the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, and is a strategic location in the First Island Chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This was the first time that the "California" aircraft carrier deployed F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Osprey" tiltrotor aircraft.
The US Navy has two aircraft carriers now operating in the Pacific, apart from the USS Carl Vinson whose departure from the United States was announced on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" was also the first time to carry F-35C fighters. The 314th Fighter Squadron of the US Marine Corps is part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has another one, the "Ronald Reagan" class, stationed in the Asia-Pacific region. This class of aircraft carrier is based in Yokosuka, Japan.

Three US aircraft carriers gathered around China. It is rare to have the strongest weapon to visit the Qingdao. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
((Microblogging@South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness)) - The three US aircraft carriers are gathered around China. It is rare to have the strongest weapon for a visit to Jeju Island. The CMV-22B flight route of the US military on January 17, 2022.
((Microblogging@South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness)) According to a January 17 report on CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy was rare visited Jeju last weekend.
The Russian nuclear submarine "Severodvinsk" which carried 20 Trident missile and several dozen nuclear warheads entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
Three US aircraft carriers gathered for the first time around China. It is rare to see the most powerful weapon visiting the Qingdao. Analysis says that this is a signal sent to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation of India-Pacific region.
This is the first time for the US submarine to visit Jeju since 2016, and the second time for it to have a public visit to Jeju since the 1980s.

WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton posts about the recent drop of 26% in Meta's share price, which has a market value of $251 billion. Why?
Meta (original Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its income mainly comes from advertising. Today, it is a company that makes money from advertising, and has a flow of channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and other functions, no matter what the positioning, are Meta's flow channels.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many of the ads outside the App that are connected to Meta are achieved through the advertising platform of Meta.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's private policy, it is very difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertisements.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly notify users whether the App is allowed to obtain its information. The normal response of most people is to deny permission.
Google could further ratchet up the pressure on metas if it decides to make another move.
Second, the factor of China in the growth of Meta's income has weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it really exists).
In general, most people know that Meta does not have business in China. But this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's income every year comes from China, mainly from the contribution of Chinese companies engaged in maritime business.
In Hong Kong, Meta has a few hundred staff in its office, and there are several big agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is the unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money spent on advertising went to Meta.
It means that the TT of the present meaningful is one of the major competitors of Meta, but Meta earns a lot from Bitcoin for the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping each other to post the advertisement on the Meta. The performance of the Meta region is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into this recently, but things are definitely not as good as they used to be.
The stage for Chinese companies to raise large amounts of money overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels is unsuccessful.
Facebook is increasingly old-fashioned. Its new platform, which includes TT, is not in Meta’s hands.
The biggest problem is not only the income decline, but also the lack of growth expectation.
The capital market doesn’t just consider current income, but also looks at future expectations.
It is clear that Meta's expectations were too low.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the “Universe”.
Yu Yutopia should be one of the directions of the future, but the realization period of Yu Yutopia is relatively long. This story should not be able to support the valuation of Meta within a few years.
So, it should be a tough two years ahead for Meta.
Do not look now, but Facebook is in a very bad place, with up to $20 billion in revenue expected to be lost this year alone, and a crisis of confidence that puts it in a similar position to other internet companies and high-tech firms.
Although its several social software have now become popular, they are mainstream social software, such as Facebook and WhatsApp. But facing the rapid growth of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence at all, and the competition between them is merely a struggle for survival.
And for some reason, probably because it’s so improbable, it’s very dangerous to fall for it, which is why Facebook is very risky, and that’s why Zuckerberg changed the name of his company and is constantly on the look-out for new platforms - that was the fundamental reason - but I don’t think he made the right choice, it was a wrong turn. That's my thinking on it, for what it's worth.
