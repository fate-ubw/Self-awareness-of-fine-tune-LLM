Thank you in advance.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, stop fighting and our positions will be weak
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that fighting in eastern Ukraine, and in particular in Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian army is defeated there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and reoccupy the partially occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is the heart of this war today.
It's beating - we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city ‚Äì ed.) are people who attracted a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the eastern part of the state, in the OOS area, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these areas, we may not wait for the meeting.
Because at that time Russia will take all the steps that may lead to the return of even the occupied cities.
They may have to do that.
Then our position in the negotiations will be weaker and perhaps even uninteresting for the Russian side.
We regret to inform you.
We believe in our result, in our victory ..."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after torturing Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if they are in us".
Translation: "People will interpret the world in any way, because people want this war to end.
In our terms, the terms of Ukrainian independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we don't get emotional, war should end in peace or with millions of casualties.
And even there, where millions of victims, everything comes to an end with the war.
So we must fight - but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there is nothing, there are no people".
Good morning, do you have any free places left for the Czech course for adults starting at 19:00 on Tuesdays?

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state of Ukrainian literature.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian military personnel who took part in committing military crimes in the city of Bila Tserkva in the Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade, who are directly involved in committing military crimes against the Ukrainian people in the city of Bucha, the statement reads.
According to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, all war criminals who committed crimes against the peaceful population of Ukraine will be brought to justice.
The list can be viewed by clicking on the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from Russian occupiers.
Mass killings of civilians by Russian military forces have been documented in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, Mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the common grave.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed peaceful residents were evacuated from the territory of the Kiev region that was liberated from the Russian aggressors.

We promised that when you go to school we will surprise you.
Great, I have money for two months of rent, it doesn't matter where in Ostrava district, I would be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news about the cruel abuse of civilian population north of Kiev.
Photographs of beheaded and executed people shocked the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how such a thing could happen in the 21st century?! How?!
As for me, nothing surprised me. It was exactly what I was afraid of and expected...
I evacuated children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then he went back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine and have never for a moment doubted that my family would not be spared if the suburbs of Kyiv were occupied.
And I remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in the prison in the city of Zhitomir.
Several years ago, in the Zhytomyr branch of the Security Service of Ukraine, they gave a copy of the execution case of his grandfather: the whole case is over a hundred pages, but the sentence of death is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The defendants were illiterate, and they denied their guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, he had five children, was a free man, a poor "one-story" noble, never went to the peasants.
The fact that they lived in villages and had several cows was enough to condemn the peasants and nannies to death.
The relatives did not even learn of the location of the burial.
My grandmother said that at that time almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed, except for two who agreed to give false testimonies.
In the case of Karina, the surname of the striker is Shary.
Our former speaker of the parliament comes from a neighbouring village.
Believe in genetics and don't be surprised if his relative was a KGB informer.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as they say.
The firing squad that sentenced peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing his grandfather's case, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) informational resources in Russia, such as "The Eternal Barracks", which remind you of the events of those years.
Well, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost all those who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors in the 70s and 80s.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system initially discredited, then destroyed.
He was jailed for having child pornography on his computer and died in prison.
The KGB and its successors are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There concentrated the most abominable features of human nature.
Over the thousand-year-old tradition of the Golden Horde, slavery and imperial chauvinism were imposed from the 16th to the 19th centuries.
And then they did a genetic experiment on what came out of that, selectively breeding intelligence during several Red Terror waves.
Look at the semi-French film "The Lives of Others" from 1992, that's how it was.

The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, primarily for mercenary, commercial purposes.
And for me the problem is that if I don't love a person, nothing will come of it.
So we took her home and took her straight to the hospital.

It is possible that children will come to Val and play in the yard.

According to the European Truth, as reported by Welt with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles,
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training package and spares, is ‚Ç¨170 million.
Also proposed are howitzers in the version for the Boxer armoured vehicle for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire over a distance of more than 30 kilometres.
According to Ukrainian government circles, as reported by the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out on a circular basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its cannons in the shortest possible time, and the gaps created will be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers could be delivered within 30 months of the contract being signed, that is by the end of the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
So, are we doing this in the morning or the afternoon?
Thank you, we will find a way to replenish the ranks and strengthen them. I will write to you. Thank you.

Thank you very much for helping people. If you can, help us too. Find us affordable housing.
We are currently in Slap, staying with friends for the time being.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The husband has already found a job as a driver.
I am a masseur and a rehabilitation therapist looking for a job.
In order for the children to go to school and for me to work, we need housing that is not too far from civilization.
I simply had to give up today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.
Here's how to make golubtsy: In a pot, mix 0.5 liters of water with 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste until it boils.
Put the birds in a pot and pour the sauce over them.
It took about 1.5 hours to cook the turkey in the oven.
How much money do I have on this number?
I brought everything with me.
On Monday the 4th.
In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine will be able to ask for humanitarian aid at the new place of work of the Labour Office at the Prague market.
The branch in room No. 29 is designed to receive and process applications for assistance, so there is a translator on site.
Lidiya already went to school, but because of the illness we will go to the teacher on Tuesday, the teacher told me today.
I sit with headphones on, listening to music and thinking of you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, honey, how about you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I put it like this, that we are together. We are a pair.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
Therefore, I am not afraid that I will not find her there.
I know a lot of things.
Therefore, I am not afraid that I did not get into any of them.
Only don't know what will happen to my home.üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to get a food licence inspection. Can you do this for me?
Please be so kind as to help me prepare the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
Fifth place I understand in the room with a TV?
To dismantle and reupholster a sofa?
Can we stop at your place, while Ms. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about that.
It is not new, which we have already used, but it works, but it is not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, look at the map and see where it is from us
I don't know how much free space there is there, so I can't plan anything with furniture. I want to see the apartment this week so that I can understand which furniture I need.
Excuse me that I answered so long, it was a working day, hard to adapt
Is that all?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to be with you, to be able to hold you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you look.
There is a crib and a bathtub, things that I found at first
Don't forget what you promised to help me, as soon as you have the opportunity, but not the last to give ü§´üòüüòâüôÉ
I want to make a haircut called a cap.
Oleg is sick - cough and cold. Better not to bring Yana with us, so as not to catch it
I'll be a bit later - around 8. Is that okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
But I suffer, so that everything is good!?
We didn't even talk about that with these inquiries!
I understand how important this is to you!
As for myself, I keep quiet (for me this is just the peak I cannot reach)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ after the celebration?
Hello, excuse me, I just woke up, I slept badly
Think about that.
I was annoyed that we started the test badly yesterday with Kole.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yonashuk whether they can help me a little with mathematical concepts.
Can I be of any use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to study mathematical terms during the weekend.
Geometry is generally complicated, but we have to work with Kole so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We are also looking forward to it very much.
And so she is very happy to receive any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, on stop 402, I met a Ukrainian girl - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is all alone... her eyes full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't look away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl because it was the first person from Ukraine who felt my sincerity.
The branch in room 29 is intended specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance.
turned out that I had ordered a spare map
It's not worth it, I'm just a simple person.
So that she wouldn't be frightened that nobody came
I didn't go. I just sang. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving the city for a long time?
A year and a half ago in the Memorial Center of the Holocaust "Babi Yar" in Kyiv we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about the "common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and live in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This is also part of our responsibility, linked to our history.
If "the demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans there is only one answer: never again!"
The fight must go on."
Today Russia is attacking a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of peaceful residents, starving residents of blockaded cities to death, and giving them diseases to die from.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually reminiscent of the Babi Yar shootings.
For over a month the Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
So, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that were unimaginable not so long ago.
Germany Delays Delivery of Heavy Weapons Needed by Ukraine
But "Never Again!" means more than just standing up to swastikas.
This means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop atrocities occurring in Ukraine.
Give me one of your songs
We agree, organize the excursion, and write when we are gathered.
Everyone was sick except Lydia, who had a new strain of the virus
I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this stamp instead of a card
Whistle for late documents.
The ticket cost me the driver 2000 hryvnias
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were "for".
Following the Revolution of Dignity, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbass war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, while the number of its supporters grew.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainians - over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in wartime, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its member countries - for the inappropriate supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, reluctance to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a significant risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations to join NATO due to Russia's position, if this can stop the war and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military.
In a new episode of the podcast "Hard Questions," along with the editor of "European Truth," we talk about how the Alliance actually helped Ukraine from the moment of the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospects for membership in NATO are closer than ever in history, and why security guarantees, which are discussed in negotiations with Russia, can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think, that here
In me, the partner of 120 volts, it is indicated what my application for consideration is.
I sent it to her through this mobile app
We don't have visas, we have to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was organized in Poland, where they didn't give us visas, but gave us passports.
You'll be hearing from us!
Denis left today in a good mood.
He agreed to meet the boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, near the school so that he could show him everything.
So I hope everything is going well for him.
So I don't like it, I don't have enough time
The Czech Republic reportedly sent tanks T-72 and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine
I'm going to leave the children there and wait for 3-4 years and go back home because I can't leave.
And at 6 or 7 in the morning
There was a sick heart.
I had strong feelings for this guy but he wasn't very respectful and I dumped him.
After a while he came back and asked for my forgiveness.
I refused him.
He later called to say he had had a heart operation.
When I asked him to just talk to me, it became his downfall.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during this time.
At that time, I started to have problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual aid.
And I thought, perhaps it really is necessary to look at it in a different way.
And he proposed to me, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God decided our fate.
What does being 'ready to marry' mean for you?
He only speaks Czech
Wanted to say that I managed to find an apartment and I'm very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my child.
Did I mention this before?
Because I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which words you don't understand.
I myself understand that the translator does not always translate the text correctly.
Don't know how to talk to the doctor, or the paper she has to give?
Clearly the guests forgot, so I put it in the fridge
Perhaps it is time for you to go to sleep so that you can work tomorrow.
Can anyone help, I need things for a woman size XS or S height 165 cm and her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you.
That time in Lidl I bought two packs and my mum bought two
That's very kind of you, thank you.
It cheered me up
Well, let's talk about something else, because I'm not sleeping, I'm still sleeping and I'm dreaming that they're bombing...
God is never late, his own time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the value of unskilled labor, and I understand that such work as I had at home in Kiev I will not be able to have here, and the money I earned at home I will not be able to earn here now.
But I can't just sit and do nothing because then all the bad thoughts come into my head and I need to do something physical to distract myself.
Passports are processed at the airport from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., after that you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at about 4am.
So we took them in.
We slept in the kitchen with Vika, and they put us in the bedroom.
I finish work and go to the airport with them.

But I already found my place
Please be so kind as to invite Ukrainian children who will be entering the gymnasium.
Well, but I make it complicated.
Okay, write me when it's convenient üòò
I don't know yet. I would like to, of course, if I manage to get my children into kindergarten and school.
That was the plan. Better, that we sometimes changed our minds?
It's of no consequence to me. I really don't have any missed calls from the middle of the week. Excuse me, we'll reschedule for another time?
I am offering to clean the bathroom, including cleaning the toilet, washing three windows, and dusting.
Work around 3-4 hours. Sum of 800 grn one-time. From 19.04 Tuesday, from 2 pm.
I hope that I will tell you only that everything is well with us

Or can you write to your wife?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.

To be in the basin you need a permit
But this is my opinion
She got the rollerskates and the skating rink from my uncle's house. She used to skate on them at home.
I also woke up at 9 and am just now making breakfast
I'm very embarrassed to be talking to you on my day off. Hopefully I'm not too boring
We would like to inform you of a change of address and at the same time submit documents for the extension of your residence permit.

He is coming to visit you.
Please, be so kind as to provide me with an approximate schedule for cleaning your apartment for the next month, even if it's just a rough estimate of which days?
I just can't remember this schedule )
Russian army threatens to launch rocket attacks on Kiev: "Never done this before"
Direct words of Konashenkov: "We see attempts at diversion and attacks by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the RF.
If such cases continue, the Armed Forces of Russia will strike at the centers of decision-making, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army was previously restrained."
The Russians have been launching rocket attacks on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian occupational troops into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian anti-aircraft system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the suburbs of Kiev.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multi-storey building on Valeriya Lobanovsky Prospekt.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower near Babyn Yar in Dorogozhichi, as a result of which 5 passers-by were killed.
On March 2, Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems shot down Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building from the South Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a missile fired by the occupiers destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket struck a residential neighborhood in Vinnitsa, killing one person and injuring 19, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinnitsa, as a result of which at least 4 people were killed.
Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city should not yet return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket attacks on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition in the suburbs of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that Russia plans to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the RF in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1 near Belgrade in Russia, an oil base exploded, allegedly due to an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, local authorities in Belgrade announced that a "Ukrainian missile" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing cold water on the idea of the people's fighters shooting down Russian bombers over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and the general public.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of tens of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that no one of his predecessors managed to do.
Zelensky doesn't convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European nations that elect those politicians.
And these words, this refined blend of strength, tenderness and time, gradually reach their goal.
While Biden categorically opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's entry, the process is already underway.
I understand you, that's why I don't want to be considered a fraud.
Money you raise, give to those more in need.
I can come to you and we can sort it there. I'm here to help.
The air is clean, that's a plus üòÄ
There it says that I have a tariff "Together without internet", I asked for the internet instead.
I don't understand the terms and conditions
Do we have any premises today? Or, as always, only stairs going up and down?
And I'm already on my way by train.
But I won't stop loving you, you are everything for me.

He really helps people see what they're worth and what they have to offer.
If you don't need a price list, I won't give it to you.
Tell me how you want it, and I'll make it happen.
You don't want me to write to you today. Why?
Don't worry, I'm not asking for anything.
More precisely - today I ask for your attention.
I have a lot to say today, so please bear with me.
How are you doing?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, holidays.
You have a dream.
You're planning to buy that dress you saw at the mall yesterday.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain can't handle this.
He is clinging to the old reality.
If you call in sick, find out - are you coming in to work today, or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... this won't last long.
Now... they are negotiating... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? I have nobody and nowhere.
I had $50 in my pocket. Everything we spent at home.
Many of our bosses did not pay us our wages.
Where should I go? Who do I need? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't say much.
You don't take anything from home... to drive 1000 kilometers.
You don't know whether you'll have them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the children around Prague.
And what next? We don't know. How much? We don't know. The children ask for candy. But you can't. It's too expensive for you.
And with every potato sack - we don't have one.
Our choice is to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to save ourselves here.
She was very pleased with the children and the things they gave her when she came to school
You should have called me when you were coming.

So, I understand that this is very good.
Can you send me a photo of the lady you are learning English with?
Well, whatever you write tomorrow, we'll meet or not, possibly your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be so great to know someone from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you free tomorrow? Don't want to meet after 4pm?
What are your general impressions of the first week?
Karina brought us medicine yesterday and we are drinking it now.
I can work with bedridden patients and children with disabilities.

Please let me know how you will be traveling üôèüèª
Today we are happy - our city of Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, and our troops are advancing.
Cleaning up from the enemy - looking for Russians in cellars and apartments.
The entire city has been mined, and demining work will begin.
And Ivan looked and saw that there was work to be done,

Panas wants to stay at home, he says he is tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will bake pizza and do lessons.
These are small business owners who opened up their shops and offices to serve as volunteer hubs.
These are tractor drivers, who actually go out into the field under fire because it's time to plant.
That's the drivers of buses, who are agreeing today to travel in convoys to the occupied territories to bring in aid and take out people.
These heroic conductors drive trains into war zones, comfort and help refugees in carriages, and help volunteers load humanitarian aid onto trains at peace stations.
These petrol stations, which stood on the Kiev Highway in the first days of the war, patiently served scared and nervous people.
These communal workers collect rubbish during shelling, repair water pipes and power lines to ensure people have the necessary supplies.
These are doctors and nurses, who work 24 hours a day, never complaining, and in their free time volunteer, collecting medicine for the front.
In Ukraine, it's no longer a secret when little kids write on the walls

My daughter is 8 years old, is this a suitable age?
I am looking for accommodation for us and our daughter for 3-4 days when we come to Czech Republic to deliver passports for visa application to Canada.
In Warsaw there are a lot of people at the coach station and the on-line queue is not working.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, the journey by train takes a long time, and it will be hard for the child.
So she decided to look for accommodation in Prague or close to it.
No, we like it
Yesterday's devices are

The Czech Republic started issuing visas after 22 March, as far as I know.
Until that time - they stamped these and then equated these stamps to visas
Ukrainian Overseas Electoral District (UOED) - an electoral district that includes electoral precincts located outside Ukraine and consists of premises for voting in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and premises on Ukrainian military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed in Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.[1] The role of the district election commission for the Ukrainian Overseas Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only national elections are held in the Overseas Voting District: presidential and parliamentary elections and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not being held.

I wanted to say that I have already connected my Czech mobile number.
I didn't need any other device, I went to the operator O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need any other device.
Thank you. I am very uncomfortable, work on Sundays and already can't
You said that your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. You need it too.

Well, after Easter
Did your mum tell you yesterday that something was hurting you?
She can't tell them everything she wants to, and she doesn't understand everything they're saying (but she came in yesterday in a great mood after that market.
I also went to school today.
Today I saw Christina's mum but she didn't even acknowledge me
Those apples are very tasty, what kind are they?
The head of the presidential administration, Andrei Yermak, said that Russia has begun a "fake operation" regarding weapons that our allies are passing on to us.
The direct words of Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and strive to "cut off" supplies of arms by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes - namely, the destruction of the S-300 missile systems transferred to Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will happen next? We know scenarios of Russians. Name one of them.
They are spreading fake news that Ukrainian soldiers are actually taking weapons from their allies and massively switching to the Russian army.
I want to put a stop to this nonsense right now.
And weapons in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Please excuse me, I forgot to ask how much the daycare costs per month and if it will be open during the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage at evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the claims as "propaganda."
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4 that "messages about Russian troops killing, raping and severely injuring Ukrainian peaceful residents deserve condemnation."
Russia needs to answer to the world for what they've done, she added, noting her administration would discuss additional steps to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports that hundreds of peaceful residents were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets of the suburb of Kyiv, Bitch, by Russian troops who had left the area after occupying it for several weeks.
Photos purportedly showing the bodies of civilian victims with their hands tied behind their backs shocked many and prompted calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in an April 4 radio interview that there were signs that Russian forces committed "war crimes" in Beslan.
What happened in Bucharest requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures, Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go as far as committing "genocide" in Bujumbura.
We will spare no effort to ensure that those responsible for these war crimes will not go unpunished, said Sanchez in Madrid.
Addressing state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as "propaganda."
She made the claim without providing evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first few minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story, Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also made unsubstantiated claims that the images of Bukchy were "another attempt by the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the U.N. Security Council to meet April 4 to discuss what it called "the provocative actions of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Russian Investigative Committee published a statement announcing the "investigation" on charges of disseminating Ukrainian "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 3 accused Russian forces of committing a "genocide" in the city and told the Kremlin leaders they would have to travel to Bucha to see what their military had done.
I want all the Russian Federation leaders to see how their orders are executed, Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
It is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head, he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for actions in Ukraine.
When I see people with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads cut off, I don't understand, he said of scenes of victims lying in the streets of Bucha, a town about 35km northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent for the Ukrainian Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty saw bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town on April 2.
In one place the correspondent saw 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw bodies of at least 21 people in different locations in Bujumbura.
The bodies of nine people, all civilians, were scattered across the ground near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at close range.
Ukrainian authorities have said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in the area around Kiev, which was under Russian control last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
They were told: "Kiev is not there". How occupiers cynically transported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is another point in this list, about which there is much less information now - the evacuation of local population to the territory of the enemy.
Around mid-March, Russian occupiers "evacuate" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements on their territory and in Belarus, which the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko effectively gave over to a Russian military polygon.
"Ukrayinska Pravda" found deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the very "evacuation" is going on and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary evacuation out of Ukraine under psychological pressure and desperation.
Thankfully, they are alive and in contact with their families.
However, given the statements of Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strong pressure.
In Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped personnel from the second maternity hospital, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Yosip Zapchynsky.
Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true adventurers, Denis and Marina had prepared three backpacks in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses were already full.
Around midday on February 24, they saw helicopters with the letter V on them, followed by the first shells.
One of them struck a neighbouring building.
Then the family went downstairs and stayed there for a long three weeks until March 17 when the Russian military came and took them to Belarus.
In total, around 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
On the evening of the 24th of February, people came to the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
Feeding: "Who?" - I say that. - "Get out!"
They searched me, patted me down, asked who was in the basement, if there was any weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
Women were told: "We came to protect you at the request of Ramzan Kadyrov.
It was a Chechen OMON, even not soldiers, young men aged 25-35.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, and now we came to help you".
On the third day they asked what we needed.
We say that water was a big problem.
They smashed the shop, took the goods out under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway", and brought us six bottles.
There is also footage on the internet of children thanking Kadyrov for food.
So they took the meat from the shop after robbing it and said: "We know this is wrong but we really need the video for Ramzan Ahmatovich".
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful montage.
Our child is saying: "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly distinguished themselves from the Russians.
They said that it was good that they came, because they themselves did not want war, they support Ukrainians and are good people: "Putin is a monster, and so is Kadyrov, but we can do nothing, because our families are there".
And mostly they didn't fight, they looted shops, robbed.
They brought me a crow, tied a Georgian ribbon to one leg and a white scarf to the other and called it a "volunteer".
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so badly that they didn't even take the bodies, they asked us: "What do you have, artillery?"
Moreover, there were formed detachments - Chechens among themselves did not know each other, in the first days they asked passwords to find out whether they were their own or not.
They were here until the 13th of March, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Moscow paratroopers.
They put 30-40 units of machinery between the houses - and we kept falling into it from the "Baikatirs".
But they came and told us that the ZSU no longer exists, but there is the "Azov" and, according to their words, the "Azov" is 1000 in Ukraine.
The narrative that "Kiev has already surrendered" has been circulating since the beginning of March.
Once upon a time a Russian - either a paratrooper or a representative of the FSB - came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - there was talk of Bucha, Hostomel, and we thought they might give us the "green corridor".
From the very beginning we gave the Chechens our lists, and they promised to get in touch with the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are being taken to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov".
We are saying we don't want to go there, we don't want to go there.
They responded: "That's a load of rubbish!"
How it worked: They would herd us into the basement and start shooting from under the house - whether it was with grenades or mortars.
And then it came back... The neighbouring houses just burnt down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor of our house.
They later agreed to take us to Belarus, promising to pass us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some didn't go, saying it was for traitors of the motherland - that "they'll shoot you there, sell your organs".
We were driven through Chernobyl, and on both sides of the road there were piles of firewood, broken machinery, although the Belarussians told us that the Russians take the machinery away from them immediately.
There are a lot of cannons, buried technology and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised control, many people were without documents because they had burned.
We were put up in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear gunfire! A rocket is fired and you can see the trail - it was an "Iskander" missile fired at Kiev.
While the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, they are flying, turning at the border".
But we are aviation, we have education, we understand that.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His boss, Hungarian Vasyl Stepanovych, says: "Here I am, from Chernivtsi.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves are caught.
The poor suffer!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
He will do what he says."
They offered an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one was interested.
The sanatorium administration told us: "You are traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least that's what they called themselves) were spreading disinformation that men were not allowed to travel to Poland.
Many believed it and left Belarus.
But we decided to go anyway, although we had a problem with documents - our daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We had him on Monday, and by Thursday we were at war.
The Ukrainian consulate was of no help to us, and in Minsk at the train station they told us that no one will get into a bus without a passport.
Here I want to say that the Belarusian volunteers helped us very much.
We were settled in Minsk, and the support was provided.
He was not being held in the sanatorium against his will.
Our second group of migrants was told that they could stay for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, and there are no benefits here.
We found an internal courier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving by Mizhirya (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UA), we saw launches of ballistic missiles over Ukraine: the rocket takes off, glows beautifully, and then fades away.
People getting on the bus in Minsk said that Russians there are constantly shooting from firing ranges.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are leaving the army.
One woman told us that if her son was called she would break something.
However, the north of Belarus, where Minsk is, generally do not believe.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful people".
They do not accept that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland we are waiting for friends who will take us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, we are deciding what to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, probably, as many as the Estonian ones.
Marina was living in a military camp in Gostomel with her family - her brother's wife and two children aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighbouring house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and in principle will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the centre you won't be able to ?
Thank you, everything is with us. And guests are always waiting for you!
Thank you for the agreement, we are happy
And in this little flat there is no wi-fi, mainly because all your questions I answer myself and now I don't know how to be?And the children have online classes on Monday and there is no internet.
So I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
In the Koran it is written: "Even a leaf falls from a tree with its knowledge."
Our children are taught online. I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can work as a farmer or a cleaner, that is, a multitasker. Mariya is a specialist in growing vegetables, she can work at home, and the second Mariya has no specialty, that is, a multitasker.
How to do it better?
On April 1, the mayor of Bila Tserkva, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced good news - Ukrainian soldiers freed the city from Russian occupiers on March 31.
The occupiers threw them out of the whole of the Kyiv region the next day.
However, the joy that Ukrainians would have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was also learned at that time that in just one city of Bitch, at least 280 peaceful residents were shot by the Russians.
They were just killed on the street, hands were tied and they were shot in the head, some of the killed were minors.
The bodies of Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and their son Alexander, who were abducted on 23 March, were found with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were found in a common grave, while Igor was found in a sewer.
Bodies of several naked women, wrapped in blankets, were found by the roadside 20km from Kiev.
The Russians tried to burn them down.
And if I go, there will be nobody at home
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday I was supposed to have it delivered, but no one contacted me and it was not delivered, and on the DHL website it said that the recipient could not be found.
Therefore, it was sent to the post and the address of this department was indicated.
How do I get it?
I was also able to go to the river every day a few times a day when I was little. The river was right by the house, just a few steps away. But now I rarely go, there's no time, and sometimes I don't even want to. I only go with my sister) :)

Good morning, so interesting work, but we don't speak Czech.
To whom can we give things to do?
The charitable organization Archiepiscopal Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, specifically in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine, Russian men are raping women, their children forced to watch.
Then they can rape, mutilate the body and the children see that.
Good morning, I'm chatting with you - I need to learn Czech, but I can't tear myself away from the news.
I think about you a lot. I feel like you can hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European truth".
All the equipment, all that they have sent, for some types of equipment this has been done too late.
So, when we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, that's really true.
Some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the cost of these changes," he said.
Asked if Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "No, no."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would not have been this war, or it would have taken a different form.
It would have developed differently, we would have had the support of our neighbours, we could have fought together.
But I am confident that there would not have been a war," he added.
We recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military aid, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream of ending the war and returning home
Please write me about all that will be necessary, if you please.
I wanted to ask you where the blender came from in our kitchen
Destructive actions in the form of spreading hoaxes and disinformation are aimed at provoking panic and disorganization, which are sensitive to public safety.

We went to this address to ask about some school papers that we needed, but we didn't get there.
And the mother's prayer is the most powerful.
I hear a lot - war on 10% of Ukrainian territory.
Why do people run?
Why don't they live on the territory where there is no war?
Are you in your right mind?
Did you live in a war-torn country?
When prices rose by 100-200%.
When the majority of enterprises are NOT WORKING.
When there is no work.
When children hear gunfire?
You lived like that?
You can't even imagine.
God forbid.
If you must know - it was a disaster.
So we run.
Some of us are disoriented, with phones... from our other life... so, some of us haven't adapted in a month.
And you will be able to adapt within a month.
So the state gives us 5000 crowns.
Will you be able to live on this money?
Many foundations give food.
Have you tried taking the metro with children in the fund?
If you're looking for food in one place, clothes in another, and time to travel is running out.
And tomorrow we will go again... because the food they gave us is enough for a day.

You come to the Town Hall, and at the reception desk you say you are looking for Ms. Krzkowska, if they do not tell you the way and the number of the door to her.
This will be written on his door, says the department head.
If you can't come to an agreement, call Dominic, but I think it will all work out.
If Ms. Krzkowska is not coming, wait for her minute, she said, adding that she had a meeting, so she might be a bit late, but she knows about you, she booked you for this 9 a.m. appointment specifically so that you could get to the doctor on time.

I didn't even touch the door, but it rang.
If I understand the boss right, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on some days for as many hours as I want, as long as I get paid.
If that is the case, then I will be able to, for example, work a few hours a day for a few days a week.
For how many hours a day and on which days will I be looking at how it will be for me, so that I can go to work and earn money for the apartment cleaning, where they pay more for the cleaning than for the work.
As a technologist of water supply, I can feel the smell of water immediately.

Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
Just now I received a call from a woman from Damirlo and she said that they threw me an e-mail with further actions, but I did not respond.
She spoke Czech and I understood her.

There are also many nuances for men
He was a very wealthy man, but I liked him because he had his own point of view on life. I met him, then went away from him.
He was a very wealthy man, and a few months later he called to say that he had had a heart transplant.
Asking me to just talk to him and support him, it became his downfall.
He was a very wealthy man and he thought he could buy me off and he could buy my silence.
And then he made me an offer
There was a machine in my backyard that looked like a crocodile and was spewing fire.
And they kept me in the house, then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400, and there was no air to breathe.
As for housing, which you photographed and threw away

I'm not greedy for anything
I understand that I cannot sit with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and Ukrainian TV in general.
I see all the news on the internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propaganda channel, it's not interesting for me at all.

I tell her that "television and radio repairs" have been dragged out by imported parts, and that friends and acquaintances have been warned not to blow a fuse when phoning.
For a whole month we hid the news of the war from our grandmother.
So far, so good.
However, in Plymki (kitten - UP), the fur on the tail and hocks is shedding - this may be due to stress, changes in diet and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress from me does not depend, unfortunately.
Plamka, unlike the grandmother, is not deaf, she can hear the sirens and explosions".
Because Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her niece lived with her "incognito" for a month.
On April 1, 1993, 93-year-old Oksana Polova picked up a weapon for the first time in her life.
For 33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
From her they hid the war, and the fact that I was there - she came for a few hours formally.
But when her sister started talking, I gave her the receiver - she listened for four hours, then sang for two."
The radio was always by the bed.
Most of the time, the grandmother spends in her room.
Hearing poorly allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard her heels, I'd hide in my room.
Firstly, she hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone she knew. Six or seven people.
She asked him to talk to her about anything but war.
I asked my girlfriend, she was there from the start and to the end
April 17 is the day when I clean two apartments :)

I'm telling you right here,
Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian army says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British serviceman with the Ukrainian Marine Corps, which is defending Mariupol, has told his friends and family that they should lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of British serviceman Aiden Aslin, who has been serving with the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2018, with reference to members of Aslin's family and friends, and Atlas News with reference to a friend of Aslin who spoke to him
Twitter Elinson: "We got a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we tried everything to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army.
We haven't run out of food and ammunition.
Thank you everyone, hope the war will finish soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th Marine Infantry Battalion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is taking part in the Mariupol defensive operation.
Journalists with the BBC spoke to Lt Col Wood's mother, who confirmed her son had phoned to say they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the soldier, Lt. Col. Brian Foley, also confirmed to reporters that in their last phone call, Iselin discussed plans for their unit's surrender.
According to his words, the brigade is out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from the Atlas News outlet contacted his friend, who said that the Eislins' unit intended to surrender to Russian units so as not to fall into the hands of so-called "Kadyrovtsy" militants without weapons and ammunition.
Social media also spread an audio recording of a telephone conversation, in which it was claimed that Eislin was talking to his American friend, who was planning to travel to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eslan said they tried to leave the city in civilian clothes but were unsuccessful.
Earlier, the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eslam was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but travelled to Syria in 2015 to 2017 to fight against the so-called Islamic State.
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and took an oath.
His friends and family called him John, but online he was better known by his nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I also want to know. Are we together or not.
But that won't be easy, you'll have to find him...
You offered to take me with you, and I agreed if everything was going to be okay
Thank you, it is not necessary yet, you have done so much for us, we are very grateful to you.
If you do not want me to write, I will wait.

One brother is at war in Mariupol, the second is in Zaporizhia, and the husband was transferred from Kiev to Kharkov today.
Talking on the phone every day saying that everything is fine, but there is someone who knows, and they are not telling the truth
"I would like to come to you, but there are some things I need to take care of first."
I ask the man in the morning if he will be ready tomorrow.
When you come home, write me, please, if you need to talk to Daniel.
The Bolshevik attackers made full use of their losses in the battle.
Teacher Dmitry Pavlichuk, his unknown relative by name, and young Boris Alexienko were shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit, covered with earth".
According to memories, "there was a dead silence in the city".
Sometimes someone from among the residents would wander from house to house.
Bodies of those killed by the Bolsheviks were constantly found on the streets
And I, maybe, and really go with you. You need me. I can't do without you.
3. What is your own activity/activity that would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't make it, because the reconstruction of the railway and the parking lot is closed.
If you get to the bridge that is being reconstructed, tell me and I will come to you.
A bright future awaits us
Things that don't fit us in size, give them to you or Kati

I'm not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can work physically.
When you can bring things.
Tradition is very interesting in your country, we celebrate Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law No. 7176, entitled "On Implementing Monitoring of Potential Threats to National Security in the Economic Sphere".
Interestingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where the meetings of the board of directors of state companies and state banks are held.
The authors of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the state company's supervisory board in a hypothetical Kyiv may somehow solve the problem of national security of Ukraine.
We know about the large number of new hazards for state-owned companies, but we do not know about any company where there is a need to physically hold board meetings at the location of the company.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is a great basis for "undoing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing a manual management.
Such as it was in 2015.
Why should state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should be on them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then other bills may take off tomorrow - for example, the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be blamed on the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
On February 22nd, this norm was included in the comparative table of the bill 5397.
In general, the desire to disband the supervisory board in one way or another has been circulating among some popular candidates for a long time.
Not because of the criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will dismantle the arguments explaining the need for its adoption.
And then we will present our proposals on how to manage state-owned enterprises during a war.
Deputy Minister of Economy Dmytro Kudin explained the need for such a novelty, risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to take the necessary decisions, as a result of which the company's work may be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will he be able to prevent members of the supervisory board from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a fairly cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory board (who constitute the majority of the total composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, probably, it will lead to the loss of the quorum, necessary for the board of directors to take any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the board of directors, as the law provides for the need to conduct a competitive selection, which usually takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed law 7176 will most likely not protect the possibility of taking a decision by the supervisory board, but on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Naluhka provides other arguments in its support.
In particular, he notes that "many companies, including the defense industry complex (OPK), need to relocate" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom in Vienna."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board is in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in the "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a voluntary basis.
All power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will make the decision on the need to relocate any enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the holding.
In addition, such an argument does not hold up to criticism because the draft law 7176 does not introduce any changes to the legislation that regulates the activities of state-owned enterprises in the oil and gas industry.
Dmytro Pan, on his Facebook page, also presents arguments that can be categorised as "emotional".
Such arguments usually have nothing in common with improving the efficiency of state companies and banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "serious foreign experts leave Ukraine at the first mention of the word 'war' in 2021, but at the same time remain members of the boards of state enterprises in Ukraine with full salaries of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine is actually suffering from war".
First of all, this is manipulation - most of such members of the supervisory board never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, it is unfair to say that they are "leaving Ukraine".
Secondly, as a result of the pandemic of coronavirus, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This instrument is widely used in the world practice, and in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine and so on.
It should also not be forgotten that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
These people usually have other commitments and the means of electronic communication help them with this.
Thirdly, all these claims are read as complaints against foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitry not make identical claims against members of the board who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are not where their companies are.
To the best of my knowledge, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is merely a convenient excuse.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for temporary accommodation with a family. I have two children.

We usually ask for a passport of one of the adults.
In the Boryspil, Vyshgorod and Bila Tserkva districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a state of emergency will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct words: "In the occupied territories of the Boryspil, Vishgorod and Bucha districts, which were liberated by Ukrainian troops, the curfew is being strengthened!
Restrictions will be in place from 8pm on April 2 until 6am on April 5 in those areas.
Details: According to the head of the regional VA, at the moment it is categorically forbidden to be on the streets of populated areas and other public places, to use transport and to walk.
Residents will only be allowed out on the streets during a signal of alarm to move to shelters.
Such restrictions are introduced to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and mine the territories.
Omelianyk called on people who have left those areas to stay away for now.
The curfew will be in effect daily from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the rest of the Kyiv region.
Nothing has been sent to me from school yet, just an invoice for payment

Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing the army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine, the Western countries took the prediction of possible escalation in the Balkans very seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarussians aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling station in Osinovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Gennady Kazakevich, who is quoted by the state information agency "BeltA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that in the night of March 30, with the support of special forces "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured.
According to "Vyasna", the men were actively resisting and trying to escape when they were detained.
Security forces used weapons.
One of those detained received injuries and is in hospital.
Another provided medical assistance at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railway will be strictly suppressed" by law enforcement officers using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "Belorail" and administrator of thematic resources "Belorail" in "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
He is now whereabouts unknown, @belzhd_live reported.
At the end of March in Belarus, more than 40 railway workers were detained for sabotage.
Remember: The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenka regime as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on objects of railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus within the framework of the "Peremoga" plan.
Belarusian "railway partisans" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
As is known, through Belarus, Russia is delivering troops and equipment to fight in Ukraine.

US bans investment in Russia, imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against President Putin's daughters, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and are banning all new investments in Russia.
This was reported on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, while Alfa Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions freeze any assets they have in the U.S. financial system and prohibit Americans from doing business with them.
In addition, the US introduces a full ban on new investments in Russia.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden signed a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
This step is based on the decision of more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The exclusion of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms, the White House said.
The third step of new sanctions from the US were limitations against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This prohibits U.S. citizens from operating with these groups and freezes any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list will be published by the Ministry of Finance tomorrow.
The final part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can drive only to this place, then the road is blocked and I will come to you.
Ver, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for Skyap, my mother was a sewer of industrial products, my grandson Makarik was in kindergarten.
We were living very well, but even so, we did not think that we would have to flee, because it was no longer possible to hide in the basement.
Fortunately, I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we have hope that someone will take us in for a while (we can even pay for the room or apartment, but only if it won't be too expensive for us).
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don't have bad habits.
We will be grateful for such assistance at this difficult time for us.
After lunch I had one English lesson and then went to work in the children's room.
I explained to Margaret how to fill out all the forms.
I hope she understands and is doing well.
And I met with Mrs. Lena and we talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She made the announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't answer the phone, doesn't respond, doesn't know if she got to school
They are isolating the Russian office: stopping investments and supplies.
But we didn't see eye to eye.
There are no military men in our house.
Our house is near a military base and a petrol station
He just helped me out because I couldn't have done it myself.
Delicious, don't ask unnecessary questions and give good advice.
I give myself advice.
It's hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
In the fourth we meet and tell you everything.
Overall, everything is going well.
how often do you clean
I clean every week.
Sorry, I don't have a program, but I'll try to work it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can't go nowhere, so I didn't write the owner of the house.
Wanted to ask you, if you hear about any housing information, please let me know.
I'd love to rent a flat with a nice girl.
If you know, please let me know.
On their part - who knows.
Thank you in advance.
Natasha, 54 years old. Write me the exact address and how much the courses cost, please.
I think it would be better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my last name, it's the same as my birth name :)
Good morning, Mr. Reyarde! Excuse me, I haven't seen you. I am doing this now and will immediately send it to you.
We are going to the medical commission now.
In other words, Ani needs to work this hour on another day.
Which day is better for her to come earlier? (Is there a day with a bit more work?)
Tomorrow I will listen, the Internet is not working well. Almost
Whatever you do
Thank you ... found a few things from things, but ... there was no technology.
Both beginners, apart from the alphabet, know nothing
Nothing happens.
Is it possible on Monday 25th April?
You can take children with you, and there are enough toys here :)
Thought about Tat
Obviously, I'm very naive or very in love, but I'm going to do something with these dollars.
I'll find a way.
But how it will be paid, please, no credits.
Write me directly and I'll help.
You are my partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't even know.
Do you take your clothes with you?
Today is not my day. The curtains in the living room are broken. I'm alone in the morning. Now it's evening.
If something from you came, I don't see it.
Me too.
I will remind you of the fact later
Does your dad only speak and understand Russian?
On what day does the colleague want to do the cleaning of the house and how many houses have windows?
I'm sorry to be a distraction from your work.
Good evening, I can't not share with you. There's a message from Mariupol for your son - he's alive and well.
Radja reads up on Jo Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neural connections
Journalist of the "1+1" TV channel, Natalia Nagornaya, published a video recording sent to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol in the morning of April 12.
In it, soldiers say they have no ammunition left to take part in the fighting and there are mountains of the wounded.
They said that "time is money".
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade, which is defending Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in the Russian language.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not communicate with the fighters for two weeks.
Social media users expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, assured that the connection between the command and the forces of defense in Mariupol is, and the details of the defensive operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the factory "Azovstal" in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers threw a toxic substance of unknown origin onto Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of the "Aydar" battalion, Andrei Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the "AZOVSTAL" plant, which is held by the fighters of the "AZOV" battalion.
Thank you, I will tailor myself to you. This would be very good
The situation and we remain here.
2 hours walk )) shopping and back home!
This is not an important matter.
She forgot what she was going to do
The Czechüá®üáø drone squadron began flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional drones üöÅ will be used for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy invader üí•.
Two brothers from the Carpathians and two from the Czech Republic sent their "birds" to Ukraine yesterday, thanks to the deputy mayor of Mukachevo, Vladimir Labutenko.
Today their inter-mountain friends, led by the head of the settlement council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shcherbak, delivered the drones for the purpose for which they were intended: special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is now taking place received them.
In order to use drones as effectively and safely as possible, we will keep the locations of their bases a secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, they say: in the coming days, many interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Didn't worry, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can do without it.
I'm worried we won't make it. There's a lot of baggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine and will continue to work there.
Good. If everything goes well, I agree
I'll try my best, but if there are any problems, I'll let you know, okay?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally at the village elder in Yivov, who saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was no housing available.
Perhaps she will be happy and her mood will improve
My phone was repaired today.
I think that today I am still freezing on the street.
Drinking pills and tea, feeling worse but not critically.
It's also good for me, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
Whenever you have time, send me the music you like.
I love your musical preferences üòä
Listen to your mother and father.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's bike.
Today it was cooler and raining. Tomorrow it will be warm.
But it's not the houses that are destroyed, it's the people, who are humiliated by the occupiers
In Herson, occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Herson on the Prekopa Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, damaged panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Lowered the flag.
Good morning, thank you children for the carol, we don't have such a tradition in our country so we didn't know about it, we only gave children chocolate and cookies, perhaps something else needed to be given.
There is no one to talk to, if you know what I mean.
Because I live in a student dormitory, there are twelve people here and then they go to work
Hello a little better.
Today was a good day.
Even now he sleeps there.
Therefore, we have made great strides.
I'll definitely bring the vareniki another time!
Today I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I have to work on cleaning my apartment after guests, I can roughly say that it will be in April.
In May - can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
Just curious if anything is being said about this in your area.
Hello, sorry for not writing for a long time, I was cooking dinner and then I fell asleep a bit.
If you're still up for it, I could come over today?
or we can meet after your arrival.
He is humble with us, he has been studying a lot lately. He realized that this is very important for him in life
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people at such a high level.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the head of the department of regional economy.
She was very pleased with my work.
Gryshko was behaving well in the orchard.
On Monday I will bring confirmation of employment and cash payment for the job.
I'm looking forward to it from Friday.
I do nothing but make them a lot and sleep üòÇ (and drink a lot of water ‚òùüèª)
If tomorrow we go to the doctor, I will go with you, if possible.
I will bring another analysis.
and not have to drive again.
The drain is very clogged, it doesn't drain well. It needs a professional. It needs to be unclogged.
That's all there is
Can you please send me the correct email address?
I would like to invite you to a Czech language course, which you have signed up for.
Do they feed the children there or do you need to bring your own?
And now, a question for you:
If you need any help, just let me know.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't want to collect money from the very beginning, so that people wouldn't think we were profiting from it!
But for online filling in me it was not enough two points:
I will rest and recharge. Gathering my strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Much appreciated.

My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army.
Collected several works for her portfolio.
After the holidays, there will be internet.
Wanted to be your backup designer.
If I'm not at work, it's a day off for me
Deployment of troops: Russia preparing provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not ruled out that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for action on the Slobozhansky direction.
It is likely that the occupiers will try to resume hostilities in the coming days.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment for participation in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent base of the 60th separate motorized infantry brigade (Monastyrshchyna) of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that this equipment will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also for the restoration of losses in the composition of the battalion tactical group of the 36th separate motorized infantry brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th Army of the Eastern Military District, the recruitment of military personnel from the specified brigade is carried out.
A special problem for the enemy is the staffing of drivers and driver-mechanics.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is planned for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the areas of combat operations, will continue to strike the objects of transport infrastructure in Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Determined units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhanskyi direction, certain units of the 6th Army and the Northern Fleet's coast guard continue to partially block the city of Kharkov, and there are ongoing artillery attacks on certain districts of the city.
Air reconnaissance is being carried out in the Izium direction to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The enemy uses the drone "Orlan-10" for this.
Using two battalion tactical groups, the enemy attempted to launch an attack in the direction of the populated areas of Dovhenke and Dimitrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Lower, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted to carry out a storming operation in the Zolotoy area, but it was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, occupying forces continue to carry out assaults in the areas of the factory "Azovstal" and the seaport using artillery and aviation.
The enemy carried out artillery strikes on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the populated localities of Vysokopil'lya, Trudolyubivka and Mar'yanivske using separate detachments.
Over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian defenders have repelled four attacks by the enemy in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six automotive vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We always strive to be on time, but I doubt
And you how can you sleep you want me to hold you
Do you really not want me to come?
If you don't want to see me today, just let me know, I understand)
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home and especially not 1+1. We don't need to adjust :)
I turn on the TV just to listen to Czech
Today my monthly tariff package expires :)
Can we do this over the phone today?
Buy fabric for sewing, canvas, thread for sewing.
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I asked her. I was a little embarrassed to ask, but she gives us so many pies.
Me and my dad will meet again, for sure üôèüèª
I read an announcement on Facebook that perhaps Google wrote something of its own üèµÔ∏è. I think the telephone number is enough
Good day, my things which you brought took, but there are things which are small and can be brought to you in 10 minutes.
I thought about work.
If the boss schedules it, then I can start working next week because tomorrow after lunch I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if it works out, because there are long lines) and on Saturday it's going to rain :)
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech language to know it perfectly, I dream of working at Tesla.
Old friends and not very many, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now it is your turn to face difficult times.
Over the past month I've been talking to many of you.
Your life, which was never easy, has been turned upside down, just like the lives of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are leaving Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed of your country's actions towards your neighbours.
Because of this, you are subjecting Ukraine to your name.
For some of you, activists, the threat has been hanging over you for a long time, and you have been preparing for the final blow.
At the beginning of March I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
I'll tell you later - as usual, Sasha replied briefly. - Now we are walking through the ruins after the search.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - were shocked by the sudden collapse of your crumbling world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate him.
But let's be honest: except for a very few of you - those who worked in "Memorial", "Novaya gazeta", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organization and in a number of other places - how many of you did anything at all to resist this regime?
Other than attending rallies, when they were still happening.
Also read the column by the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to speak"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstractions?
Maybe they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and passive participation, which now, probably, weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
There was a brief period in the 1990s when you had a degree of freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not better than 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of chaos that you look for salvation behind the back of the king, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think he's safer around him. Why?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Gestapo, you devoted your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to lie low, regroup, reform and take control of the country.
When faced with the choice between looting the country and restoring communists, you didn't fight for the third option - and meekly accepted looting.
In 1998 your economy collapsed, marking the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern is survival.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and revive the economy.
Few of you bought into this, but either you voted for him, or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you looked away.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation" and I saw the ruins of Grozny, Kazan-Jurt, Itum-Kali and other towns with my own eyes.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and joked around with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: torture of innocent civilians, children being killed, soldiers selling the bodies of their fallen comrades to their families.
They told me: "Come on, we are tired of your Chechnya". I remember these words very well.
In response, I got angry: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a dorky foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeroes, driven by surging oil prices and Mr Putin's willingness to look the other way as some of the stolen money found its way into the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become wealthy, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices are going up, but who cares?
Moscow was festively shining and sparkling with lights.
When several opposition activists were killed - Yuri Shevchenko, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, things did not improve.
When after two terms Putin transferred the post of president to Medvedev and took his place as prime minister, you, as far as I can see, barely glanced at this.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or looked the other way.
How many of you I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the suburbs of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I must admit that we in the West did little or nothing if anything at all.
Some outrage, some sanctions; but what is the point of Russia blatantly violating international law when such a huge temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?
Life in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s, this was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Mr Putin returned to the presidency, as he did, many of you decided that enough was enough and took to the streets in protest.
Navalny's name became a byword, you didn't go out onto the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually realised that it was losing its footing.
He then struck back.
First there were alternative actions, then came more repressive laws, and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were jailed.
Some got very long terms.
What could we do?
I feel that so often and feel it still.
The state is so strong, and we are so weak.
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Take a look at what they did two years ago.
Fed up with a pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European dreams, they seized Kiev's Maidan - and never left.
They set up their own tent city and prepared to defend themselves.
When the police came and tried to demolish it, they started defending themselves with sticks, scaffolding and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, protesters attacked.
Many were killed, but they won.
Yanukovych fled, and Ukrainians reclaimed democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and get rid of them if they're not doing a good job.
The square was very unpleasant for Putin.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was beneficial.
How many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.
Suddenly, from nowhere, a new myth was born, and many of you, who despised Putin and his gang, suddenly turned 180 degrees and started worshipping him.
I don't know what happened because we stopped communicating immediately afterwards.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly kept quiet.
We don't care about politics, you said.
And they have new hideouts in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like new after restoration, which began in Moscow in 2012 - with their binbags, accessible Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and it becomes even more beautiful.
You turned your attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, weren't there?
ISIL or what? Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticised it at the time in an interview, saying that I knew nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I drove there myself and saw with my own eyes how government snipers shot down my children's friends in the streets of Homs.
Only your soldiers have been there, the ones who started bombing thousands of innocent civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next big war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
At first they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, but I remained silent - because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was nobody left to speak up for me."
How many of you have been talking about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did this.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some are indeed speaking now - for example, Dmitry Gluhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zhigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
The majority can afford to talk from abroad, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to end up in a new GULAG or to form a company with Navalny.
As for others, you best know where you live.
So, I'm sure you understand: when Putin gets done with the Ukrainians - or, as seems likely, if he doesn't, he'll come after you.
To all of you, my dear friends: to those who were brave, but mostly went out alone to the protests and still have a small term, but soon will have a serious one.
For every one of you who signed the petition, who voiced dissent on social media (even with just a black square on Instagram), or who spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote are long gone ‚Äì and now they, with a high probability, await you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will be left?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight against it.
And what reason, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how overwhelming his advantage on paper.
Considering everything, few in Russia realise how long the war has been going on.
But you, my friends, well know what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows that you know that.
So be prepared.
You know where this is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are a charade, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they're written on, there's no free press left, your last independent media outlets are gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you don't have credit cards to buy a plane ticket out of there, even if some flights still exist.
Now Putin is not satisfied with your silence, he demands your agreement, your obedience.
If you don't give him what he wants, he'll try to get it by any means necessary.
I doubt you see any other version.
And there is still one more.
Whoever eventually brings this regime down.
Perhaps, under the circumstances, you will need less than you think.
Consider that.
The spark will not come from you: due to the approaching economic collapse, it is most likely that it will flare up in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices go up and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if every city were to take to the streets on its own, as has happened periodically in the past, it would not be difficult for him to crush them individually.
What is needed is organization and coordination. The crowd needs to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical instrument - the internet, which regime can limit, but which still works and which can be restored almost under any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was disbanded, but others can be created, more informal, more decentralized.
You are many, you are millions.
Moscow police may deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If it goes over 300,000 she'll be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will it fight for Putin when the time comes?
After all, what he made them go through in Ukraine, for what he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a familiar fear; those with children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I was afraid too.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to defy their masters, those who not only demand freedom, but actually try to achieve it.
But even if you do nothing, countless lives will still be lost in vain.
Your son cracks a joke in a computer game chat room - he'll be arrested. Your daughter expresses anger on the internet - she'll be arrested. Your close friend makes a mistake - he'll be tortured to death in a Syrian prison.
This has been going on for many years already - and it will only increase, becoming more and more widespread.
So you have a choice. If you do nothing, you know what will happen.
Be cold-blooded, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were at school on Friday, we were told we could come in on Monday
We will be at home in the evening.
What you see me as a press secretary
How often do you go out for dinner at an expensive restaurant?
Once in a while I go to a fancy restaurant for dinner.
I'll try to explain it to you.
That's why we liked it very much and we wanted to do something even better.
She was in a building with a lot of people. She was exhausted.
I feel terrible, cough, fever, loss of voice, weakness and my head is spinning.
I must go to work
We have already done this, but said that those registered in April will receive money at the end of the month
We need to see the doctor on Thursday.
But at night I was writing to one lady who liked my work and wanted something from me at her house.
Waiting for new news from her and will definitely let you know.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building my career, spending a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
It was a waste of time, but it was life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicative, but I take marriage issues seriously.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people must love, respect, and trust each other.
At the moment, I haven't.
Good morning. Is it possible to buy forms for baking paska (paper or silicone)?
Good, thank you for the advice, I will now fill in the form with my passport.
She has a broken collarbone in a lying-down position, a broken ankle in a lying-down position, a wheelchair in a lying-down position, and everything is torn to shreds in a blender.
Mr. Reihard, please excuse me for disturbing you during non-working hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to the game room to see Natalie today to say hello.
She found herself in an awkward situation.
But when the children were going home, one mother refused to take her child, saying that she had come to look at things and tidy up the room with clothes, and Mr Valery opened our children's room until 19:00 yesterday.
Is that really true?
The working hours of the room are until 4 pm.
