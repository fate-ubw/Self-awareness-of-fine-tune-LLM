Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference: Students sing the leading role, research results make people’s jaws drop
A series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year at Zhejiang University yesterday evening.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major areas such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, etc. From a curious point, classmates have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biosensors: Your family physician
A smartphone-sized biological sensor was demonstrated on the spot by Zhang Dingming, a doctoral student of Biomedical Engineering College.
All you need to do is breathe in lightly, and this device can detect your health status based on the composition of the gas you exhale.
Zhang Dianming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone. When the gas is detected, the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
Smartwatches in the market can detect the health status, generally detecting physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material called stone varnish, which is designed to detect chemical elements. Its sensitive "nose" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Smart surgical light: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Zhu Linjing, a graduate student in the Department of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering at Tsinghua University and the team led by Shen Junfeng invented the smart LED surgical light.
Many diseases are detected and excised at an early stage, which is related to the lights in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfeng said that, for example, in cancer early detection, if the doctor cannot timely identify all the tumor tissue, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical lamp has four light plates, which can enhance the difference degree of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and transparency of the light according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This type of intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Zhengzhou University Medical College Affiliated Siefang Hospital and Zhengzhou University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won first prize in the national challenge cup.
Wash your hands with air: Save water and chill
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing with soap, squeezing hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of "air washing device".
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our weight can compress the air out.
Just like a balloon.
Compressed air forms a fluid at the nozzle and combines with water.
So we can wash our hands clean!"
Colored reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of this method of washing hands is the same as that of a regular hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleaning degree and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities worldwide and won the only gold award.

Okay, trouble.
A meaningful certificate - an emergency certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates in addition to my driver's license!
Briefly: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of sudden incidents, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that in the process of rescue vehicles arriving after an accident, there is actually a period of time, and this period is actually the most critical.
This is an emergency.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, or stopped breathing, our window of life would be four minutes, golden four minutes!
Therefore, people around you know how important it is to learn first aid!
When someone around us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there doing nothing and feeling helpless.
In China, our official data shows that 3 million people die of sudden death every year, and the most dangerous is heart attack.
In the United States, an average of 15% of people survive.
In a casino hotel in Las Vegas, about 78% can be saved, less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is what Lu Lei, the founder of the first response said.
If someone has a heart attack and stops breathing and their heart stops beating, you are useless.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions may be necessary to save a life.
I found that few people nowadays have this awareness to learn first aid, but when emergencies happen, it's too late to learn. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly when faced with emergencies.
Saying "I don't know" can save someone's life!
First aid certification can be obtained by registering at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and received a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before the age of 25, and adding the emergency card to the list of goals was something that happened a few months ago, but it was definitely accomplished!
Next, I plan to take other certificates that I am interested in. I also plan to take a scuba diving certificate. I saw a scuba diving emergency certificate on Xiaohongshu before, and I heard that you need to take an emergency certificate to take a scuba diving certificate. So, an emergency certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
13 yuan for a plate of dumplings?!
Never tried.
How can you not understand?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# sent food, this time a dumpling for me to eat!
Because before I input the code, I saw it was effective.
In conclusion, I personally believe that "Four Swords" is a comprehensive anime, from various perspectives.
But you have to say that this movie is not a bright spot, and it is not a good choice at least.
There are many kinds of movies that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and there are many ways to make you feel angry after watching a movie. For the audience, “4 Horsemen” is like a monkey on Mount Everest, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han really is a genius.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creature from the Cixi novel, difficult to name, and full of holes like the wind jacket on Xiao Ma Gao.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in it, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a load of rubbish.
To put it simply, there are some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should reside on a small island in the south with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, so the plot was arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive her to Northeast China to see the snow.
Are elderly people sitting in a bread truck looking at snow from the south to the northeast?
He and his father are very confident about this.
Then the old man just disappeared.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on a derelict ship?
Why can the Flying Island Party's little troublemakers easily block a mountain road?
The train carrying steel rods stopped on the side of the road, and the drivers of the surrounding cars could not find it.
This thing is too obvious.
Why would a fly-by-night gang suspected of illegal activities become a deputy police officer?
Why didn't he report the high-interest loan? In the movie, the police specifically asked whether there was any difficulty.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key at a hotel, so they forced to arrange to find the hotel manager and sleep outside the room.
This inexplicable plot is scattered throughout the entire film, and because the plot is too far-fetched, I remember it makes me feel painful.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the movie is its theme, or rather, this movie has no theme at all, it's just a face-palm-worthy mess.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think it's a comedy. More than 20 minutes later, you might think it's an inspirational movie. At the halfway point, you might think it's a coming-of-age story about the struggles of young people in a small town. By the end, you'll be left with a deep sense of doubt about why you even went to the movies in the first place.
For most people, it is very familiar with the plot of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a movie about a mechanic, you will encourage + comedy, then tell the audience a talented chicken is how to gradually move towards success.
If you want to shoot a love story, then you should talk about the grudge between the young man of the town who loves to ride motorbikes and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the norms of the real world.
You can't help but be reminded of Connery's Bond when watching Yann Demange's 71, in which the new Moore is burned and then sings.
As for the female lead, she may not be very intelligent, but she can act like a 5-year-old in some aspects. I don't know whether this is due to her acting skills or the director's request.
There is also something I don't understand. Why is Han Cun so fond of adding car chase scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of arrangement in the Spring Festival edition for the benefit of the audience?

Inspection of the production and processing equipment for the precast concrete module of the shale gas drill-hole. Characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou shale gas drill-hole brick module equipment:
It is advisable to inspect the new cement blocks used for underground construction of buildings such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Inspection of various types of wells, tanks, manholes, culverts, septic tanks, and small-scale structures such as bridges and retaining walls.
The advantage of using precast concrete modules to build inspection wells lies in the fact that the modules have a stepped structure around the top, bottom, left and right sides, forming a chain lock when assembled.
The reinforced concrete wall is far superior to the rammed earth form in terms of resistance to cutting.
The module is a hollow structure, and after assembly, the horizontal and vertical pores are connected, and the pores are consistent in the horizontal direction. After the porous ceramic is impregnated, a reinforced concrete web-like structure is formed, which provides secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Modules are horizontally and vertically equipped with screw holes, and the horizontal and vertical screws correspondingly increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, using concrete to inspect the inspection wells and drainage wells drilled out of the drilling module is not easy to collapse, sink, leak and other phenomena. The mechanical stability of the wall body module is good, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standardized.
The intelligent control equipment of the brick machine module of the concrete inspection drilling rig is equipped with data input and output devices, and the entire process of mechanical operation is monitored by touch-screen liquid crystal display. Ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of raw materials, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system are achieved.
The hydraulic system of the wall body module uses single-tube hydraulic pressure and delivery, and dual-tube hydraulic pressure and delivery.
An independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of main machine vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
Concrete inspection drill machine equipment brick mold hopper elevator, storage hopper door closed, automatic conveyor belt, fully completed by hydraulic system to reduce mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection drill module equipment adopts imported computers and appliances, sealed components, and ensures the overall performance and reliability of the equipment.
The vibration platform of the wall body module uses a steel plate as a whole, and the cutting line of the table surface is not welded, so that the filler box can swing freely and reduce mechanical wear.
Reduce the load on the mold, combine the filler and reinforcing agent, adopt integration and full synchronization, vibrate the table and the mold, and ensure that the vibration effect is achieved.
The vibration module of the wall body is a mechanical and electrical vibration machine, and the computer automatically controls the amplitude of the vibration according to the material cost ratio to adjust the amplitude, no wear and tear, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The wall body module has dual functions of automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Municipal Vocational College Pilot Modern Student System: Entrance is Employees of Enterprises-Chinanews.com
Yesterday, reporters learned from the city’s Education Committee that this year, our city will pilot the “modern apprenticeship” talent training model in 60 middle schools. Students who are accepted for pilot talent training will have the status of apprentices and will be pre-hired by pilot enterprises after enrollment.
The Ministry of Education requires that standardized recruitment and employment procedures be used by vocational schools and enterprises, and that the dual identity of students who are enrolled in vocational schools and employed by enterprises be clearly defined. A three-party agreement must be signed by students, schools, and enterprises, and a four-party agreement must be signed by students, guardians, schools, and enterprises for students under the age of 16 who have not yet reached the age of 18, in order to determine the rights and obligations of all parties and the specific position, teaching content, and safeguards for the training of students.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-employment training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
The pilot school will reform the talent cultivation model.
The school and enterprise jointly designed a talent cultivation program, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Pilot the educational system as a pilot cycle, students determine their internship time according to the talent cultivation plan during their internship in enterprises. Top internship usually lasts for 6 months.
In corporate practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented, according to the characteristics of different professions, one teacher can bring 2 to 5 disciples to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city divided into three batches to determine 60 pilot modern apprentices in the city level. The number of each batch is about 50, and a total of 3000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of piloting first and then expanding, the principle of gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for the joint recruitment of schools and enterprises, the joint training of personnel, and the integration of sports talents, so as to effectively enhance students’ employability and improve their employment quality.

South African doctors: Ebola transmission strong but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the illness caused by the new coronavirus Omicron variant is less severe than that caused by the Delta variant, although the spread rate is faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that they are currently treating patients with mild symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as body aches and coughing.
Dr Unben Pillay, chief executive of the organisation, said he was seeing several dozen patients a day but there were no inpatients.
People can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of quarantine, he said.
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to suffer severe complications from COVID-19.
He said compared with the previous wave, the new coronavirus patients he treated in the last wave had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen level.
Many people will be in hospital over the next few days."
In the two weeks following the first report of the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it takes several weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the past few weeks have severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while in the early cases in South Africa, the mortality rate was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, head of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports as saying: "Currently, all indications point to this being a mild disease."
He also said: "It's still early days, we need to get the late data.
Usually, hospitalization and death occur later in the course of the disease, and we are only two weeks into this wave of the epidemic."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although the Delta variant remains the predominant new coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of the Omicron variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in the first week of December in the province increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thank you for your support today, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education time: What do we rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service advertisement that says "No buying, no selling, no killing," then in a good environment with no demand for "extortion," group self-discipline and mass anti-extortion will make extortion unprofitable, risky, and expensive, so such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for the dissemination of information on missing children.
This is to establish an authoritative channel for disseminating information on missing children, and to create an internet information platform for timely recovery of abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this app, which is called "Circles," it sounds warm and cozy.
The new technological means are not only named "Literature" and full of sentiment, but also informationized application is proper and effective.
Protecting the physical safety and freedom of the abducted child is the primary goal of the search and rescue operation.
Secondly, there is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed as many "big words".
However, prior to breaking the news of the extortion case, the personal safety of the victim should be given priority.
In the face of urgent "rescue" purposes, such as whether children should be sentenced to death for child trafficking, controversial and heated topics can be temporarily postponed and discussed cautiously; but matters such as rescuing children cannot be neglected.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime has been committed.
Searching for a lost child takes one minute, and they may be one step further away from their parents. The difficulty of solving the case also increases by one minute.
In this case, taking direct action to help solve the case and find the child, such as using the "WeChat" platform, is indeed practical.
After all, "tackling corruption" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation to the safeguarding of the judiciary, as well as the clandestine operations of law enforcement, all require the care of "protecting the weak and vulnerable".
In addition, preventing child trafficking can be done better from the family to the society.
For example, a common scenario is that a family of three is resting at the train station, but when they wake up, they realize that their child is missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of young children, at least a certain level of protective awareness should be possessed.
Both parents taking turns to rest and entrusting the child to a reliable caregiver are the most basic means of preventing child abduction.
From the perspective of the police cracking down on human trafficking, those who purchase children for adoption should also be concerned and punished.
Individual illegal acts are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the statutory punishment for the crime of trafficking children is 5 years of imprisonment; in particularly serious cases, the death penalty may be imposed, and property may be confiscated.
The punishment threshold is high and the maximum punishment is severe. In the trend of "light punishment", child trafficking crime is obviously a crime with severe punishment.
To this day, there are still many cases of kidnapping occurring every year.
It can be seen that some people's outdated views on rearing children and weak legal awareness.
The legal education of these people should be carried out in parallel.
To effectively control drug trafficking, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" is widespread and the sellers are eager to innovate their selling methods, they will form a "fighting" situation with the law enforcers, and the crackdown operation will inevitably fall into a quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the backward mentality, popularizing legal norms, also helps to eradicate trafficking in children.
Yang Hao delivered a keynote speech on the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the 6th Provincial Congress
We should draw inspiration from the hundred years of struggle history of the Party
Hunan Daily, December 10 report (Reporter: Gong Baowei) According to the unified arrangement of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Hengdong, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Head of the Publicity Department of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, conducted an interactive publicity at the video creation park of Ma'anshan, and in-depth studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, the spirit of Xi Jinping's report to the 19th CPC National Congress, and the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Committee.
Yang Hao Dong expounds the essence and requirements of the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress from three aspects: ideal belief and initial mission, self-revolution and youthful enthusiasm, party leadership and party theory, and combines self-reflection and personal experience to expound the essence and requirements of the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress in an all-round and systematic manner.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the congress and the important instructions given by General Secretary Xi Jinping for the important speech of Hubei Province with the spirit of the Provincial Congress and the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee, blend them together, integrate them, enhance the consciousness, political consciousness, and action consciousness of defending the “Two Sets of Principles” and “Two Sets of Standards”,
During the interactive exchange session, grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishments", how cultural enterprises can grasp the direction, how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party, and so on.

In fact, it is not known whether the error was made by the store or the rider.
There is no receipt in the bag.
Unable to trace.
I hope you understand.
Because the delivery time was shown to be 30 minutes faster
No, thank you.

He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has been saying they are in the process of handling it.
Waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two main categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and removing impurities through filtration.
It can be divided into three levels according to the different pH values:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: is the highest quality and highest quality olive oil, it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and refreshing plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: slightly acidic, not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil (普通初榨橄榄油): flavor and aroma are still present, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the initial distillation of olive oil with an acidity of over 3.3%, or it becomes a "second oil".
Refining olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil, mixed to balance flavor, color and acidity, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent golden yellow color.
Refined olive-pomace oil or olive pomace oil: is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from the residue.
If you have looked at the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is important to know that olive oil is like wine grapes, coming from different regions and different varieties of olives, will produce different standards of olive oil.
Best place to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climate conditions for olive and oak growth, including soil, temperature, sunlight, humidity, and rainfall.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only cultivate zero-stars in their natural habitats.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and other countries with similar climates also have far-southern latitudes such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Olive harvest season:
From March to June every year, the olive tree blossoms and bears fruit. From October to November, the fruit begins to develop and matures, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The period from November to February the following year is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable fat for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
Democratic National Convention ends, Biden says the torch of liberty will never go out
The online "Democracy Summit" attended by government leaders from 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, was concluded on Friday (December 10).
In his closing statement, Biden said that the flame of liberty burns in the hearts of every person in the world, and authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that the second global "Democracy Summit" will be held next year.
Tang Feng, a Taiwanese government representative and member of the Executive Yuan, and Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said, "We know how hard the work is that lies before us.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I said before, democracy is nowhere to be found.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the spark of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world.
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the pillars of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability, and resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who seek power at the expense of the public interest."
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" will focus on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and opposing authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech on the same day that democracy is facing challenges globally, particularly the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions as well as democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong delivered a pre-recorded video message to the summit, reminding attendees to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities such as the Chinese in Hong Kong and Tibet.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been receiving the rise of China, but it has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must collaborate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Roh Moo-hyun also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid of incurring the displeasure of General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you are afraid of losing the Chinese market, maybe some of you are not aware of the threat of the Chinese Communist Party to our democratic values.
And that is why we failed.
This is also why we must change."
At the roundtable discussion entitled "Combating digital authoritarianism, affirming democratic values", attended by the Executive Yuan's Policy Advisor Tang Feng, the "National Declaration" was released via video, emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
He said, "At the dawn of Taiwan's democracy, we have always stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized violations of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of decline.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to boycott to overcome fake news.
On the same day as the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Department of the Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries that have been identified as having severely violated human rights, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been identified as having used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time was constantly being pushed back.

In short, I didn't call.
Hungry.
I will definitely complain.
If you can't give it to me, at least talk to me
Wait for me.

Why not give it a try?
Hello, the water chicken from the restaurant is alive
"I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a cheap coach first."
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap knock-off, which is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in strength, hit the knuckles with the ball, vibrate very much, the hard ball top cannot be stopped, and the high hand is very difficult to control.
Their rhetoric and subtext is - it's so difficult to play tennis, you know you can't learn, and you know you can't afford it, so let's confuse you with cheap goods, you play twice and you'll never play again, this way it's cheap, you won't mind.
"Until you can really tell the difference between good and bad, explain to me how you've progressed, and then come back here and buy the expensive one, I'll make twice the money."
Spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand golf club. Choose Prince or Dongfeng Precision. These two brands are not well-known, so they are not worth the money. A new golf club costs 500-600 yuan. A second-hand golf club costs 200 yuan. Is it worth enjoying a thousand-yuan club?
Be friendly to newbies, but once they get past the newbie stage, they're on their own, but most people, especially girls, never get past the newbie stage.
The delivery time of the order has been repeatedly delayed.
Can you help follow up?

Thank you.
In other words, I actually have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Is the previous order not working?

Can you check if they are still on the road? If so, send it to them.

In fact, a lot of attention is paid to the clothing and accessories of girls who are slightly overweight.
Girls who are overweight should not wear dresses that are too short or too long, as the length difference is not much, just enough to cover the area above the knee.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
Prolonged sitting can make people feel short and fat.
If you divide the upper, middle, and lower into three sections, you will naturally appear taller, which is achieved by using different colors for the upper body, skirt, and tights, giving the appearance of height.
In fact, many deep-colored clothes are the uniforms of chubby girls (the author has a lot of experience). Deep-colored clothes are also a good way to hide your body fat, and elegant black shorts are the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black skirt, can make you appear thinner.
If your ankles are too thick, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The larger the crowd, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
In order to avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, make them feel fat.
Girls who are slightly overweight must talk about the art of dressing well.
Don't wear tight-fitting short skirts, and make sure your shirt is not too short or tucked into your skirt. This will make you look very uncomfortable. If your legs are too thick, wear black opaque tights or a net skirt (the kind with small squares). Choose a soft-textured floral skirt, pair with a cardigan, and you can effectively cover up a plump girl's inadequacies.
Of course, plus-sized girls can wear shorts too.
Fat girls should wear short skirts with tops that match the color of the skirt. This will make your plump figure appear taller.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest combination for summer!
If you are plus-sized but have slim legs like an MM, I recommend choosing a dress with a luxurious feel.
Not only can it hide your flaws, but it can also showcase your strengths.
A-line skirts will make you appear slim, and are more suitable for plump girls. Choose a fitted top to create a layered effect, which will make you appear slimmer.
Wear a simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, even if you are plump.
Thin girls can also dress fashionably.
As long as the rules of dressing are mastered, even the fat girls will become the focus.
In terms of dressing and matching, there has been a change. In life, we must move more and strive to break away from the label of being overweight.

Girl becomes a target for her sister's fundraising: "It's okay even if I get hurt" - Xinhua
A girl in Hangzhou Wulong Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, 10 yuan, one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Guan 'arrow' for recruiting donations" went viral on WeChat.
A photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target practice, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it in Hangzhou Wulong Square.
The incident triggered a heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the spokesperson of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Sub-Branch confirmed to New Beijing News reporters that the police have confirmed that the girl is the sister of the donor. The police have confirmed that the girl made such an impulsive move because of her sister's donation. However, such behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl left the local office yesterday.
Girl on street corner "arrow" solicits donations for defendant
In an image circulating on the internet, a long-haired girl poses in front of a large wooden board on which the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan one arrow" are written in black ink. In front of her is another wooden board on which her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay accounts are written.
The picture caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "shameless self-promotion" and many netizens expressed their agreement.
We discovered the situation at around 10 am on the 23rd when we were patrolling the square. At that time, the crowd had already dispersed.
Local media reported that the staff of the water supply company near the scene said that the two girls at the stall were aged about 20 and dressed beautifully.
In particular, the girl who played the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play the game; while another girl was standing by the roadside, helping to drink, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees.
We contacted local police and learned that the girl was soliciting donations for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the spokesperson of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau sub-bureau told the reporter of New Beijing News that the girl named Jia Jia Li raised money for her sister Jia Yan.
However, due to the fact that the treatment still costs more than $300,000, an ingenious fundraising idea was devised.
He said that throughout the entire process, the two girls took turns as the target and the one responsible for hitting the target, but neither of them actually participated in the shooting. During the entire process, no one was found to be shooting, but there were people surrounding and taking photos, which were then posted on Weibo.
After the police were notified by the security department, it was identified that the bows and arrows used did not fall within the scope of regulation.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate this way of fundraising."
After being warned by the police station, she left the police station.
Heat dissipation effect: good, lightweight degree: convenient, appearance material: satisfactory, durability ratio is high.
The new machine is very good.

It's really great to buy a notebook, mainly for design purposes. The price-to-performance ratio is very high. It's lighter than I imagined, and it's even more beautiful than I imagined. The red on the back of the notebook is the color of a very good-looking wine. It's not too flashy, and the overall design is much better than expected. It's a very good purchase, and it's suitable for both men and women.
Two years ago, I began to contact the Huge Dark Night Rider. It took two years, and the quality was much higher than the price!
I also recommend that my friends buy this product!
We have already purchased this series of 3 machines!
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also very good.
I bought tickets for the 418 bank event for my out-of-town relatives, but they ended up using them urgently, so I bought them in advance, missing the big bank event.
However, the price is quite high and the logistics is also quite fast. Let’s wait for the review in a few days.

He said it was a good thing to buy for his son.
The computer is very good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, even if you don't know, you can ask, recommend to buy.
It's not bad, the graphics of the game are really beautiful.
What was the hottest thing in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it was the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympian athletes can win awards?
A few months ago, there was an article titled "Quick! Project Manager Can Win Gold Olympic Projects" that was very popular. In the article, it was mentioned that in many projects, project managers can absolutely be in the vanguard and no one can catch up: moving bricks, going on business trips, staying up late are the daily routine of project managers, while firefighting, cooking, and apologizing are not even worth mentioning.
The article appears to be humorous, but it also reveals the daily struggles of project managers, which is a reflection of the current project management work.
People engaged in project management work are also gradually choosing to escape the difficulties of their work through some actions.
From the number of people who register for the PMP certification exam each year, it can be seen that more and more project managers are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the "20th Anniversary Report on China's Project Management Development (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® exam takers in China was nearly 600,000, with approximately 420,000 passing the PMP® certification exam, and around 300,000 effective holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total global PMP® holders.
In the past decade, the number of PMP certified professionals has been steadily increasing, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that relying on outdated "best practices" is no longer an option in today's rapidly changing work environment. We must learn to adapt and explore new paths with the guidance of scientific giants.
However, passing the PMP exam can ensure smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners indicate that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically grasp knowledge points related to the ten areas and five processes of project management, but they are still at a loss when it comes to actual project management work.
Many project managers often receive feedback on the following issues: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and institutional support, unable to implement in the work, project estimation is inaccurate, control sensitivity is poor, project progress is slow; unclear division of labor among members, "old oil barrel" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-departmental communication difficulties, project progress is difficult to promote.
Therefore, the focus on product innovation and R&D management has helped numerous excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers, and other R&D key talents, and has won the honorary title of “China’s Base for R&D Management Talent Training”. Tianhua Consulting, with its “R&D Project Manager Training” online course, has come to help.
"Online Course: Project Manager Training" is an online fragmented learning method that combines numerous real-world case studies, tools, and methods from research and development enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions for project management, and move forward on your own project management journey.
This is also an opportunity for companies to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers, resulting in efficient operation for the company.
You can ask other students for their opinions on the course: This course is not only taught by a team of experts from Zhongtian Huaxia (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodologies and numerous well-known enterprise real business scenarios to provide a comprehensive and professional explanation of the course content.
In addition, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students translate the content of their studies into practical work.

JD “Double 12” pre-celebration advocates rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
This year’s “Singles’ Day” online payment business transaction volume amounted to RMB1.77 trillion, setting a new record.
The abundant and colorful red envelopes, the live broadcast with goods, and the shopping carnival once again make consumers shout for joy. On the one hand, this consumption trend makes people admire the strength of national consumption. On the other hand, we must calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer group of today.
On the eve of New Year’s Eve, JD Financial Services Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “JD Financial”) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" published by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in the financial consumption sector, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further enhance basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low. "One-to-one" will still be the focus of financial education. The "2019-2020 China Young Consumer Report" issued by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Young Consumer Credit Report" issued by CCTV Financial and Economic show that the young generation has tremendous consumption potential. Consumer spending is an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people use credit products. Nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although young people as a whole show a rational spending trend, they are not immune to the "over-spending" label. Some young people's excessive spending and imitation behavior have led to excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even caused social problems to gradually increase.

Vietnam Net - The Gulf Cooperation Council should address common challenges
Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of King Mohammed VI to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have broken off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have had a serious impact on the internal solidarity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and have had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit, when the Gulf countries signed a US-Kuwaiti-mediated agreement towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
Gulf Arab countries have resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar, out of the need to unite for the benefit of their countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the visit of Saudi King Salman to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' companies have signed a memorandum of understanding worth $3 billion.
The Saudi King's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with Iran's nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was signed by major countries in the world to rescue Iran's nuclear program. The Gulf Arab countries negotiated the agreement, which was condemned by the Gulf Arab countries because they could not solve the missile problem with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always considered Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that not resolving the Iran missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region are flawed.
In the context of the failure of nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that contribute to the slowdown of economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first since the end of disputes between some member countries and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic efforts to promote the restoration of the Gulf Cooperation Council as a unified entity, while proposing various measures to ensure full cooperation among its member states to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

Claimed to be the city with the loudest exhaust sound!
This time, our team brought the car that many men dream of to everyone!
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini - the Aventador LP700-4!
With a price of nearly 20 million yuan, an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast 700 horses can go?
The editor doesn't know either, but according to data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is about the time it takes for the editor's Myvi to reach 30km/h.
The low-slung body, tensioned doors, huge air intakes all around the car and the glassy 6.5 litre V12 engine at the back perfectly embodied the Lamborghini style.
There is no need to say too much about the specifications of the car. Just Google it and you will know. Here are some explanations that Google may not have given.
It's too crowded and everyone is staring, it's not very comfortable! (But it's kind of nice)
1km cost about RM1 (car owner doesn't really care)
If you don't practice getting in and out of the car, it can be a bit awkward (because you'll be stuck halfway in the car).
The engine is too loud, but it's still very pleasant.
The car is too big, so it's very narrow when it stops in a regular parking spot, and I'm afraid of being hit by the car door when it opens!
A bit lonely, because there was no one on the road (laughs).
Don't be mistaken, this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you're a friend who loves taking videos of your car, we'd love to hear from you!
If you want to know more about cars, check out The Car Guide / People's Automobile Magazine.
It's a priceless car accident!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both cars that car enthusiasts recognize. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the Porsche 911's price is also in the million-dollar range!
A few days ago, foreign countries collided with millions of sports cars 911 and thousands of super sports cars Chiron in just a few minutes!

Let the spirit of the university coincide with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic concepts and values that a university has accumulated over a long period of development, which is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our country's universities, they were born in the autumn of national danger, and their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times. They advocate the values of "righteousness and justice in the world" and "strengthening the country through education."
Currently, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly apparent. The global competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying, and the higher education sector, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reforms.
In particular, the proposal of the overall plan for advancing the construction of world-class universities and disciplines in China has demonstrated the confidence and determination of our country in advancing from a high-level educational power to a high-level educational superpower, and has also set higher and more up-to-date requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to be among the top universities in the world in a relatively short period of time, while also accelerating the construction of several world-class universities and disciplines on the basis of a certain gap?
In addition to having clear goals, confidence in the path, and confidence in one's abilities, colleges should also fully leverage three advantages: firstly, the advantage of lagging behind, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas scholars, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and academic quality; secondly, the advantage of cultural superiority, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, thereby consolidating strength, building a brand, and enhancing image; thirdly, the advantage of institutional superiority, leveraging the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal-orientedness, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for colleges to accelerate their advancement to the forefront of the world.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be achieved by a single school alone. Each school must display its individuality and characteristics while leveraging its strengths.
The feature of colleges should have both the common Chinese characteristics and their own unique features, including their own unique positioning, academic tradition and resource endowment.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three aspects of distinctive features in our teaching: one is to emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talent, to build an integrated educational and enterprise environment that combines science and education, and to create a full chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the second is to emphasize the distinctive features of academic interdisciplinary meetings, to promote the optimization and adjustment of the academic system, to create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and to actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary fields and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; the third is to emphasize the distinctive features of the teaching system and social services, to carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and to accelerate the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University research and production alliance.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the “Seeking Truth and Innovation” school motto, “Study hard, be virtuous, be discerning, be down-to-earth” common values, and “Embrace the world’s rivers and seas, be enlightened and virtuous, be a pioneer, be patriotic” are the newest expressions of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important safeguard for the school to adhere to the correct way of studying, continuously accumulating cultural height and gathering spiritual strength, profound in meaning and far-reaching in significance.
In particular, "Hainan River and Yangtze River" emphasizes the open and inclusive spirit, embodied by the idea of "the world's talents are at my disposal"; "Truth Seeking and Benevolence" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and doing good, which means that universities should not only pursue truth, but also be attentive to ethics and morality; "Pioneering and Patriotism" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the pursuit of knowledge and innovation in science and technology, but also the spirit of reform and development, and the spirit of breaking new ground; "Serve the nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in harmony with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values are the soul of Zhejiang University, which has been in existence for 120 years.
The wise hear without hearing, the enlightened see without form.
Chinese colleges and universities should take a further step to consolidate the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp the historical mission of higher education in the era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independent freedom, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the nation can mutually stimulate each other, thereby providing unlimited driving force for achieving national prosperity and revitalizing the nation.

As NFTs hit the market, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic started earning stable income by playing this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game built on blockchain technology, which includes various NFT games. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume and has exceeded $3 billion in transaction volume.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity’s daily revenue exceeded US$8.2 million, close behind Honor of Kings.
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
Axie Infinity’s popularity will introduce a new “palytoearn” model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single role. In addition to obtaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but is ensured by the blockchain technology.
Seeing news about a friend's stock, my biggest feeling is the company's choice on the track, that is, to invest in the industry with a good growth space, at least more than 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the industry with good growth potential in the future, to consider the industry growth in the best state in the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the playing field refers to the market size, the length of the playing field refers to the industry development stage, and whether the playing field is flat or hilly indicates the competitive landscape of the industry.

The strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find direction, and the tactics are to implement. In most cases, there is room for strategic thinking in tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking) can be considered in the current field, whether to deepen the current area or extend the field horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can be considered in terms of how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of improving activity participation rate (tactical thinking), KPIs can be set correctly to achieve the right goals, such as improving target customer participation rate, activating inactive high-value customers, and targeting new customers; in terms of improving DAU (tactical thinking), whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable can be considered.
Bitcoin, which was born 12 years ago, witnessed several milestones in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador will peg the Bitcoin to the US dollar, making it the first time for Bitcoin to become a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF by ProShares, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the US capital market, further expanding the cryptocurrency investment market.

Chinese-American groups accuse Yale and three other Ivy League schools of discriminatory recruitment - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Washington D.C. May 23 wire (Reporter: Xu Yanmei) More than 130 ethnic groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminate against Asian applicants during the recruitment process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the suit, held a press conference in Washington the same day.
At the press conference, Zhao Yujian, the chairman of the organization, said that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of US top universities has doubled, but in these three US top universities, the proportion of Asian students has basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called "holistic admissions" process, these colleges "systematically and persistently discriminate against Asian applicants."
According to Zhao Yukun, the study conducted by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that among these three colleges, the admission rate of applicants who are relative to African Americans is the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Education Department also shows that at all Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have essentially quotas for Asian applicants that have been in place for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukui told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expected the US Department of Education and Justice Department to conduct investigations after they filed a complaint, and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asian applicants after determining the facts.
They also hope that colleges will take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change their admission policies for Asian students.
Three colleges that have been accused have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 to protest Harvard University's admissions policies, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American organizations, the participants in this appeal also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Yuyang Town, Zhejiang Province from his house. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of purchasing a factory building with the relatives of the owner of the property, Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a down payment through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the recipient of the deposit in the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Agreement", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to purchase this factory, the deposit shall be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit shall be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties shall sign a factory purchase and sale contract within a week."
However, due to the failure of both parties to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of factory sale and payment method, the housing purchase and sale contract could not be signed.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned 200,000 yuan in cash to Mr. Lu a few days later.
Good houses are not easy to see, the down payment has been made, the mortgage has also been prepared, they are just about to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell, which makes Mr. Lu feel frustrated and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu took Lin to the Yaojiang District People's Court.
After legal proceedings, the court held that the failure of the parties to sign a formal contract cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably inferred that the negotiations failed. Therefore, this case should not be applied to the fixed-fine rule. The defendant does not need to bear the double return of the fine.
After the verdict, the defendant filed an appeal.
Recently, the Second Appellate Court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer reminder] Be cautious and take necessary precautions in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the due diligence obligations, such as verifying the ownership information of the house, whether the house is occupied by others, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when fulfilling the contract.
On Saturday (December 11), Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a statement that the U.S. holding the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "a conscious attempt to politicize and militarize democracy, and to use the name of democracy to carry out anti-democratic activities, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has been imposing its political system and values on people, promoting 'democratic reform', imposing unilateral sanctions, instigating 'color revolutions', and causing disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long been the US's 'weapon of mass destruction' in interfering with other countries.
This summit is an action by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted via video conference, with 111 country leaders invited, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and domestically, such as criticism of the invitation to leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders from countries like the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who question the true intentions of the Biden government in organizing the summit, which is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Germany's new Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also participated in the video conference.
China's foreign ministry statement on Saturday said, "Today's U.S. disease of democracy is on full display. Issues such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and the gap between the rich and the poor are becoming increasingly prominent." The U.S. democracy is built on a capitalist foundation and is a "game for the rich."
In his speech, U.S. President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and better resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who seek power for their own selfish interests at the expense of the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not inevitable, "We must constantly update it in each generation, in my opinion, this is a decisive challenge for our time."
Biden also said, "At a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and troubling challenges, democracy requires champions to defend it."
The United States has pledged to carry out a one-year action plan following the democratic summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy worldwide and provide support for independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical democratic summit in late 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report our progress next year."
Okay, I'm afraid he might have sent the wrong address.

Education Thoughts: How the college entrance examination makes "scholars" and "nerds"
Three students from Lanzhou Transportation University wrote letters to the school administration expressing their confusion about the university exam and proposing to raise the difficulty of the exam, change the exam format, and make the exam truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a "hot topic."
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with varying abilities and learning levels, making the learning situation diverse.
There are different opinions when it comes to testing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam consists of a single type of question with a high rate of repetition, the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam with flying colors by concentrating their efforts before the exam. If they want to try other methods, they may achieve twice the effect with half the effort.
In this way, students who are not diligent in their studies can pass the exam and even get high scores. Students who are not diligent in their studies often have good attendance, good homework, and good performance in exams.
In this way, it seems that the students of Lanzhou University are not the only ones who reflect the problems that exist in the college entrance examination, and this situation is not exclusive to Lanzhou University.
From this perspective, it is necessary to commend the three students who wrote direct letters.
In fact, those who have graduated from college are well aware of the phenomenon of students who prepare for the college entrance examination, think of various ways to “steal” questions from their teachers, strive to expand the scope of the examination, and seek “priority guidance” before the examination. Such phenomena are not uncommon, and even during the examination, holding a small notebook and asking the teacher to raise their hand is not an uncommon sight.
In the writer's opinion, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, measuring the passing rate of a university exam is more about the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific topics based on this foundation.
Entering the college undergraduate stage, the majors begin to differentiate, and many majors focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content to be tested in the college entrance examination.
The basic knowledge of undergraduate studies is mainly the basic theories and general knowledge of the discipline, from the perspective of knowledge, the changing space is not large, basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still the focus now."
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and it does not mean that the examination types are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually composed of multiple-choice questions, which are then compiled by senior faculty members, and the grading is also participated by all the teachers of the department, so as to overcome the problem of test duplication to a certain extent.
However, to propose a set of test items that are in line with actual teaching and learning, the titles of the test items should be based on the overall learning situation of the students, and should have a normal distribution. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and analyze the degree of student learning comprehensively, so as to enable the test items to have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and type of the test items. At the same time, the test items should be able to highlight the examination of basic knowledge and the examination of ability, while also being innovative and designed.
Examinations are the mainstay of university education. There are different types of examinations, and students will have corresponding study plans accordingly. In the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students' suggestions and has implemented a comprehensive plan throughout the campus.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to conduct seminars and final exams in parallel with self-examination, formulate examination questions and related regulations, strengthen supervision and verification of examination questions and the examination process, refine the grading system, and strengthen comprehensive examination of all teaching and learning areas.
Dealing with issues such as single-type and repeated questions in examinations is a problem that universities need to face. Of course, corresponding regulations need to be introduced, but this is a daily problem that requires teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It is not enough to understand the content of teaching, but it is also necessary to understand the learning situation of students. Teachers and students need to interact with each other in a positive way, so that the examination will be more in line with the actual situation. This will make "scholars" and "scholars" get what they deserve.

Golden Lady Wedding Dress Photo Shoot (Nanjing Store) Temporarily does not have a branch
Before taking photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't arrange the time well. However, Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a nice weekend to take pictures.
Ms. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised.
That was my first official makeover in my life, wow~ I can't believe that one day I will look that good, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry, I forgot her name) are very patient and skilled at makeup.
The scenery was shot in the Yangtze River Delta. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and it was not cold at all. At the time of taking photos, the makeup artist kept paying attention to our clothes, hats, and even helped us to arrange them.
The photographer is also very humorous, and feels very happy every day.
When taking photos, because we have seen many cases online, we don't want to make the guests delete too many photos, but when we take photos, we really don't think about adding more photos. In fact, we didn't even think about adding more photos. The 24 photos in the package were all included, and there was only one photo that was not included. I almost took a photo of my girlfriend's wedding gown, and there were more than 7,000 photos in the package, and more than 10,000 photos were added. At that time, I was stunned, and I was afraid that I would take too many photos.
The photos were improved today, Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they were not very good. They immediately helped me redo them.
Compare the photos that her sister took before, I feel that our photos are really satisfied, simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go and take wedding photos with Mrs. Han!
Bundle price: 3999 yuan
Ms. Gong thanked everyone for their sincere wishes and said that the future looks bright.

3,200 newborn babies without birth certificates in Sabah
According to Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the Civil Affairs Bureau of Sabah said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since October, and the number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, according to Kari Amunts, the head of the agency, all babies who have already applied for a birth certificate will have their information recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued next week.
At the press conference, he made a report on the printing problem of a web media for 10 months, and made an explanation.
He said that the problem emerged two months ago and Sarajevo is also facing the same issue.
One reason is that Chinese manufacturers producing anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in shipping to our country.
He explained that the counterfeit paper used by newspapers in Saba and other areas is different from that used in other areas, so they cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Kuala Lumpur: It was revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper was received in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
The agency will send a person to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to collect the goods and bring them back to Sabah for the final printing stage, which is estimated to take two working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicants to collect their admit cards from the respective regional offices.
He added that Saba has issued a total of 20,480 birth announcements so far this year.

Qiang said that China and Canada have a special "Olympic necktie".
In 1984, the Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also kick off, presenting a concise, safe and splendid show to the world.
The Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes that the two countries will deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events, athlete training, and other areas. The Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridge role, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, so that the two peoples can "move forward together" and achieve good results in the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, and Qui Ping was invited as a guest to award Bosnia and Herzegovina's best young athlete.

The State Council issued a document requesting to strengthen the prevention and control of epidemics in coastal cities.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11 wire (Reporters: Dong Ruilin, Geng Tiancheng) The Ministry of Public Security recently issued a notice to strengthen the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus epidemic in coastal cities. It requires people who have recently left land border cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land) to hold a negative nucleotide test certificate for a period of 48 hours before arriving at a land border city. After arriving at a land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleotide test.
According to the notice, the time frame for the aforementioned requirements is from the date of determining the coastal city scope in each province and city to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that conditional coastal cities may study setting up epidemic control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the local economy's main pillar, and people from both sides frequently cross the border.
Implementing differentiated management policies based on division, turning a single prevention line into two lines, is expected to achieve border transfer, reduce the risk of outbreak, and minimize social impact and costs to achieve maximum effectiveness in disease prevention.
Recently, there have been several outbreaks of locally transmitted epidemics in our country, all of which have been imported from foreign cities.
The aforementioned notice pointed out that some local epidemic surveillance alerts were not timely, high-risk personnel were not effectively isolated, regular fumigation was not implemented, formaldehyde testing was irregular, refrigerated items were not properly disposed of, centralized isolation management was not in accordance with regulations, and emergency treatment was not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires efforts in nine aspects, including improving the urban epidemic prevention and control mechanism, strengthening the epidemic surveillance warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to accelerate the rectification of weak links in the urban prevention and control mechanism, to do a good job in prevention and control work, and to strengthen the external defense line.
The notice emphasizes that cities on both banks of the Yangtze River should research and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic in parallel with the work of ensuring people's livelihoods, publicize and open up the hotline for ensuring people's livelihoods, regularly check the latent problems in the supply of basic necessities and prices, and timely solve and actively respond to the prominent problems reflected by the public.
According to the notice, the coastal cities referred to include those with open land, water and air ports in the counties (cities, districts, and autonomous regions) where they are located, as well as the cities themselves, and the specific scope will be determined and announced in a timely manner by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

U.S. Military Covered Up Truth of 20-Year-Old Massacre - Xinhua
(Video source: Oil Pipeline)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary called "Killer Robots" on the oil platform caused widespread attention.
The movie tells the story of the United States launching the Afghan war under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", forcibly imposing American democracy on Afghanistan through war, and committing various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, distorting humanity, and establishing death squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black hole" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
The atrocities committed against humanity have fueled more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more fearful".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but has only brought a diseased country and countless acts of destruction.
Watch the video, let's come together to uncover the truth behind America's pretext of "anti-terrorism" and shed the false mask of American democracy!
Unexpectedly came across the following article, from the perspective of business and preservation period, it talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the tax area to help with palletizing. Although palletizing is a deep processing, it is not within the operating scope of the tax logistics company. Here are some words that may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many chocolate factories and saw many production lines of chocolate.
In fact, the powder of the packaging and the ear is the same material, there is no difference.
So everyone will certainly ask: Why is the warranty period for packaging one year, while the warranty period for hearing aids is two years or longer?
Or, to put it another way: Why is the price difference so large between the earrings and the bags?
In fact, many consumers, or even mothers, think that the quality is much better because of the different raw materials.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the more expensive it is, the better it is.
There are also consumers who eat and say that the taste or flavor is not the same as the packaging!
Now I'd like to take a moment to address the elephant in the room. Where is the money?
Why are their prices so different despite using the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the packaging price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept. This means that the manufacturer's profits are low or even negative. So how does the manufacturer survive?
Therefore, they have a significant upside in terms of pricing to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote earplugs rather than bags.
There are so many brands that spend tens of millions or even billions of yuan on advertising every year. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
With the development of society, the marketing expenses, such as mall promoters, mall listing fees, product gifts, advertising fees, etc., are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is continuously introducing new products, and they are listening, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, these are new products resulting from the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 dollars.
There are also some brands that will do anything to promote their products, including hiring doctors to hang banners in hospitals to help promote their products, earning profits of 30 to 80 yuan per banner.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operating methods, and in fact, such practices are designed to defraud consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy pre-packed milk powder and store it in cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on children.
Don't think that the warranty period of the packaging is longer than that of the packaging. If the warranty period of the packaging is the same as that of the packaging after opening the package, it is only because the packaging after opening the package is not easy to preserve and easy to deteriorate.
The food is cold, dry, and hard to eat.
And the soup also spilled out.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua
When browsing the book market, one can often feel the heat of successful educational books.
Nowadays, many successful self-help books promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what you need to do "is what."
In other words, let's talk about the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books have a common characteristic - either do their best with all their might, or do nothing at all; either 100%, or 0%; either climb Mount Tai, or do nothing at all.
This "best practice" will make everyone admit that it is "absolutely right", but 99% of people will be scared to death at the starting line.
Because this theory preaches a path of "you must be resolute, remake yourself, and make a 180-degree turn," which is a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who adhere to the status quo, follow the old ways, and resist change, you tend to preach to them, "You need to change," as if it's a joke or a circus act.
The vast majority of people will hesitate at the threshold of "transformation", reluctant to move forward; or they will make a decision to undergo "transformation" based on momentary impulse and pain, and take the first step bravely, but it is often short-lived, and they will fall down after a while, unable to persist.
The famous dialogue "From tomorrow onwards" by Mr. Marlon Brando in the movie "A Streetcar Named Desire" is the most classic representation of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people, making the vast majority of people "dream of the door".
Perhaps, "the second principle" is a way that could lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "small wins lead to big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Everest, just climb the small hill in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
In summary, doing anything is better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in threshold, there is now a greater possibility for the average person to persevere, and as long as they persist, their chances of success will increase.
However, following the "second-best principle", the path to success is slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" may seem like a rallying cry for success for everyone on the surface, it ultimately only inspires a small number of people; whereas the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.

The amount of raw materials contained in Qinghai Lake increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Xining December 11 wire (Reporters: Lu Xiaofei, Zhang Hongyang) Reporters learned from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results show that the volume of Qinghai Lake’s bare shrimp resources has increased by 71,000 tons compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial period of protection in 2002, the cumulative growth has exceeded 40%.
The mudfish, a famous species in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in ensuring the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in Qinghai Lake.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale slaughtering and overfishing, as well as the degradation of the aquatic environment, the number of Qinghai Lake's naked carp has sharply decreased. In 2002, the reserves of Qinghai Lake's naked carp were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked shrimp was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red Data Book.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes to raise fish, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from catching and selling raw carp and their products in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and its surrounding areas.
At the same time, by artificial breeding and discharge, as well as cleaning the main inflow and outflow channels of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish pass" and other measures, the reserves of Qinghai Lake have been continuously enhanced.
Yang Ling, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, Qinghai Lake has released nearly 180 million fry for artificial breeding and has contributed more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake’s resources.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai Province is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the westward spread of desertification.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the Qinghai Lake watershed, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province has successively issued notices of key areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake for the prohibition of fishing, and has established a "one river, one lake, one key area" comprehensive management system.
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to pay for food that exceeded $180.

Just curious, is the takeout food packed in a bag?

Thanks for your help.
It has been 1 hour, but it has not been delivered yet.
I just read a sample essay and it was too long.
Knowledge is power.
Most girls will experience their first period at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and again around the age of 50.
It will be held every month under the premise of good health.
However, it is not a regular pattern that can be accurately predicted, with a standard deviation of about a week, it is necessary to prepare in advance, and sometimes the luck can change suddenly (advance several days).
The duration of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of pain vary from person to person. Some people take three days, some people take a week; some people have little bleeding, some people have a lot of bleeding; some people have no reaction, some people are in pain until the ambulance arrives; the pain changes with time and does not mean that it will not hurt for a lifetime.
Blood loss of up to 24 hours a day for several days cannot be controlled. Only by using a sanitary napkin or sanitary towel can blood be prevented from staining the sofa.
The main reason for the pain is due to the secretion of testosterone, which usually occurs at the beginning of the physiological period. Eating broccoli promptly can effectively alleviate the pain at the beginning of the month, but it is useless after the pain begins.
During the physiological period, due to excessive progesterone and testosterone release, it is easy to get pregnant.
If it's been about a week, don't be surprised if your stomach starts growling again in a couple of days.
It is best to change the toilet paper every 2-3 hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 pieces. If you add the pre-prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces per month.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Replace the sanitary towel every 5-6 hours or after 8 hours of use, whichever comes first."
The hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may cause mood swings, and the hormonal changes during pregnancy can also cause mood swings due to unstable emotions.
But official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Menstruation is not just blood, it contains shedding uterine lining.
After the end of the menstrual cycle, the uterine lining becomes the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. This can be understood as the uterus being a house, preparing to receive guests each month (the uterine lining becomes thicker) by building a new house (the uterine lining is shed). If there are no guests, the house is dismantled (the uterine lining is shed) and rebuilt in the next month.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For several decades, it lasts for several days every month and causes bleeding for 24 hours. It also causes abdominal and back pain. Who would want to go through this?
However, people are born because their mothers have menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare the house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. We should thank our mothers for their healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things were suppressed for women, and society brainwashed them into believing they were dirty and ashamed, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting and that women's bodies are disgusting in preparation for bearing children, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think that way. You have never experienced it, and you will never experience it. So, how do you know men? Don't forget the burden and ignorance. This kind of attitude is not good when facing your mother. How is it good to think about your own children?
Finally, give the hygiene toilet paper a try, it's really useful.
Today is the winter solstice, a disappointing gift-giving occasion

Is the electricity leaking from the bathtub faucet?
Choosing the right bathtub can have great therapeutic benefits for your feet. Today, NBS will provide an answer to this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs have become increasingly popular among consumers. A large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan. This has given consumers a lot of choice.
In the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs sold well, but bathtubs do not have special industry standards, so there is a certain safety risk.
Swimming in electrified water is really too dangerous!
Mr. Li told reporters that he bought a bathtub as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father soaked his feet in the bathtub, he felt that his feet were itchy.
Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub at first, but it turned out that the vibration function was turned off. His father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Lee tried using an electric pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. He was shocked to find that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
Afterwards, he contacted the merchants, and their attitude was still good. Although they had withdrawn the bathtub, Mr. Lee still felt uneasy.
Because he found that the long-established bathtub, which has been popular for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature setting, suitable for which group of people, which material is safe and so on.
However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to electrical problems, but it is not impossible for some products to have loose connections during production.
Therefore, choose a freestanding bathtub when purchasing.
Hydropower separation, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a pen to write.
The 13th Provincial Tea Festival opened - Viewpoint - Hubei Daily
Hunan Daily, December 10 report (Reporter: Zhang Shaowu, Photographer: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hubei Tea Industry Expo and the New Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hubei International Expo Center. The tea industry, tea science and technology, tea culture, and the tea industry’s goal of surpassing RMB100 billion in output were showcased.
Hu Shulin, Deputy Director of the Executive Committee of the China National Association for the Promotion of Supply Chain Management, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Lv Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a keynote speech. He emphasized that the source of Huanghe is new, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into "Five-color Huanghe Tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the billion-dollar Chaoshan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three mountains and five colors tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have increased their vitality. The main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, which has driven up the income of tea farmers.
With the changing of the seasons, the red tea gains new vitality.
Tea industry experts in the province said that picking green tea and picking red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is on the rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders granted the use of “Hunan Red Tea” trademark to the fourth batch of enterprises that won the right to use the trademark, and launched the new brand “Lake Red Source”.
In the new tea exhibition hall, the tea merchants of Fujian Province immediately placed an order for a high mountain tea called “Icy Spring”.
Wang Qinghua, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the tea market is affected by various factors such as the epidemic. However, from the scene of the tea fair, there are many bright spots.
A splash of red tea, injected with tea culture connotations, people are enthusiastic and the tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it, because there is no parking space below, so he failed to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through sensory perception.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.

Ding Zilong: A friend in need is a friend indeed.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian aid over the past 30-plus years, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal in my name to domestic and foreign friends in the early 1990s, which has not been interrupted to this day.
Nowadays, the vast majority of survivors' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become independent.
Your generosity has helped us through some of our darkest moments.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping across the globe, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I humbly request that you stop giving humanitarian aid to us, the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian aid activity should have been perfected a long time ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your sacrifice will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of providing humanitarian aid, Amnesty International and the Minneapolis-based China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the implementers of projects often cross over.
(Apple Daily Photo: Tiananmen Mothers website managed by craftsmen.)
Aid often fails to reach those who need it most.
In 1994, at the suggestion of her teacher, a special group called "Tiananmen Mothers" was established to coordinate and be responsible for the collection and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the "6.4 Orphans Education Fund", and 11 years later, in 2009, after all the 6.4 orphans graduated from college, MCDF set up the "6.4 Orphans Hard-to-Care-For Elderly Assistance Fund" and has been implementing it to this day.
The funding for these projects primarily comes from donations made by alumni and the community during the 2011 earthquake, individual generous donations, and support from the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the survivors of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong, which was raised in the name of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
During this period, China Human Rights was independently implementing its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called for a stop to the 6.4 donation is for the donor to consider. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding’s letter of “friend”.
We will respect the decisions of the heirs, terminate the project within two years, and restore it immediately if necessary.
We express our gratitude and respect to those selfless heroes who have been delivering humanitarian aid at great risk for many years.

Thank you for your comment. I originally thought that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but it turned out to be too beautiful when it was produced.
Thank you, Dandong, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can give us the power to move forward, and we will continue to strive!
This photography studio is really amazing! I strongly recommend all my partners to come here!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is no room for error.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous and will customize makeup for you based on your style, and the makeup products are also huge brand names.
Tian Liang teacher no longer need to say, photography is quite a professional.
The whole office has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and the good movie theaters in Beijing need to be booked in advance for half a year. My colleague has watched movies in Beijing and felt that they were just so-so.
He deliberately sought out this office, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we feel that this is a common problem among most people. Photographers will take pictures and record natural moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production design, a great team.
When we come of age, we and those around us cannot stop praising.
I have already recommended Huang Mi to you, and Huang Mi has also watched the bottom film and is also very happy.
I hope that such a workshop will not be buried, and more people will find Ta, shoot out their own style instead of thousands of rules.

If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have these ideas, it's better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to break into this industry, training is definitely a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-control and those who are weak. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose to self-study, but it will be very tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing to do.
First, we need to look at the teaching force of this institution. If the teaching force is not strong enough, then this training institution is meaningless. Of course, some new training institutions do not have strong teaching forces.
"Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is advisable to investigate the institution and its students. After all, only the students of the institution can know how good or bad the institution is, and whether the courses are good or not."
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't provided any information about your own situation, which is related to learning this thing and your personal situation.
For example, your profession, age, the language you want to learn, even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have graduated from a computer-related field, my personal suggestion is to self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are quite good. However, the cost of learning is high and the time investment is considerable. You need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
However, if I were to say these situations, self-study would be very convenient. Nowadays, there are many learning resources on the internet that are free, and there are also many training resources on Baidu. If you can't find resources, you can contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some relatively classic books that can be combined with video to learn.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way of learning is not very tiring, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. In addition, there are people who specialize in answering questions, and there is also help in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions nowadays will sign employment contracts with a certain salary, and will recommend students to companies after their studies, so that the interview process for finding a job can be avoided.
These are my opinions based on the information provided. As I mentioned earlier, I don't have enough information about your situation to provide a detailed analysis. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I said one point before, I saw it in the App

Although crystal chandeliers are beautiful, they will become dull if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they emit colorful light, just like in life.
Success comes from doing things with heart, shaping things with meticulousness, and stitching together our seriousness.
Give me a chance and I will make you satisfied, quality is my guarantee for everything because your trust is my biggest encouragement!
Nowadays, all industries are in trouble!
"But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persistence and effort, I will be better than others, at least than those who complain all the time!"
The plan for the day begins in the morning, and all the beauty starts from the morning. Hope you start the new day with happiness, luck, health, and everything goes well. Have a good day.
In childhood, happiness is something to possess; in adulthood, happiness is a goal to achieve; in maturity, happiness is a state of mind to realize.
Be the most sincere and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and there will be no regrets in this life; life has only one path, take your own path; the two greatest treasures in life are good health and a positive attitude, and they will keep you looking and feeling young!
Every stage of life presents different challenges.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it head-on.
If it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it directly.
The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be overwhelmed; but if you face difficulties head-on, the problem will eventually solve itself.
China and Saudi Arabia will jointly hold the first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh December 12 wire (Reporter: Wang Haizhou, Hu Guang) The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Dhahran Biennial of Contemporary Art opened to the public on the 11th in the JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.
The biennale is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Urumqi, China. Tian Fengyu, Director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serves as the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform policies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, as well as reflecting the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
The exhibition spans nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings showcasing six units: "Touching Stones Across the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Going Public", "Beautiful New World", and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works in this exhibition, including painting, installation and performance art, etc. in various forms. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted a lot of attention. Some artists use recycled materials in innovative ways to create their works, such as Xu Beidong’s “The Endless Story Series: Xishan Mountain” (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Bakri, the chief executive officer of the Doha Exhibition and Convention Foundation, said that he hopes this biennale can establish an international dialogue, so that global audiences can have the opportunity to understand the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction.
Tian Fei Yu said, "The goal of the biennale is double-edged. It can enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and also enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the two-year exhibition period. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Unified standards for rural public interest positions - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12 wire (Reporter: Lin Bifeng) To continue to provide employment assistance to eradicate poverty, consolidate and expand the achievements of eradicating poverty, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public interest positions in rural revitalization to help promote the comprehensive advancement of rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, at present, Yunnan Province has developed a total of 448,300 public interest positions in rural areas, which are used for employment of poverty-stricken farmers and other rural disadvantaged groups. They play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to achieve income growth, consolidate the achievements of eradicating poverty, effectively improve the ability of various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan People's Congress, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc. It mainly provides unified norms for the scope of recruiting rural public interest personnel, fund management, position development, position management, etc.
In terms of position development setting, the new regulations are clear, and are set up according to the principles of "need-based deployment, position-based recruitment, dynamic management, total control" "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person one post, voluntary openness, unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of advertisement, application, screening, publicity, appointment, pre-employment training, and arrangement of posting.
In addition, the new regulations have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the main departments responsible for the development of rural public interest positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public interest positions, and have stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public interest positions should purchase commercial liability insurance for the placement of rural public interest position personnel. The relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the subsidies for rural public interest positions.

Hello.
Can I cancel my order?
I will place a new order.
Has it been cancelled?
"Although the right wing had its golden age in history, it did not last long, so it was short-lived because giving people sunshine makes them shine, and giving them water makes them sweat; if they were ambitious, they would be humiliated."
But in fact, the right wing has played an active role in social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of ending the definition of truth by the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection.
As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei's statements, I am very interested in his statements and also very respectful of Li Wei as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes social issues in China seriously.
But I oppose his counter-revolutionary theory, I believe that counter-revolution is unnecessary and will inevitably lead to social turbulence, damage to people's livelihoods, political groups disintegrating, and foreign intervention.
Fourth, changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and the people. Political schemers who attempt to take advantage of the situation are not the right wing, but the confused.
Let's talk about something else.
Left, in fact, are the orphans of time and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their thoughts when necessary, so the left will not have this problem, because the left wants to throw away the garbage that the Communist Party throws away!
5. Recently, I've seen some of my friends behaving in a contradictory and hypocritical manner, and even getting angry, which is unnecessary.
Don't try to argue with a hysteric or a leftist, they're both irrational and can't be reasoned with.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to convince the fools and the leftists, why bother?
This is what I tell my friends: when the anti-fascists call you a fascist, when the anarchists call you a cop, it proves that our middle way is the right way!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but as they grew older, they forgot about their dreams or pursued them, only to become obsessed.
And ideal gradually fades away, even the young dragon becomes a monster.
To me, left and right generally refers to constraints and freedom. From the perspective of historical and cultural genes, China should be left-leaning as a whole.
Domestically, the right wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens regulation and focuses more on fairness and safety.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the US are competing with each other, and the left is definitely winning. It is estimated that it will take many years to continue.
Although it's hard to understand, just give a thumbs up and it's done.
What else is there to say, it's just a figure of speech
For nearly two years, the US embargo and blockade of Huawei’s chips have not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented crisis, but also caused enormous losses to the “American” enterprises.
The US pressure on China's semiconductor industry requires domestic enterprises and allied enterprises to block our country's semiconductor industry at the same time, which directly leads to the impact of global semiconductor suppliers' orders and profits, resulting in reduced research and development investment of semiconductor production enterprises, reduced production capacity, and shortages of the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, "shortages" have spread to major industries worldwide, such as automobile production, mobile phone price increases, and almost all industries that use chips are affected.
In order to grasp the sovereignty of "chips", more and more countries' technology giants are moving towards the path of "going global".
In order to tighten control over the global semiconductor industry, dominate the development of China's semiconductor industry, the US frequently takes action, and is also the main organizer of the "Semiconductor Summit", as well as inviting the heads of 64 countries to establish the Semiconductor Alliance and raise funds to support US domestic technology giants such as Intel, which spent US$2 billion to build two semiconductor fabs in Arizona, USA, to regain its leading position in the semiconductor industry.
Most people believe that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and may even steal TSMC's "lunch."
The reason why it is so confident is because Intel, as a technology giant in the semiconductor industry, has been digging in the semiconductor sector for decades, and has a large number of talented teams and technical reserves. It must be able to quickly rise and beat TSMC in the short term.
However, for Intel's decision, Zhang Zhidong, the founder of Tsinghua Tongfang, did not hesitate.
At the “2021 CEO Summit” held in April this year, Zhang Zhiduo made a shocking statement. He openly criticized Intel’s investment in the crystal plant, saying that Intel’s foundry plant was a laughing matter.
Zhang Zhiduo is quite reluctant for Intel to enter the Jade Computing Area. This is because Zhang Zhiduo still harbors a grudge against Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the crown jewel of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the top spot in the global semiconductor market and dominating the world of semiconductors.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a few strong players.
At that time, the semi-conductor industry was characterized by IDM mode. Chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model is too burdensome for some small businesses. Many semi-conductor entrepreneurs can only hope and step for the huge production line construction cost.
In response to market demand, in the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to emerge with the phenomenon of subcontracting and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zidong heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it would be possible to establish a factory specializing in crystal manufacturing.
Not long after, Zhang Zhidong's dream became a reality, and Taitong Power was born.
Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper, reported that Guangzhou Power Supply Company has targeted the "crystal processing" sector as its main business. It does not offer design services, but only provides crystal manufacturing subcontracting services.
At the time of its founding, Tsingtao Brewery was a small player in the face of the giant Unilever.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhiduo once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that Tsingtao would only engage in the manufacturing sector of the semiconductor industry, it obviously had too high an opinion of itself and refused to invest in Tsingtao.
Zhang Zhidong also believes that Intel at that time did not attach importance to the crystal round process service.
He did not expect that the giant of crystal glass manufacturing service at that time will also start to make crystal glasses.
So Zhang Zhidong felt that Intel's entry into the smart glasses market was very ironic.
Today, the market value of Tesla has already surpassed Intel.
Faced with the strong offensive of Tesla, Intel is also reluctant to stand firm.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has already moved to the 3nm process node, while Intel still remains at the 14nm process node that was introduced 7 years ago.
It's not easy to exceed expectations.
Don't wait.

Today, let's take a look at some strange hot searches.
What is the normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: Dragon Boat Festival in February, the rise in the price of good friends, and the Gala event. Public opinion peaks and then [indices decline] (smooth curve) to finally dissipate, and if a second generation of public opinion emerges, a small bump will reappear.
They look almost identical to the "Internet Sentiment Dynamics Model" displayed on the website of the Internet Information Office.
What is an exceptional mood?
Randomly select six hotspots from the same event and display them as [peak], [notch], and [cliff].
【孤峰状】 refers to human-caused heating, rapid rise to the top of the hot search list, attracting public attention;【锯齿状】 refers to cyclical heating, ensuring that the topic rises to the top of the hot search list;【断崖状】 refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search fulfilling its “function” and receiving a new task, moving towards a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is only a few seconds. It must be that the unified water army received the mission and started the new offensive.
It can be seen from the professionalism of Black Publicity that dozens of hot topics are listed at the same time. Which ones are eye-catching, which ones are responsible for science and technology, which ones are provocative, which ones divert people's attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, which ones affect decision-making, which ones are used to divide accounts, which ones are used to divide nodes, and almost all elements are considered in terms of the spread and dissemination of public opinion.
Journalism is a science, and objectivity, neutrality, and impartiality should be upheld. Subjectivity, emotions, and personal opinions should be set aside, and only objective data should be reported.
Anyone who passes by will leave a trace, let's dig it up together.

On the 10th day of the month, Mauritius reported two cases of opioid drug infection for the first time.
According to the Minister of Health, Kgalema Motlanthe, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other is a local resident, who tested positive for the virus on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the two patients' HIV test results turned negative, and they have returned to their respective homes.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed its first three cases of COVID-19 infection.
These three people are students. They returned from overseas travel earlier this month due to mild symptoms and have not been hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the opioid epidemic, the Seychelles government has been increasing its efforts to control it.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, 12-year-old and above passengers arriving by air will be required to self-pay for nuclear acid testing at the airport.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health also announced that it will begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
On the 9th, Zambia's Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya said that the country had discovered its first three cases of HIV-infected patients.
The health department of the country conducted genetic sequencing of the 12 new coronavirus samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these three cases of infection.

At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to spend 70,000 yuan for the basic renovation.
A series of scams began as soon as they entered the store.
"I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't even go to the site to measure the house. They told me my 135 sqm house was worth 700,000 yuan, which I thought was reasonable. I didn't even know what brand of material they were using."
Their second scam is that as soon as you walk into the store, they will try to pressure you into giving them your money (and this money is gone once you give it to them, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I hesitated to pay the deposit, they invited their so-called manager to tell me that they could offer me a discount if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big hole, and I am a living example of being deceived. In the heat of the moment, I signed away more than a thousand fixed deposits.
There are many issues with the price he gave me. It does not include the cost of water and electricity renovation, nor any doors or cupboards in the bathroom, all of which are included in the basic cost.
Their service fees are higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and I will not sign a contract until everything is clear from the beginning.
When I went to collect their money, they looked very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
Regardless, it is the customer's problem and they are fully responsible.
There are various responsibilities, as well as many details, and I don't want to talk about them one by one. In short, don't choose them because the houses they renovated for my friends were of poor quality, and they charged various fees afterward.
Father, they are the heads of the original scammers, but now they are decorated as beauties and seem to have changed again.
Therefore, do not choose such a dirty construction company.
In the future, when everyone is choosing, many people will look up these consultations on Baidu because decoration is not cheap.

Taurid meteor shower to peak on November 14 - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin December 12 wire (Reporter: Zhou Rongjian) Astronomy enthusiasts said that as the last major meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, which is one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will peak on December 14. Friends who love meteor showers can observe after midnight on the night of the 14th.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu captured a twin-tailed meteor shower in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers come from periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid of the Apollo type.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not caused by a comet "pregnancy."
Tianjin City Astronomical Society Chairman and astronomy expert Yi Xuejian said that, just like the appearance of the meteor shower in the congratulatory film, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. The “peak period” can be from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its high flow rate and stability, and is called the Northern Hemisphere's three major meteor showers along with the Geminid meteor shower and the Ursid meteor shower.
One significant feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids have slow speeds, rich colors, and many fireballs, making them suitable for both viewing and photography by amateur astronomers.
Yang Ying, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, captured a twin-tailed meteor shower in Tianjin Tangshan on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts indicate that this year's Geminid meteor shower will peak on December 14th at around 15:00, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate) of 150.
Zodiac sign meteor shower recommendations chart.
Last year's Geminid meteor shower, the "shooting stars," left a deep impression on people. However, this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the degree of splendor will be reduced.
On the 14th day of the 11th month of the Lunar Calendar, the moon phase is waning, and the bright moonlight will cause interference to observation. The moon will set after midnight, and the radiation point of the Geminid Meteor Shower will rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who enjoy shooting stars can observe for a few hours after the moonrise in the later half of the night, but be sure to dress warmly.
How can we observe more shooting stars?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with a high altitude, small light pollution, facing northeast, and then patiently wait for the moon to set, and then observe.
It should be noted that the outflow of T Tauri stars in each direction is very large, and it is not necessary to observe the radiation point of the T Tauri star continuously during observation.
If you're a photography enthusiast and want to capture stunning "shooting star" photos, it's best to use a wide-angle and large aperture lens, and to use high ISO and the maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, three-legged stands, backup batteries, and power cords are also indispensable.

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the questioner should be understood as a liquid crystal TV, and the difference in market position between plasma TV and liquid crystal TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus on the large screen market.
Compared with the fully open market position of LCD TVs, laser TVs obviously focus on the large screen market, or can be said to be a product born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream liquid crystal TV sizes range from 55 to 65 inches, while the sizes of plasma TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large screen TVs.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Counterpoint's prediction, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and will continue to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for the good performance in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of the laser TV in protecting the eyes.
Based on the principle of laser TV imaging, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
The Shaoxi Experimental Laboratory of China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts of Beijing Union and Hospital conducted a strict comparison test under the same viewing conditions for laser TV and liquid crystal TV, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data verification: Laser TVs do indeed have very strong eye protection features, and in some cases, even have certain improvement effects.
As vision health becomes increasingly important, laser TV not only attracts more users with its eye protection advantage, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus on the high-end market.
In contrast to the declining prices of liquid crystal TVs, the prices of laser TVs in the market are mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of screen size and light source, the prices gradually increase.
Why is the plasma TV so expensive?
It is definitely reasonable.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, plasma and projection TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs cannot achieve.
Based on super short throw projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection devices. It can achieve a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, and the required space is small, and the host is small and compact.
In terms of brightness, large brand plasma TVs can reach over 2000 nits.
In addition, with lower heat generation and less device damage, the life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also come with a variety of cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and synthetic screens, which can provide users with more shocking visual and audio experiences.
Don't talk about pseudo-demands, but about the differentiated products based on the needs. Talk about the picture quality and input-output ratio. The plasma TV is not a dish for audiovisual players. If you want to consider both large screen and viewing environment, you can try. There are pros and cons for everything. Weigh the pros and cons and make your own judgment.
In simple terms, the super-wide angle near-focus projector - laser TV - in order to approach the screen, had to use expensive super-wide angle lenses and reflective mirrors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block some of the ambient light, use a micro-structured Fresnel lens, which is expensive, and you can replace a 65-inch LCD with an 80-inch one.
Another point, I particularly dislike the projection theater merchants touting the good point of anti-glare reflection for the eyes. The light on the screen that the eyes can see is actually direct light. If you reflect it onto the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. The liquid crystal TV is also "reflected" in this way. Is the ceiling not illuminated when you open the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not anti-glare, the image will be unrecognizable.
The hot spot (flare) effect of the high contrast screen is often overlooked. At a certain angle, a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes, which is really troublesome.
Shanghai Visual Art Photography Museum selects high-quality shops. Temporarily there is no branch
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the lady sent me the available time slots, and the response was quite timely.
Before entering the store, I had a look at the shooting works in the store. There were more outdoor wedding photos. The photos were beautiful and the shooting styles were many.
After the day was over, I simply chatted with her about my thoughts, and she patiently helped me try two different styles of clothes that I had knitted. In the end, we agreed on a makeup and styling concept, and the photographer set up props and guided us through the details.
However, it is possible that because we did not exchange specific shooting ideas, the footage is not in the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select photos, exchange post-production styles, and feel quite meticulous.
It takes about half a month to get used to it.
Secondly, there will be a photo session for the Emperor's Banquet. Most of the clothes will be able to choose one photo.
In the end, she chose a black dress and experienced different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is a 95-year-old brother. He is a little bit young, so I hope to give more advice in guiding the customer's action in the future. The shooting process was quite happy.
Shanghai Film and Visual Arts Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store
"Go to the top page, come and look at Queenie~"
Fill in your name and phone number at the store before trying on clothes, and you can choose from a variety of wedding dresses. You can try on up to three or four sets of clothes before deciding, and the staff are very patient. After choosing your dress, the staff will teach you how to pose for photos, and you will receive the photos within a month or so. It feels almost the same as the original, and the staff are very professional.
【环境】整体还好。
There is a lot of optional clothing.
There are only three makeup stations, and they are located next to the photo booth.
【Service】is very enthusiastic and also very meticulous.
A stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the moves.
If dissatisfied, the photographer will also proactively offer retouching.
【Experience】The makeup is a bit too much, the original double eyelid has been glued with three eyelids.
The eyebrows have also been trimmed, which is a bit awkward for those who don't usually wear makeup.
I received the photos in 10 days, but I am not satisfied with the P effect. It feels like the eyelid pads are too obvious.
Because it was not clear what style to choose, she tried two sets and the results were quite different. In the end, she chose a black suit and said that this set was quite retro.
After choosing clothes, we began to do makeup and hairstyle. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient in helping me, and the result was very satisfactory.
I did my makeup and then started taking photos. The photographer directed me the whole time and it was very easy and comfortable.
After finishing watching, he carefully selected four of his favorite scenes and said that he would make a movie within 15 days. The ending was very satisfactory.
It has been 3 days and there has been no response... Due to your system being unable to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
I have to pay shipping every time now.
Can you waive the fees first, and then collect my monthly fees after your investigation?
Should I buy insurance for my umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Revision), to become an insurance broker, it must meet three key words: shareholders, founders have no major illegal records in the past three years, minimum capital of RMB 50 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three requirements are quite stringent. In summary, it means that the insurance company must have strength, must be approved by the national regulatory department of the Insurance Association (regulates insurance companies throughout the country), the shareholders must have a good reputation, be a small umbrella insurance for the insurance agency, and the insured must not have too many doubts about whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not. These three requirements are not something that any insurance company can achieve.
On this point, it is also good and reliable.
In terms of insurance products, Little Umbrella Insurance is like an insurance supermarket, where many companies' celebrity endorsed high risk products are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched and Thai-super Maha 5, where the insured and the insurer are Thai Life Insurance. Little Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no reason to doubt its credibility.
From the perspective of the payment model: Internet platform products, because of the reduced operating expenses of the business points and the cost of business staff salaries, have a relatively high price competitiveness, and flexible payment methods that support monthly payments, reduce the burden of insurance premium payments, and can maximize the leveraging of insurance.
This is also very good.
Consider.
From the perspective of professionalism, this is particularly important because insurance is a highly professional industry that requires a high level of expertise. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which can lead to a lot of misconceptions, especially in the areas of health notification and employment. Non-insurance professionals often add their subjective opinions when insuring, feeling healthy or compliant, which can lead to a lot of claims denial risks.
I have done insurance phone sales for “Tencent Weibo” (similar to Alibaba’s online insurance brokerage platform) and I am very responsible, telling everyone.
The insurance of the Internet is real, but also relies on luck. The unreliable part is people. The Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many sales deceptions.
For example, 1 yuan of insurance can protect 6 million. Buy insurance and get 60,000 yuan of heavy illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are evasive. They do not tell the insured that the first month is free, and the second month is charged according to the normal fee. More than 30 to 200 yuan. Many customers do not understand why they have been charging for a year or two.
The insurance company paid 6 million yuan in compensation.
Free delivery of mobile phones is only for special order numbers such as 6666 and 8888 at the end of the order, and there is no one to remind you if you win the lottery.
For the insured, this is a double-edged sword. Free coverage of up to 60,000 yuan for critical illness is short-term. If relying solely on this, there is no other commercial risk. If a critical illness occurs, 60,000 yuan is not enough to solve the problem, and future life will be in trouble.
Currently, the state is also severely cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, in summary, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the staff.
It is suggested that the subject should carefully consider the overall situation. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies offer a wider range of products for customers to choose from, and some products have better value than online products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, ensured offline products, and promised to save each person 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am Mingya, a licensed insurance agent with over three years of experience in enterprise management training. I have served nearly a thousand enterprise users and collaborated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before providing insurance, I will customize insurance products based on the needs of the customer. During the insurance process, I will strive to win the best nuclear protection result for the customer. After providing insurance, I will arrange the insurance policy for the customer and manage the insurance policy.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the topic!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business where the insured can independently complete all the insurance procedures after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, the insurance advisor does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured person independently.
Although there is no "ceremony" in Internet insurance, and even the printed paper contract may not exist, it does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract at all.
This model is somewhat similar to the normal flow of telephone sales, but buying insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the subsequent service may not be up to par.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we purchase insurance, should we not carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "life insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us in many years to come?

Refund the discount code and you can
No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange for the return, I have already bought elsewhere, I don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and abuse, and I cannot tolerate such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this scourge.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized behavior.
Since you started sending friend requests on Facebook, publishing provocative posts, and attempting to publish my purported home address and father's name on social media, I have taken an unresponsive attitude.
You persistently tag me even after we broke up, and your so-called friends continue to discuss embarrassing and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook without any remorse. They talk about my appearance, height, good manners, and even discuss whether to add me as a friend or not. I've had enough.
How do I know that later on, many of my friends sent me a Facebook friend request with a photo and sexually harassing comments about you?
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported the news of the police, you did not calm down at all, but instead became more and more nervous.
I don't care about your political background or your status, it is necessary to respect both genders in our society.
Yes, you can continue to engage in provocative, evasive, humiliating, and abusive language, and you can continue to say that you only care and are concerned about me, and you can even deny that it is harassment, or continue to post all attacking comments.
That's right, I can't, and I have no power to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, my looks and physique don't need your commentary.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would be willing to be humiliated that much to get her name out there.
Friend asks me, how are you?
I say good, you won't believe.
I don't think any girl can say they're doing well after being so disrespected.
Only those who lack basic morals would choose to harm a woman in such a way.
I believe that honesty comes naturally to people.
I left some comments for everyone to review.
Your post should not be copied by anyone.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major conferences were held during the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, discussing topics ranging from digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation to digital technology enterprises and the economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, although the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread, the number and revenue of Vietnam’s digital technology enterprises still maintained growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has focused on cultivating digital products, concentrating on solving major problems faced by Vietnam, and many digital products have been exported. Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Manh Hung called on digital technology enterprises to shoulder the responsibility of developing the national digital transformation platform, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is the responsibility of the state.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state agencies are studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology enterprises, organizations, and individuals to share and mobilize all social resources to develop Vietnam's technology enterprises, to promote the country's digital transformation, and to overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery.
At the forum, Premier Li Keqiang emphasized that digital transformation is a must for the world and is an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are available to the entire population, so it is necessary to mobilize the entire population to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and the enterprises.
Premier Li Keqiang emphasized that digital transformation should embody national spirit and should be mainly driven by internal factors such as strategy, long-term and decisive factors, while external factors should be important and breakthrough-oriented.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation should be driven towards deep development and sustainable development, and should participate in the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic, economic recovery and development, addressing its after-effects, overcoming the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and promoting green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases related to the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, and national folk customs, as well as the promotion of digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management, and logistics.
The main goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Premier Li Keqiang has requested that governments at all levels, government agencies, and enterprises increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise their awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises based on the spirit of respect, communication, listening, active and proactive.
During the forum, Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the 2021 “Made in Vietnam” Excellent Digital Product Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the “Made in Vietnam” Digital Product Exhibition.

“智汇潇湘”2021中国国际轨道交通和装备制造产业人才峰会开幕
Hunan Daily, December 10 news (Reporter: Zhou Xiang) On the 9th, the 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit “Smart Huizhou” was opened in Huzhou.
Wang Cheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and head of the Provincial Organization Department attended the opening ceremony and delivered a keynote speech.
Wang Cheng pointed out that hosting the Talent Summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the 12th CPC National Congress and the 12th Provincial Congress, and it reflects Hubei’s sincere heart in valuing talent, pursuing talent and using talent.
Hunan has a long-standing tradition of valuing talent, providing a broad platform for talent development, and creating favorable environmental conditions for achieving a good life. In recent years, it has implemented a talent-led development strategy, using the Flower Program as a lure, constructing a talent retention and utilization work pattern, and becoming a fertile soil for talent growth, a hotbed for innovation and entrepreneurship, and an attractive place for residence and employment.

The Yangtze River Delta has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11 wire (Reporter Wang Jian) Chongqing Fuling Shuiquan Green Comprehensive Service District was officially put into operation on the 10th day of the month. This is the second water-based green comprehensive service district in the upstream of the Yangtze River after Chongqing Fuling Shuiquan Green Comprehensive Service District was officially put into operation on the 8th day of the month.
Up to now, the green comprehensive service area on water has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
According to Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of Jianghuai Administration Bureau of Ministry of Transport, previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces and cities have set up 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by a large number of boatmen, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the inland waterway green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the green shipping on the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River ship and boat pollutant reception and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides all-round production and life services for a large number of ships and crew, and helps a large number of seafarers solve the problem of "urgent difficulties and worries".
Two water-based green comprehensive service areas will be built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They will integrate living services, production services and public services into one, with green environmental protection as the main theme, and boat repair and emergency rescue services for boats as the characteristic. This will achieve "one-stop docking and multiple services" for boats in the Yangtze River, making the work of the crew more efficient and convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China. The strongest weapons in the US arsenal are rare to visit Guam. 2022-01-17 多维 亲中共媒体多维报道：中美关系最新消息：最新卫星图像显示，美国三艘航母正在中国周边集结；美媒还披露，美国海军武器库中最强大的武器之一罕见访问关岛，对印太地区美国的盟友与敌手释放重要信号。
According to the Chinese think tank “South Sea Strategic Situation Intelligence Platform”, on January 9, a satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands.
The Panama Canal connects the South Sea and the Caribbean Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to be sent to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has deployed F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Osprey" transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is also sailing in the Pacific.
Lincoln also hosted the first F-35C squadron, belonging to the US Marine Corps' 314th Marine Expeditionary Unit.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is stationed in Yokosuka, Japan, is also currently deployed by the US Navy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shanghai Lake", the missile destroyer "Stockholm", and so on.
On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering in the vicinity of China.
(Weibo@南海战略态势感知) On January 17, 2022, the US Navy's CMV-22B transport aircraft flew over Guam, the most powerful weapon in the world.
(Weibo@南海战略态势感知) According to CNN's report on January 17, one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Russian nuclear submarine "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The USS Ronald Reagan, the USS Nimitz, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the three aircraft carriers of the US Navy, have gathered in the waters around China. It is rare for such powerful weapons to visit Guam. Analysts believe that this is a signal sent to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit since the 1980s.
The USS Ronald Reagan, the USS Nimitz, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the three aircraft carriers of the US Navy, have gathered in the waters around China. It is rare to see such powerful weapons visiting Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
It is meant to be China's version of Hawaii in the South China Sea.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that Russia's nuclear submarine "Narwhal" visit to the island strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and regional allies, demonstrated U.S. capability, flexibility, readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called the "thunder submarine" (Boomer submarine).
The whereabouts of 14 of the US Navy submarines are usually kept strictly confidential.
Around the secret of the ballistic missile submarine, the "Thunderball submarine" became the most important survival weapon among the nuclear triad. The system also includes land-based ballistic missile silos in the United States and bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent Meta drop of 26%, its market value of $251 billion, and Zuckerberg's response of "facing unprecedented competition", why?
Meta（原 Facebook）实际上是一家广告公司，收入主要来自广告，今天今日赚钱的广告公司，自己拥有流量渠道。
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and so on, no matter what kind of positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest “advertising alliance”. Many apps externalize Meta’s advertising and achieve profit through Meta’s advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly and clearly indicates whether the user allows the app to access their information, with the majority of people's normal response being to not allow it.
Following this, if Google were to make another attempt, the impact on Meta's revenue would be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta does not have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta gets at least 10% of its annual revenue from China, mainly from companies that make maritime business contributions in China.
Meta has several hundred employees in its Hong Kong office and several dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an indispensable advertising channel. Most of the money is spent on Meta.
Interestingly, TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from TT in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping to promote the advertisement at the WordCamp. The performance of the Meta Greater China region is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The era of Chinese companies spending heavily overseas is over.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms including TikTok are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of expected growth.
The capital market is not only about current income, but more importantly about future expectations.
It is quite obvious that Meta's expectations were not met.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talked about "the Metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support Meta's market capitalization in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
Don't look now, but Facebook is in big trouble. It's annual revenue runs from $10 billion to $20 billion, but it's actually in crisis mode compared to other internet companies and high tech firms. It has no moat.
Although his several social media apps are now quite popular and mainstream, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, he has no confidence in the face of TikTok's rapid development, and the gap between them is only a matter of time.
Facebook is very dangerous, and that's why Mark Zuckerberg changed his name and keeps looking for new tracks. But I think his track selection is wrong, it's a wrong path.
