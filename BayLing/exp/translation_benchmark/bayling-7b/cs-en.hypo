The big comeback of the Czech smolka is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
The Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who is going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 30-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon find himself in the goal.
Former goalie of Litvinov, Plzen or Russian Chelyabinsk, was injured in the preparation for the NHL in October last year.
Exactly halfway through the game against Vegas, he was benched and has not played in the NHL since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was transferring from one post to another.
Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury, the Denver-based team announced at the beginning of October.
His return to action in the NHL was eventually stretched out over more than two months.
On Sunday afternoon U.S. time, he was called up from the farm where he had caught four ducks and showed his old form.
V AHL, however, 94.5% of votes were cast.
The Pilsen hockey player wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had problems with his ankles in the last season and missed one game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles puts Camilla in a Santa hat, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan for their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also shared his own wishes, using a photograph of his wife, Camilla, helping to pin a veil in place.
British broadcaster the BBC reported this on its website.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues and benefactors, with whom they collaborate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki colour and Princess Charlotte also has the same dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt just like Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not reveal, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
The royal family posed for a Christmas card photo shoot in a straw bale pile in front of a forest of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas card, was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the moment in June at Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her coloured veil with a light dress.
Slavia promised Berbró a million for the title, says Tvrdík.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked on the assumption that the former chairman of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, had promised Slavia Prague a million crowns for winning the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz that he had received part of the police files.
Chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and white did not engage in any corrupt activities.
The server published transcripts of police wiretaps, in which Slavia features mainly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who was dismissed from the club in the summer.
The former influential functionary of the red and white movement was in frequent contact, according to the records, not only with Berber, but also with the former sports director of the then second league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminalists are said to have worked with information that Slavia Prague promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
Police had noted that Roman (Berbr) had received a million-crown bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the police report.
According to the criminalists, Berbr later met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors.
It is not clear from the police register whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík any kind of corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the ratio in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in any unlawful actions, we have not tried to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided any financial compensation to anyone in this context, Tvrdík said on Seznam Zprávy.
In his post-match comments, Nezmar, among other things, unreservedly abused some of the former Slavia dark-haired players and also praised his former boss Tvrdík.
Kauzu údajného ovlivňování zápasů prostřednictvím rozhodčích započala polovinu října policejní zásah na několika místech, včetně pražského sídla FAČR.
The highest profile casualty of the scandal is Berba, who is no longer involved in any football-related activities.
In mid-January, the same as the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and submarines are LARPing the Cold War.
Guns will be new but of a worse type (artillerymen will have to leave the armoured cab and carry the shells manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Tanks and various armoured vehicles - at an acceptable level, moreover it has been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialist units.
Aircraft: combat-capable, but on the verge of retirement, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few types with combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export them abroad)
PVO: medium - interwar, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have that story.
Honitbu mam hned vedle města.
I was sitting on the bank of the river, eating nuts and damaging crops.
When I arrived, I saw a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to run a brothel, so I just sat quietly and typed away.
I thought he was going to leave, but of course the fox came out.
I took her to 40 metres before I decided to shoot.
The fisherman, Chudák, almost got away, but I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got out of the estate I was fucked.
In other words, the man's wife is a prostitute.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a series of coincidences for something to happen, probably something you would see on a thermal imaging camera, which most people have nowadays.
Therefore, in a visible place, take away the things you love and put them in storage, and you will be at ease.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Internal medicine respiratory services are significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for purchasing and distributing masks, gloves and respirators for professions closest to coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their production in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared purchases made by individual ministries and discovered that during a single day the amounts spent on respirators varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices fluctuating so dramatically?
Which offices were frugal?
Why do other people shop around?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the editor of the server iRozhlas, Dominika Kubištová.
I value soldiers and the army (I am not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak army, which the older generation experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't have big warehouses of technology that the trainees could use, we don't even have modern technology for the existing professionals, and modern technology is actually more complicated, so the skills of the reserves will be rapidly lost over time.
Modern conventional conflicts, in which anyone can get involved, will take place very quickly, and there will be no time for anyone to train again.
In the end, reserves/territorial defense have great importance for the country, such as Ukraine, where it is necessary to carry out mass guerrilla and it is a clear necessity to scare the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be successful in a conflict of such scale and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography for that.
We don't have individual skills.
It's not the worst thing.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they owned it.
To pak nastává taková situace, že koukáš jak frajer, kterej 2 minuty zpátky netrefil prázdnou bránu, najíždí do útoku sám mezi 2 nebo dokonce 3 švýcarami a řikáš si "tvl a co si asi myslíš, že se teď stane?".
Of course they are taxing him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill is so terrible that I was really surprised when I saw that our attacker managed to bypass one opponent.
First butterflies
The COVID-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major turning point in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, hospitals will continue to be overwhelmed with COVID-19 for some time to come and, as is known, a new unknown variable has been added to the pandemic equation: variant Omega, which is likely to spread much faster than the current Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from a previous infection can help.
This week, however, there has also been an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
Czech Republic has a new drug, antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
Another drug, paxlovid from Pfizer, is also expected to be approved, with success rates of up to 85 percent from previous trials.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, apart from the hope of expanding the range of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the Czech administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As was said, the first to be given the drug to Czech patients will be Merck.
The company ended up on the back foot for the first time because the drug was being developed long before the current pandemic to find a cure for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often forgotten that people in the West (Germany, Sweden etc.)
They are generally less open and less likely to share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beaks have grown".
This is research that asks people whether they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West they tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them and how the Czechs are a racist nation.
This is what happens when you vote for the AfD.
We are afraid of cancelling culture, saying this to the public means losing your job and media lynching.
Pakistan looks heavy in the surveys, west good, east bad.
And find out what people really think.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20% according to the poll.
We know that the objects are identical in Czech.
Identical for the reason that companies are rotated so that soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, so all the buildings look the same.
One is the Atomic Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Sranda je, že sssr nechtělo mít na vlastním území nukleární hlavice ať už z důvodu bezpečnosti nebo rychlosti nasazení hlavic z důvodu západnější polohy.
In these underground shelters (there are two in every oak tree) only the heads of the rockets were stored, not the complete missiles as they are called.
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit was dispatched, which retrieved the warhead and mounted it onto some kind of carrier.
In addition, the museum maple trees are in a state of disrepair.
At secondary school we had a classmate called Cigán, we were in the same class for four years.
He was a bit of a rogue, a bit of a rascal, but he was our mascot.
Everyone knew him, he went there a lot, he wanted to explain something, he missed a lot, he went there regularly, he was into sports with us, he didn't steal anything, not even mobile phones, he went there dressed properly.
He went to school in the country, did all sorts of odd jobs, but was happy, never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Roma children in the same class, other classes.
Shortly afterwards, the teacher was killed, the police were often called to deal with something there, they threatened and intimidated other students.
I sometimes sell something on a notice board (old things, things I don't need etc.) and I've been selling to the Gypsies for a long time, they always have money, they don't try to cheat me on the price, they communicate calmly.
Once I sold the car like that, the boy called after a month and said that he had written it off himself.
I'll tell you right now that I'm not a racist, it's one thing if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or green, as long as they act like they belong in polite society (work, function, don't hit women, just basic behaviour).
As long as someone comes, draws their hand, evicts flats and houses, there is disorder around them, they cause problems. That's one thing, but it will annoy me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants as long as they integrate, start their own businesses, work, learn a language (not necessarily English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, that's one thing, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash on Prachatice
The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts she died at the scene, said spokesperson for the South Bohemian Health Rescue Service, Zuzana Fajtlová.
The accident was probably caused by the driver of the car, who was carrying the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction of the village of Žíchovec towards the village of Bavorov and, for as yet unknown reasons, drove in the opposite direction in a bend.
As a result of the collision, the Peugeot car ended up on the roof outside the road, said spokesperson for the South Bohemian Police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple lacerations and remained trapped in the vehicle.
He had to be given urgent pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the Czech Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, said rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second vehicle suffered minor abdominal injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to tobacco products from non-EU countries, but customers often fail to provide information
Lukáš Neuheisel orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
It's usually $10 to $20, say, where it's still worth it to ship from Japan, where the postage is often free, the collector estimates.
Since October, he has seen a slight increase in the cost of ordering small parcels, which now have to include VAT and be handed over to the post for customs clearance.
He gets an email saying customs are expecting a package.
The seller needs to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the DPH did not include the trader in the sale, the customs office will charge him for the shipment and transportation from the total amount for the shipment.
If the recipient does not arrange customs clearance themselves, they must also include the carrier's fee in the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, the whole process is not complicated.
Print one or two sticky labels, add two inserts and I'm done.
For me it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisel.
However, not all deliveries are successful.
Due to new customs regulations, the number of international parcels received at the Prague post office has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 per day.
According to Czech Post, the problem is also that people are not responding to requests for information that is needed to complete customs procedures.
At the moment there are 30,000 items in the post office that need to be processed.
If people filled in all the information that is required and filled it in time, we would be here about half way through, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation solution
As for the title, how would you suggest solving the current inflation?
Currently we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What would you like me to do, according to you, to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see in Poland, for example, the reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this your way?
What if you think it will happen, what is inevitable with where it is going?
Prices will rise faster than wages, so people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is an employee)?
Last year they added 2% in gross, which is a slap on the wrist, but fortunately I have similar earnings from running the business.
Byl by mi někdo schopný vysvětlit, proč se prokazatelně usvědčení násilníci posílají za mříže třeba jenom na 6 měsíců?
This just makes my head explode, how can a judge sentence such an animal to only 6 months behind bars, just so they can do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing compared to the trauma that its victim will have for several years, which will negatively affect its sexual relationships and overall relationships.
Apart from that, the victim of rape does not have to worry that they will never be able to forget about it.
Will you investigate this and potential future reports of rape?
Man from Hrob "chased off" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from Hroby unintentionally helped the guards to secure his long-term missing girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was wanted for arrest.
He called her himself.
He did it with a click.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been mugged.
Officers who answered a 999 call to a distress line arrived at the scene and were left stunned when the "victim" told them he had made the whole thing up to get the officers to attend.
In fact, he just wanted to tell the guards how to report the incident to the Czech Police.
When checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, nationwide, and a warrant for her arrest was issued.
The case is being handled by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavs, but it would be interesting to hear your opinion.
Jinak s memem souhlasím, škoda že se Churchillovi nepovedlo zajistit osvobození Prahy USA :')
Of course we don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's a very open question whether a rational person can truly believe something without evidence just because it might potentially benefit them.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true.
Today, with Pascale, I cannot agree that in the world there are around ten thousand different religions, if we do not count the sects.
Which god or gods does a person choose then?
I'd say it's pretty likely that at least one of the thousands of religions out there has at least one god who'll smite you if you don't believe in their god.
However, in Deuteronomy 10:14, it states that there is no other God but Jehovah.
Therefore, in such a case, it would be more reasonable to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risking choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and thus sending myself to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
10 months of training (in different specializations, 10 months for one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If a man leads himself well, he can get a professional offer.
Something like this would suit everyone in the Czech Republic.
Dalo by se to dělat ve spolupráci s Univerzitou Obrany.
We can talk like this: Constant cooperation between the educational sector and industry, companies hunt in schools and there is some kind of interweaving, where the working force migrates from educational institutions to working positions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar fusion should work between the civil and military sectors.
I perceive it as a way to build some kind of relationship between a citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that there will never be a Russian, German or Mongolian invasion.
I find it amusing that you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if necessary.
Don't play with fire.
It only takes one election in the USA to ruin their budget and the whole NATO goes down the drain.
The English will exchange us for Russian rubbish, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they will take whatever they want.
The only thing that works as a long-term guarantor of independence is an armed army with teeth and a population able to master the military technology of their time.
Today, every teenager knows how to remotely control the means of transport.
We don't need border fortifications, they are out of date today, but a teenager with a remote-controlled weapon will be able to deal with it.
How to survive a crab wave
Do you want to give gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find yourself at home surrounded by boxes and packaging?
This "dump" is being used again by e-shops who are missing packaging materials.
This led to the creation of a map of trade-ins, which shows where your used bins are ending up.
Not just at Christmas.
All enclosure materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is a mistake to treat them as a one-off.
Kdokoliv může po dohodě přinést do zapojeného obchodu (mapa projektu KAMsNIM.cz jich obsahuje bezmála 150) kartonové krabice, plastové nebo papírové výplně.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste produced and avoid overcrowded blue containers.
Individual shops are focusing on packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market and also saved money, as cardboard packaging has dropped by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of eco-conscious customers, this strengthens my brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of ecological cosmetics and toiletries.
Krabice and packaging material are transported to Popůvek near Brno by individuals who have accumulated at home, but we also hear from companies, with whom we have agreed regular collections of cartons that have been postponed.
We use everything when packing parcels from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies we are building a more considerate world together.
Our aim is to preserve the sources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application not only shows collection points for packaging material.
If you need to get rid of anything (household rubbish, out-of-date medication, used tyres, old electrical appliances, batteries, light bulbs, large quantities of rubbish, etc.), this is the place to come.
All rubbish will end up in the right place, and items that can be reused will find a second home.
The map of the project contains more than 100,000 such locations.
More and more collection points, re-use centres, container parks for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other locations are being added to it, helping to find new uses for things that would otherwise be waste, says Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the group Ukliďme Česko.
I find it sad that in today's world, technology is so simple and user-friendly that children who use computers or phones play games, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that students at universities do not understand the principle of components on computers.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo apps, or even mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with its components and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from a young age, but mainly teach them something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of French presidency of the EU - starting in January - and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo for his presidency, called for Europeans to be protected - at work, on the streets - and listed so many initiatives that it was hard to keep count.
However, French politicians are happy about this and so are their voters.
Macron's supporters who want to break the right-left divide agree on little but Europe.
France will have new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately sprang to Macron's defence, saying that he was promoting pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to rewrite history to defend themselves.
The far-right candidate for French president, Eric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War Two, was not so bad and is very popular with the French.
Let's take Macron's proposal for a history textbook seriously and not just brush off what's going on in France.
Nebyla by zapotřebí?
In European countries, students are taught history as a story of us versus them, never as a story of the whole.

The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The film, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and best actress for Jasna Duričić.

Buses will start running according to the new timetable, with some changes in the drivers
From Sunday trains will be running according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet will start to run instead of Czech Railways.
In most cases, only the time of departure is adjusted, and the route is only slightly changed.
There will also be dozens of new trains.
Since the start of the autumn, bus companies have been starting their journeys.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger trains per day in the new timetable, of which an average of 4,780 long-distance trains.
Vlaky will travel around 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
Trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland as part of the new timetable.
The company, along with the new timetable, will introduce dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be operated by the transport company in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
Transport companies also traditionally raise ticket prices by an average of 3.2 percent next year.
Trains take inflation into account when setting their fares annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entrance to line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
Due to the success in the ministry of transport competition, the company will replace Czech Railways.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at stations in Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express will keep its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlárik, the transport company tried to maintain as close to the original journey times as possible, even during planned engineering works.
Trains operated by Arriva and other operators are expected to continue as normal.
Trains are also changing in some regional lines.
Passengers, for example, can expect changes in Liberec, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Liberec to Rumburk will be operated by the German company, Trilex, instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use unified rail fares for the second year running.
Like Czech Railways, their price will increase by the inflation rate of 3.2 percent.
I must dissent.
Are we not going to look at the other side's perspective?
We hear about how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to hide, how they died.
In life I have never heard a lecture from the point of view of the slave owners or at that time, no one defends it, everyone condemns it.
Nobody in school ever told me that black people often sold other black people into slavery, and that they were often the worst slave owners.
Nobody at school teaches you that colonizers often bought the land from the Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we, Europeans, exterminated them, meanwhile they were exterminating each other for a long time among themselves.
I also spent some time in the USA, in both northern and southern schools.
I was surprised that someone would deliberately omit facts, but I've heard of this happening before and to me it's a problem, it's not something I deny (in Japan, for example, the atrocities of WW2 are still taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective without understanding.
History doesn't need our feelings, it just is what it is and I think it's a fatal error to judge without looking at the context of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do it again.
Mimochodem když už jsme u těch jižanských států, ano, konfederační vlajka a slavní otrokáři tam jsou docela populární, na druhou stranu i oni měli nějaké své dobré úspěchy a přišlo mi absurdní je zavrhovat.
In addition, the North was not much better, how many people idealize it today.
People also forget that not all Southerners were slave owners and a lot of things went against them too.
This is something that I would never say about Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, and in addition, our point of view does not exist for them (on YT there was even a video from TV where someone started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me at US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country had never experienced.
Overall, I came to the conclusion that at some universities it was a shock, those students were too radicalized and those schools were supporting them to that extent.
When I think about the fact that these people will be much older one day, it makes me a little sad that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among young people and also among the ruling elite.
I think that feminism has already achieved what it set out to do and has moved on to something else, it has become radicalized.
Nowadays, those who call themselves feminists are those who have nothing in common with it and ignore basic biological facts, and this leads to radicalisation on the other side too, where it often leads to opposition even to quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, at the end of the day, I have not encountered anyone who would blame me for colonialism or slavery.
I met with bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I wouldn't like it, but because it would be completely pointless.
Am I proud of something that I couldn't do myself?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary from the perspective of some personal identity.
If it's something to do with people and their interests, views on the world and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, you can tell them this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
Ten Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always manages to slip in some nonsense about the coronavirus, telling everyone to wash their hands.
Of course the Czechoslovak Hussite Church is here.
They are officially Protestants, but in reality, they were born from Catholic modernism and are actually Catholic without a Pope.
I know a lot of Catholics who go to Protestant services because they are theologically similar but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on the street Botanická.
St. Michael's Church on the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there, every Sunday at 3 p.m., they celebrate mass in Latin, as was the case before Vatican II.
Bethlehem nativity scene in Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - Plamínek, which was blessed in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouting for him because of the pandemic of coronavirus did not go to Vienna this time, but in the morning they took him from his Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
At the border, they were taken over by lorries.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the group every year, we look forward to it a lot.
It is an honour for me that I was chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While the previous handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, the handover now takes place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing car park.
Scouts usually travel to Vienna by train for him.
The spread of the blight across the Czech Republic remains unchanged.
S the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally travel to Brno by train, where they pass it on to the Bishop of the Diocese, Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent relay of light will take place on Saturday 18th December, and will be carried out by scout guides, who will travel on selected express trains and local trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the lighting in the stations, and they will then spread the flames across the Czech Republic and wherever railways do not reach.
I letos musí skauti dodržovat platné opatření proti šíření koronaviru.
It's done the same way.
We are advising courier teams and organizers of local events to wear masks, to keep a distance from each other, to minimize the number of people, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in such a way as to be as safe as possible, said the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and quiet at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope, light that overcomes darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and guides have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action is carried out by hundreds of volunteers, and the torch is also a symbol of impartiality and human solidarity.
All the latest news, including the list of places where people can light a candle, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the basics of economics that would confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (such as water retention), healthcare and education properly utilize these funds, but I don't understand why these funds are given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces surplus product and floods the free market and "kills the company".
I work in a factory where there are a million signs on the corridors "XY financed/co-financed by project XY" and such a company is simply kept alive artificially.
This is not support for the company that gives jobs to x people, this is stagnation of development when this company holds and takes contracts/employees from other companies, which could grow and be more productive after its collapse.
A near-unanimous agreement, that is.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age will fall for some trick or scam - especially advertising.
I think that internet advertising doesn't affect me, but then again, I'm sure it does - it's just so ingrained that people never resist it.

2. "I won't believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television is leading the trend for Christmas films, with two hundred premieres last year
Los Angeles - TV channels and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen in line with the festive film trend, premiering more than 200 Christmas movies to their viewers this year.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with audiences in recent years, and has significantly increased viewing figures, so more and more of these films are being made.
Four times as many Christmas films have been released this year as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database will, however, include only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more Christmas films.
Christmas movies have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated with fairy tales, and worldwide, with films such as Home Alone, Love in the Sky, or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
The real Christmas movie boom actually started in 2009, when US cable channel Hallmark introduced a special film series, the BBC server remembers.
Her advent calendar, called Countdown to Christmas, featured four films and was a huge hit.
The station began airing its holiday specials on October 22 and will run a total of 42 Christmas movies.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming services such as Netflix are also contributing to the overall total.
In this magical time of year, it doesn't really matter what the story is about, as long as there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing, said Brandon Gray, author of the book "I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies," with tongue in cheek.
For the viewer, it's a form of escape and a way to get at least two hours of calm in the midst of all the holiday insanity and the insanity of the world we live in the last few years, Gray added.
According to him, for example, the television channel Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is both uniform and successful.
You have two people who are attracted to each other, but then there's some kind of misunderstanding that arises about half an hour before the end, which is resolved amicably and they kiss.
It's always the same thing, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after the other, adds Gray.

Haas sends only one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he was attacking for a better position from 20th on the grid.
Rus Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not be taking part in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
He had tested positive for Covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the starting grid, with Mick Schumacher, a team mate of Mazepin's, starting from last place, and Max Verstappen, who will be battling Lewis Hamilton for the title, starting from first.
Mazepin is doing well according to Haas, and there are no signs of any issues.
Nikita was physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
Now it is in quarantine and will be under the control of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the overriding priority for all parties involved," its representatives said for formula1.com.
Haas cannot send a replacement driver to the race, either.
Any replacement riders would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
COVID-19 has not yet affected the first competitor.
At the start of the just-finished season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, with Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton being the only ones to have been tested positively.
So they can close them too.

From a legal perspective, Covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
It is in the same group as HIV, measles, mumps and typhoid.

Is Mutace Omikron spreading to the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
We are currently investigating another case of this variant in another child from Adam's class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proven, said Ciupek.
Six cases were reported in the region during the week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - this is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague, the director said.
She added that they are two nurses from one department of the Faculty Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old students from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, and four have an unpredictable course.
No one travelled abroad with suspicion of Omikron
None of the individuals listed above traveled abroad, nor did any of their family members, and there has been no contact with anyone who has traveled abroad.
None of the people mentioned have any connection with the water polo championship, said Ciupek.

California limits gun sales.
Wants to move forward like Texas with a ban on abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism similar to the one Texas used in its controversial abortion law after detecting a heartbeat in an embryo.
People who make or sell assault weapons in California would be liable for damages if anyone uses one in a lawsuit.
The Newsom announcement comes in response to a Thursday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld a Texas law banning abortion, overturning a nearly 50-year-old precedent that had established a nationwide right to abortion about 24 weeks into pregnancy.
However, the Supreme Court is currently not deciding on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on a technical issue which arises from the innovative design of the measures.
Enforcing the ban was left to the public in this case, allowing Texan Republicans to block it through the usual legal channels.
I am outraged by the recent (Friday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the Texas law that bans most abortion providers and undercuts the constitutional right to abortion, the California governor said.
If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, California will use this power to protect human life, Newsom continued.
He entrusted his subordinates with the task of working together with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice to introduce measures that would enable representatives of the public to demand a ban on assault rifles and so-called spiritual weapons.
These are homemade firearms that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in damages from anyone in California who makes, sells, or transfers assault weapons, parts to make "ghost guns" or complete sets for their manufacture.
If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is through the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do, the California governor said.
The AP reports that the California ban on the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons has been in place for a decade, but a federal judge there blocked the ban in June as unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court, however, did not grant full immunity to the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to proceed with lawsuits against select officials in the Southern state.
Each emergency vaccination campaign has a public testing phase, during which the way the vaccination scheme will look is gradually worked out, and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, Israel has already conducted large-scale studies on the effects of 4 doses.
According to these studies, the majority of patients will experience a fivefold increase in antibodies, which will have a long-term effect on you.
Just like any other vaccine, it will eventually have a schedule, it's just too soon right now.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to come onto the market in the near future, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises 10 times greater effectiveness.

Poland Threatens to Halt Payments to EU Budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission was acting in violation of the law if it were to use the new powers and suspend payments to Poland over the legal state dispute.
The committee has postponed approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the EU fund to revive economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would not have a comfortable majority in the Sejm.
Poland would also have to weigh up its obligations in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to a dramatic increase in energy prices, Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I would demand that Poland suspends its contributions to the EU.
It was unacceptable that the EU unlawfully withheld funds from the joint budget to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
Its stance on EU membership is more radical than the governing party, Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, changes that have taken place in the Polish justice system since Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions because its aim is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate of extortion and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on partnership of sovereign states, and not on government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree that Poland should be a colony, he said.
Admitting that... At Lidl we have one type of cheese in four different locations.
I was looking for other things, I met a yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk dispensers I gave up and asked.
They had him, that's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and lactose-free zone...
If there's a ban, it won't be available in any market, it won't be available in any pharmacy, the gold shop on the square, they don't have such a selection, but usually they have everything I need and it's in some kind of order, so I can do it in ten minutes.

Sorry for the interruption and have a nice day to all of you.
In my childhood I was whipped with a belt.
It was never because of marks, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to sleep, washed dishes, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without being warned, my mother always started by threatening that if I did it again, she would give me a beating (sometimes even after another "nagging" she just brought and put down so that I could see it).
Only then did I get a few kicks in the backside (through my clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishment (in a reasonable way and measure) is helpful because the child reacts much more to it than to words.
What is important to me is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a way of choosing whether or not to listen and get better and avoid punishment.
In the end, most of the time, I just needed to warn her to start listening.
Defending the system
When the renowned Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, was asked by a journalist in 1999 what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swears an oath and which is taught at school from an early age, or a contract that can be changed if necessary - he definitely preferred the first interpretation.
Once we agreed on democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which at the same time define who is the state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
Imagine: some nations have their own rules, and even like them.
Just like the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl asked at the time.
However, in recent times, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
Leta is being tested by situations that its creators (to whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged among them) could not predict, such as the behaviour of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
All we know about such documents is that political interference in their text must be considered.
It is necessary to understand and actively defend the institution, only then can it be the key to solving most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a certain order of governance consisting of individual rules, which set out the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to use their power.
Covid-19 doesn't discriminate, in Brno, FN fighters are fighting for their lives for several months
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases, with which hospitals are struggling mainly in recent times.
We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, speaking of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, said the head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University, Petr Dominik, to Novinky.
The course is usually easier, lighter, and often occurs without symptoms.
There are children who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we can see in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, it is dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at a clinic for childhood infectious diseases.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been taken to the ARU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
We are now seeing an increase in children presenting with severe acute Covid-19 pneumonia, which is characterised by respiratory distress requiring admission to the intensive care unit, he said, adding that the illness was also affecting teenagers as well as infants and toddlers.
Hospitals are seeing children in critical condition with the virus.
At the moment we have children of several months and adolescents, said the chief physician.
However, they are happy that there have been no child fatalities in the children's hospital in Brno, FN Brno, so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6th December.
According to Dominik, the children's hospital – not just on the coronavirus ward – is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
It also warns that, just as with adults, vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease in children and reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
We recommend the HPV vaccine for children as well, the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on designated paths.
And the quiet zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on map.cz.
Generally speaking, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk wherever you like (but not over the fence into the forest).
Cycling/riding a bike in the forest outside marked trails is not allowed anywhere, unless you have a permit (of course, this applies to national parks as well).

China Builds Impression of Handling Virus and Authoritarian Regime Facing Crisis Better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression that it has mastered the epidemic and that the authoritarian regime is better able to cope with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
Prior to a few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to contain an outbreak that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero growth in new cases.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective masks and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How to measure Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?

World events are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become a major power if it works on its integration.
So far it has functioned at the level of the economy and politics (in selected questions), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It will not be for 10, 15 or 20 years.
Maybe in the middle of the century they will be different and it will happen.

I'm not a Czech language expert, so I'll probably butcher it.
In general, the ellipse includes two different units at the same level.
I will use an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear whether the mandarins are from Spain.
Furthermore, I am relying on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces," including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it to be included in that broad definition and not need to be further specified for US forces.
Again, just for fun:
Whether that is true or not, it is an unreasonable request

Briton Vicki Holland tortured pet chimpanzee Milly
Disturbing footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet as its callous owner laughed at it
Holland also fed her parakeets, kebabs and hamburgers regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Specialists in monkey rehabilitation who care for Milly after her ordeal say they have never seen such a traumatised monkey before.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
A mother-of-four has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was fined £120 by Gwent Magistrates' Court and given a 12-month driving ban, suspended for a year.
Hollandova was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, a lifetime ban on owning animals and must pay £12,000 in costs.
Head of the Small Monkeys team that rescued the abused animals, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine but the rehabilitation process will continue."
It took Milly some time to get used to people again.
She shrank and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, she can still trigger panic in her by looking at new people.
Psychological scars of abuse will stay with her forever, Sawyer said.
Milly's ordeal came to light after police in Gwent discovered disturbing footage on the woman's phone during a raid on her property over a drugs investigation.
In the background you can hear Milly swearing.
In a subsequent video, Holland is heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying: "You want some coke?"
Don't touch me with your dirty fingers.
In May, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), she pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden inside Kinder Eggs at her home
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a conditional sentence of 20 months.
What wondrous concepts will you learn from this bygone era, thrice over, as you boldly leapfrog the entire 20th century?
Are you going to take the same things as in the first grade?

The main thing is to write a test for 1 and then nobody cares.
Run and ask people on the street whether they can solve the character roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and the vast majority of people just brush it off and tell you it's no big deal.
What the hell is this guy teaching?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
At this point it is unnecessary and you will never get it back.
It's partly for all those people who need this or that.
As for that, here's a note that you don't need all of that at the stand by the machine, I thought about it very seriously... because you simply don't need it.
In addition, we are gradually moving towards the time when we will not know what punk is.
(On which our communist past and our anti-intellectualism and anti-elitism probably play a role) However, the price we pay for having those machines staffed by barbarians is simply too high.

This is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right now," Andrea replied on Instagram Stories to curious fans' questions about what had disappointed her so much about Kadir that she decided to end all contact with him and even block him on social media.
Ever since the start of the experiment, Kadri and Andreou have been at loggerheads.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there with him, at least until he returns to the Czech Republic permanently.
She flatly refused.
As you see, their relationship not only ended in love, but also grew into mutual contempt and even hatred.
There was a planned attack on you! he retorted to Kadri in response to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Kadri's supposed honesty did not sit well with his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
He decided to publicly denounce his brother.
Normally I wouldn't say anything about such things, and in my family we never really talked about such things.
Nechci vyvolat lítost.
Whenever I see someone publicly disrespecting and dragging someone's name through the mud that I really like, I just can't take it!
I'm sorry it has to be done this way but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadir for being the character he is and helping our family when we needed it most at such a young age.
I get more angry when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our close friends and family, in response to the words of Andrey.
I am really grateful for everything!
Of course people will believe what they read, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love and know the reality and know what really happened, she said vaguely.
The drunk burglar climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
Believe me, for what.
Chao began his burglary spree in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, trying to get into several cars.
According to the available information, the fare was finally calculated at approximately 330 korunas from one vehicle.
Afterwards, he did not do anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and jump through an open window into the flat.
He stole two bananas.
Security camera footage then shows him walking away from the scene of the crime, eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not there, where they were, and he called the police.
Then Cchaa stopped.
The man admitted to having consumed some alcohol on the day in question.
Because he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is currently under investigation.
Opilec climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is linked to the level of pandemic preparedness.
When that is abolished, the law will be ineffective.
Law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assembly will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for local elections in four towns on Saturday
People voted for the new council on Saturday in the towns of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number stipulated by law or the elected council has broken up.
Of the 28 seats up for grabs, 99 candidates were vying for them on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes a fairly demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there, said Eva Krumpová, chairperson of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that because of the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komňa on the outskirts of Uherský Brod, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, gaining 27.76 percent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Občané pro Komňu also won two seats on the council, gaining 18.52 percent of the vote.
The current mayor of the town, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Christian Democrats, has also been elected to the Town Council.
Komňany - independent candidates - gained one seat in the municipal council.
Turnout was 75.48 percent of eligible voters.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov, the Pro Rovná association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which translates to four out of seven seats.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have also been elected to the municipal council.
Turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeat elections in Lužice in Most were won again by the Lužice and Svinčice Association, led by mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, like in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second-placed candidate, Obec pro lid, which received 43.27 percent of the vote, will have three representatives in the council.
Turnout was 76.7 percent of eligible voters.
Independent candidate Naděje pro Novou Ves won the elections in Nová Ves on Liberecku ahead of Hnutí ANO.
For the Association of Independent Candidates, 59.88 percent of the voters voted and gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
The ANO party received 40.12 percent of the vote and increased its representation in the regular elections in 2018, gaining more seats and having three.
Turnout was 42.9 percent of registered voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will announce the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
Do you think that would have been a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think that all these things that people are writing to you here are well known.
Jen si hraješ na hlupáka aby ses měl s kým "hádat".
If not, it's sad.
I don't think Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
Once upon a time I liked a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, to look good).
As for me, I have only one, who in what I believe.
On the other hand, I find it disturbing how much the Church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, suppressing science and so on.
Nemluvě o všech válkách, které způsobila, např. ta třicetiletá
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to say to each other
The man fell head first from a height of twelve metres.
The impact on the concrete survived.
Incredibly, a man survived a fall on Sunday night in Ostrava, where rescue services were called.
Workers at the regional operational centre received an emergency call at 1am on Sunday with initial details of a man falling from a height.
Two ZZS crews - medical and paramedical - rushed to the scene immediately.
Upon arriving at the scene, doctors found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a height of around twelve metres and hit his head on the concrete!
Coals were caught in Vítkovice.
It was not as it should have been, and the firefighters went into action.
When the emergency services arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple lacerations and in imminent danger of his life.
The emergency doctor intubated his airways, ensured artificial ventilation and, following further interventions as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava Trauma Centre, said spokesperson for the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more afraid of the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities than of the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of defence against the infection is primarily the doctors and healthcare staff.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA had a red carpet event full of interesting results.
Things came to a head at UFC 269.
Outsiderka Julianna Peňová managed to beat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found an opponent for seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division did not hesitate, he showed great wrestling against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory, knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also beat his opponent, Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one was expecting.
He brings the women's bantamweight fight between Ronda Rousey and Miesha Tate.
The American entered the mutual combat as a hypothetical "giant", as Nunes had not lost a match for seven years and was looking for another triumph.
The start of the duel was also carried out in the spirit of the paper assumptions.
Nunes started her path to victory with a lot of activity and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Penova did not give up and tried to attack with a stun gun.
The second round was intense and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both fighters came out swinging with a flurry of punches and hard rights.
Penna also got the upper hand on Nunes, taking her down to the ground.
Ta musela snahu vzdát a atak odklepat.
The American caused a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The main event of the evening was the battle for the lightweight title between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Things were going well for Poirier at first, but the cards eventually turned against him.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to grab his opponent's arm.
To se mu příliš nepovedlo, poté ale vytvořil velký tlak, dostal soupeře na záda a zasypal ho řadou ran.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira applied a rear naked choke, which Poirier initially resisted, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley dominated with a masterful performance, landing a hard right hand to the jaw of Raulian Paivu in the first round.
He followed that with a flurry of precise punches and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara France was able to beat Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another victory with her little girl, now seven years old.
Ten kyčel, nebo ta kyčel?
At first glance, there is nothing complicated about it.
Most basic nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and there is no problem in determining whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
However, there is also a fairly large group of substantial nouns, the gender of which is not fixed.
Significant names can be either male or female.
When inflected, they have double consonants and in some cases remain in an uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are of masculine and feminine gender, the former is declined according to the pattern "stroj" and the latter according to the pattern "píseň".
Other groups of substantial nouns differ in their forms in the first person singular, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
These words are spelled the same, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some words can differ regionally, for example, "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case, the Moravian variant is not written, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "príkop" and "príkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" and so on.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally uninflected, but have gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is of masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which remains in the middle gender and has endings according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey opened the way to Europe for migrants.
What is the situation directly on the Greek borders?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get to Europe.
Thousands of people have started to move to the southern periphery of the Schengen space after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians promise Greece support, Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
Who is actually motivating refugees to take the uncertain path?
How does the situation look directly on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months and we've been choking, the Sydney-based journalist said.
Devastating bushfires, which have plagued Australia for the past four months, have killed almost thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Does the government of Prime Minister Morrison need to do more to head off the dire consequences, as critics claim?
What will the world need to do to prepare for climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to Sydney journalist Ika Detrichova.
False accusations are always and have always been rare.
Proto always writes everywhere.
For people, it's uncomfortable dealing with how sexual assault looks in our society and how pervasive it is, so they try to sweep it under the rug.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have experienced how their surroundings or even the police behave towards them.
The victims should always be believed.
It has become clear that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Nevertheless, a lot of people leave it to themselves.
Some will find those who falsely accuse others.
You are contributing to the normalization of sexual violence by spreading the idea that "a lot of accusations are false" and that it's a "trend" helping sexual predators.
Czech floods swamp new homes, leaving families out of pocket
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in the past few weeks and months.
A number of people have been put in difficult positions as a result.
It does not have the means to complete the houses that are already under construction and the bank is refusing to increase the mortgage loans.
Besides the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People do not have enough money to complete the family homes that are already under construction.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
In the best-case scenario, people are moving into unfinished and untested homes.
In the worst case, the houses that are being built are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they can't afford to pay the mortgages and the rent," says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
Over the course of a year, we will build two to three family homes, and in 50 per cent of cases that is what will happen.
For us, as a construction company, it is difficult in that we must adhere to certain things contractually, even if the material is expensive.
So we are doing it for free," said the owner of the construction firm, Zdenek Slivon.
Spousta people will only have financial problems.
If they were counting on the house costing five million, now it will cost seven.
I think that some people will wait," added Slivon.
The most material was lead, iron and also installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling to find enough workers.
In the Czech Republic there is a shortage of graduates in construction professions and the influx of foreign workers is slowing down the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuing of building permits is currently more favourable.
Building authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than last year, Křeček specified.
We are doing well and will do even better.
The actual vision is missing, says the commentator on Czech Radio - MujRozhlas.
Entrance into the new year has traditionally been accompanied by statements from politicians.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the leader of ANO, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message from the President, Miloš Zeman, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn from the basic course?
As for me, I'm getting my master's degree in law, I have my own topic which I chose myself, it's connected to my bachelor's degree, I always work on it throughout the year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
Diplomatic immunity is absolute in our country, if a man is not a total idiot and something is left in his head, the commission will not bother him with the theory.
I spent a week studying for the state exam, and when I was at the end of my tether, the commission always tried to introduce me to some logical deduction, which I immediately understood, and I got it right.
For those projects, known people, who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did that a lot, really useful, learn a lot), and then just learn the project and are prepared.
According to me, it is great when at the end of the subject there is an exam, which tests the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defence.
Don't send any emails or phones to the embassy.
Budeš stejnej čůrák jak oni.
The people at the embassy have nothing in common.
If they were against Russia, they would have a lot of risk, so they may have to play with them because otherwise something might happen to them.
You can calmly erect a statue of Putin next to the statue of the squirrel Pú.

I agree, even though Insta is kicking artists while they're down.
If you post stories every day and at least every second day a new picture, your reach will decrease to almost nothing.
In addition, it changes what is more important for the function, whether it is the like, comment or storage.
I've been struggling with this a lot lately, so maybe I'll have to tone it down, because there are a lot of artists in my field who are doing really well and aren't giving up on it.
In the end, it may have been possible that I was even happy, if something user-friendly came along that did not stifle the creativity and energy of artists
Statement by the Party of Workers of Donbass
Federation – yes, dissolution – no, they express their opinion against the dissolution of the USSR on the photo.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 4th, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history occurred.
On December 8th, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum on March 17th, 1991, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as an international legal subject and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
One stroke of the pen "abolished" a huge country with almost three million inhabitants.
With the dissolution of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves living abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the Russian population in the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Even before the same people, who destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years in Bělověžský prales in one sitting, betrayed the socialist cause (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War),
Intentionally carried out deindustrialization, hindered agriculture, detached fourteen republics from the world's largest power, which had previously been economically united in one mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the depopulation of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, wars in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the Orange Revolutions, NATO expansion to the East, war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily abandoned and surrendered quickly filled and occupied the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken mainly by events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of goods sold in supermarkets with high turnover does not necessarily correspond to their quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč/kg.
I will buy it with the understanding that I will put it in the freezer and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality where I don't buy meat on Mondays, on Tuesdays the butcher chain reduces the price of meat by 99 Kč/kg - explain to me the mechanism by which this meat becomes a threat to my digestive system?
Or I wait until Wednesday and the meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption discounted to 69 Kč / kg - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 Kč and left in my freezer for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
These things are saying that if something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed to be bad, dirty or of low quality, they are very backward, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, in Brno, I went to Hlavas and in the basement, a lady was handing out some kind of flyer, similar to things I always take, to help the brigadiers, to get rid of things they can't...
No, the leaflet was full of peasant common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I guessed it was some sort of propaganda.
After reading I found out who was publishing it and in the end scientology came out of it.
No, as it was a good matroš, full of completely unnecessary lessons, as if I have to earn my living.
The forests would not have to be cut down because of the paper shortage.
Something similar I experienced with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail are used to get you to do something for that person because you like them, even if you are aware of how much power they have over the situation.
Several times she threatened to commit suicide because I went out with a guy she didn't like.
Even when I wanted to leave her apartment, she would cry and beg me not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the doors.
It was a super relationship for about a year and a half, but then it went down the pan for another half a year.
Then I ended that relationship by telling her that we were breaking up, but I also told her that I could still talk to her next week to calm her down and prevent her from doing something crazy.
Such a person sucks the energy, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Rather hold back
When insurance companies here are frantically slashing prices for HIV tests and hunting for positives who would otherwise be unaware of their status.
The only thing we can do is complicate things for companies, carriers and others because their employees received five days of home detention for the generator of random numbers.
In the West, they've given up on the measles vaccine and recognised that it's not worth trying to solve a disease weaker than the famous whooping cough.
Sadly, Válek is new and has to earn his stripes and work on his ego.
We thought that the old good smith was coming back to us.
After several years of decline and suppression of this dirty business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a first-year student at university), the initial promises of training products and commercial skills soon turned into "it doesn't matter, just get people in".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring the crap out of people and upselling.
When the first earnings came in, people quickly realised that if they wanted to make money, they had to flog a few sure things monthly.
Investment-linked life assurance and mortgages were the only earners, so people felt like door-to-door salesmen selling washing machines.
What I can say is that the experience was valuable, people learned that they don't have to jump on every bandwagon and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put them all in one basket.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not celebrate with expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced such things.
HR is sleeping, managers are looking for their management and they don't give a damn about us.
Regular evaluation is thus done in some way, in the form of setting some goals for the next year, looking back at what went well and what did not during the year - this is more self-evaluation than having someone evaluate you based on some numbers, and so on.
Workplace activities are also voluntary.
However, we are somewhat unique within our company - they are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person has the feeling that we are such a startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation no.
Ale it doesn't affect us much as long as the results are good.
Missing Czech woman found dead in UK
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching for the 32-year-old Czech woman for almost ten days after she went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday 12th December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
British police this afternoon regrettably confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of the Czech citizen who had been missing.
The cause of death is being investigated.
We will not disclose any more information about the family.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek wrote on Twitter.
The last time anyone saw the young woman was on a bus on the afternoon of November 28 as she was heading home from work, having withdrawn money from an ATM before getting on the bus.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues five days later.
Following this, the Metropolitan Police launched a manhunt, with Interpol adding her to its list of missing persons worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested one man in connection with the incident a few days ago.
He played a role in the case, but what that role was, she did not reveal.
In four municipalities new mayors were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday 11th December, new town councils were elected in the towns of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number stipulated by law or the elected council has broken up.
99 valid candidates ran for the 28 seats in the new elections.
Turnout was 62.41 percent.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballot.
The mandate was won by 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the municipal councils in the specified four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men ran for the 28 seats.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, and the oldest was 72 years old.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes a fairly demanding but successful year.
They took place there four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we usually work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which place greater demands on equipment and personal security, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Deputy Director of the Czech Statistical Office.
The final electoral district was processed at 03:49 on Sunday 12th December.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will announce the results of the voting, which will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
That is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
We have managed to deal with the fact that we have a dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but without any major problems.
Deal with the fact that a large portion of the population, on all levels, are acting like idiots about it, and that's my problem now.
I look forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) the most because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people aren't talking.
He was removed from office and disqualified from holding it again.
However, there is a chance that it will actually happen, and others mention it a lot.
In addition, I am not sure whether it would be possible to consider the mapping of the register as treason at all.
Impeachment is such an act that the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate lives: The number of people under 35 going a year without sex is on the rise
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
It is mainly religious people, says the website of the Daily Mail.
Research has shown that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people aged under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight to 21 per cent.
More than ever before, women aged 18 to 35 who said they did not have sex in the past year.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher unemployment rate.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute to making sex less of a priority for young people.
The proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they did not have sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly since 2010, according to IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married individuals, sexual activity is more frequent, and only 5% of them reported being abstinent in the past year.
Among the free people, that was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage before the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs also contribute to a decrease in sexual activity.
While there is a higher likelihood that married couples will be sexually active, the percentage of married and engaged couples under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people's opinions on premarital sex are divided, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while around 70% think it's okay.
It's true that they are a minority among free individuals in this age group, but their behaviour is pushing this trend, says Stone about these 30 percent.
For the majority of those with moral objections to premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among 35-year-olds who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to almost 60 percent.
The trend among the "nones" is going up from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed to by other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another factor may be the proliferation of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online fulfilling this need.
This trend really took off during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole issue of vaccination against COVID-19 is about whether society should force part of the population to behave in a way they don't want to, but which could save their lives.
It is quite a difficult question, but the one that personally interests me the most is the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it will be our fault if we tell them not to do it and they die.
My argument is that we certainly could have killed the 80-year-old man who really didn't know much, we did a good job of not explaining it to him, he heard some disinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and ended up dying.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of an opponent of vaccinations, who was on the side of the SPD and the KSČ, who was shouting about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned earlier, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to afford it.
No snow in the Czech Republic.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against dryness?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Providers of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, and even the preparation of the cross-country Jizera 50 can be complicated by the weather.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What does a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd like to tell you a story, but it's not about a babysitter.
Once, in middle school, our teacher took us on a tour of the shipyard so that we could go on a boat trip down the river.
That is how we walked down one such very wide street, and who in the middle we cannot see - supporters of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they got us.
Fortunately, I managed to escape, but I got into an argument with one of my friends.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what they were saying.
Bite me, if you want to save your soul.
I have already told them that I have no soul, she replied.
We all went down to the shipyard, including the teacher.
We're a mess.
It's not that much, but the system is collapsing, says Orozovic
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday following previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honours.
We are opening a new chapter in relations, Morawiecki said at a joint press conference following the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violations of Ukrainian territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border can be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the prime minister had been informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially provoked a migrant crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons because every night we are recording hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
The Prime Minister was talking to the Chancellor about further sanctions to make Lukashenka's regime and its backers in the Kremlin understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime towards ordinary people.
Polish nun caused crash, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but was driven by a different nun, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that even so she could lose her driving licence for giving priority in driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, said TVN24.
She admitted that another nun had collided with her car while asking for help.
Then the police came for Celestina's sister.
They gave her a breath test, and when they found out her blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she will have to answer for her actions in court.
Peace Hugo is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič did not attend the screening of his film.
Czech creators of family comedies take inspiration from American dog movies.
However, they forgot the most important thing: the laws of the film craft.
After the hugely successful film F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live - another film, Tady hlídame my (Here We Stand Guard), is now being made about audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director, Juraj Šajmovič ml., freely continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Back on stage, the talking parrot, Hugo, and some well-known characters appear around him.
Julie has Ivan, the owner of a Bohemian guest house, who is dying, and so people start to call in the exorcists, Julie's father and partner, and above all her daughter Veronika.
She's not a little girl anymore, but a teenager experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Saumovich (who is also the producer of the film), struggled with the pacing of the story in their previous film, but at least the children and the dog were cute.
This time, the creative duo have come up with an even weaker script, which elicits a mixture of awe and disbelief.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, a scientist, succumbs to the charms of motherhood in her quest for a child, and when the stars align, she gets down to business with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates happen to be - on the bonnet of a car or the bell tower of a church (of course, during a guided tour with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír, despite his extensive training in shooting in the woods, shoots his own daughter (Julie), who falls into a coma, and is taken away by the family to be treated in a hospital, so that the miraculous process of healing can take place in the heart of the Bohemian forest.
Nic against cleaning nature and the strength of animal idols.
Their owners know why.
The viewer may be surprised at how much content full of unbelievable situations and figures was required for this message.
A pair of villains from the staff, a competition for pejskaři, a charlatan from the Šumava, police officers arriving to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilising power of bone marrow, and of course, the family in the pension, who are of course drinking moonshine.
When the heroine, after a long coma, wakes up and sits at the dinner table with her family smoking a cigarette and demanding whiskey and fried chicken as a recovered vegetarian, it's hard not to laugh.
The creators will also explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with texts, the ability to construct the main situations, the ability to create characters and plot points, and the ability to direct.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clumsy and the overall impression is of a film that has lost its way.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to save their parties, they have little to play with.
The only thing that remains of the film are the poetic shots of the Bohemian forest by the camera man, Vladimir Holomka, and the two deer.
It's not enough to draw a few characters, a flimsy plot and barking sound effects, it's also necessary to use more down-to-earth vulgar expressions, which the characters use.
Neither is being a long-standing member of the Rabbit Breeders Club - as is the case with the lady producer.
To promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, one must also have knowledge of the craft, if the man wants to tell a believable story.
It did not succeed in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of irony for the genre in this family photo.
This amateur footage of cannibalism would not have passed muster as advertisement for cannibalism.
Yeah, respect, because they have to listen to continuous beeps, just like you.
The difference between offering and coercing, here you can see how it is understood, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you were to listen to such kids, you might change your mind.
This job is like any other, in this case a brigade on the construction site.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
In the meantime, it is the only time of year that it rains.
Almost no rainfall during the month of November is unusual, according to the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel claims only six percent of the long-term average rainfall in November.
This week's two-day deluge was more of an exception.
This is good for us.
Long time no see.
This is the right Christmas atmosphere, said the resident of Nazareth, Wasím Aškar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, and is erratic and unpredictable.
Winter rain is good for dependent forests.
Without them, they are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about water supplies and farmland for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was almost full this spring thanks to three consecutive wet winters.
Levels have been falling since then.
Water managers have been warning of drought for some time now.
It's expected that with global warming and changes in climate, there will be less rainfall here, said Israeli Water Authority spokesman Uri Schor in 2018.
Israel uses technology such as desalination or wastewater recycling to help.
Poor countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan are economically weak.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, tanker trucks are becoming more and more common.
Waterways and private wells, however, are being drained.
This year I have received orders for 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years, said Imád Sulejman, a driver of a tanker truck.
In the Iranian city of Isfahan, there were clashes between farmers and security forces.
Drought was the cause of the protests.
The local river has run dry.
The region has the driest November in many years behind it.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
Israeli Defense Minister said that the talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had instructed the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is based in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to ramp up pressure on Iran but also inform Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna have not brought "any progress" and the world powers "know that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago this happened to me.
I flirted with her a little bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicion about the pyramid was justified.
Since I really don't like these pranks, I asked her a few more questions and then thanked her and left.
Calmly tell me I'm deluded, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Snowboarders and skiers hit the slopes over the weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first big surge in interest in skiing over the weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need to panic about the snow, and some ski resorts have started to operate.
Attendees were not exempt from the requirement to produce a COVID-19 certificate at the entrance.
While some ski rental shops are noticing a lack of interest from customers, some rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people took to the running tracks and ski slopes in Liberec over the weekend.
Snow conditions were ideal for skiers and snowboarders who took to the slopes on a sunny day.
We are pleased that the opening weekend really took off from the Thursday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill, praised the director of the Sport Arena Ještěd, Jakub Hanuš.
People set off for the first weekend of skiing in the new season to Jeseniky.
For example, the Karlov Ski Arena and the Branná centre in Sumperk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
Conditions are dire.
Today the sun was shining, it was minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, representative of the Branná ski resort.
Resort operators will be able to sell ski passes only to people who are vaccinated or have had the disease for less than 21 days.
People are prepared for this, and they have the necessary documentation, said René Hroneš of the Špindlerův Mlýn Skicentre to CTK.
We recorded only incidents, he added.
Lower demand than before the pandemic is reported by some rental companies and ski equipment shops.
The interest in renting cross-country skis is high.
It's not like it used to be, but there are still customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Ostrava.
Greater pressure is expected during the skiing courses.
David Šinták, CEO of Snowbear, a company based in Hradec Králové, feels that there is less interest in renting ski equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before the pandemic, we were almost ready to start.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent there, said Šinták to CTK.
People according to him have panicked and learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, there is a big demand for loans at the Novako on Boží Dar.
Snowshoes were rented there last week and those interested have to book them in advance now.
We are starting to rent out trampolines this weekend, but people have been booking in advance, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like with the bouncy castle, said the owner of the trampoline park, Pavlína Nováková.
The interest is comparable to that before the epidemic, according to her, also for the ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like they would abroad.
This certainly does not belong to socialist healthcare, where it is not often possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Foreigners are leaving the country for chancers and yobs who have no assets here.
The owner of the company is not going to give up on the foreign market.
As for the rest, I completely agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with one beautiful day when Orban won, he ruled for a year and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
I naively thought that the Czech Republic could not find itself in the same position day after day.
Another issue is the elections.
When it will be nice there, some traditional V4 loony will win there.
The young and educated leave, but remain his supporters and people whose property cannot be stuffed into a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over beer wager?
While in the Czech Republic autumn was in full swing, in Thailand the film "The Island" starring Jiří Langmajer (55) was enjoying tropical weather!
Herec meanwhile posted a photo of his bloodied face on social media.
Is this a genuine injury, or is it staged for the cameras?
London police still searching for missing Czech woman
She was last seen heading home.
The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare, said Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth Police, in a statement released on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried and just wants to know where she is, she said.
The Czech national, who is wanted, is said to have left work at around 7.45pm on Sunday 28 November and headed home to her Camberwell flat.
She was spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on 3rd December.
Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, according to British media.
We are deeply concerned about the safety of our colleague, Petra, who is missing, the group of healthcare facilities said in a Twitter post.
We would like to appeal to anyone who was in the area who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
The public are also being urged to come forward with information by MP Harriet Harman, who raised the case of Srnka at a press conference on Saturday.
Missing for several days, she is just 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught, the Labour MP said, holding up a picture of the woman distributed by police in London.
I feel like we all have a great responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare, Harmanova said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the incident, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, however, police have not released any information about his identity or the charges he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and definitely not with 30 BTG (that is, with 5 divisions).
Neither do I, Ukraine.
It is not a huge amount, but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Remember that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of an invasion is increasing and begins to have full teeth on our entry.
I voted for him.
I don't know why Russia wants war.
War is expensive and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing the situation in 38 to the situation now is beyond me, I don't know where to start.
To už mohu srovnávat s prvou punskou válkou a "anexí" Sicílie :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreement, Russia annexed those silly republics.
This is how it is and this "concentration" at the borders corresponds to it.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
From Sunday new timetables will come into force in Prague, affecting mainly suburban trains
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport system (PID) can look forward to several changes from Sunday, which mainly affect suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed their routes, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is now joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, trains from Prague will stop at the Zahradní Město station in the city centre.
In suburban rail transport, the S7 trains will run, which will pass through Prague Main Station on the route from Beroun to Czech Brod.
The recently opened station of Prague-Zahradní Město will be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID is expanding into new areas.
In addition, buses will run to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladá Boleslav, including lines with overlaps into Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing lines will be changed.
From Zličín in Prague, a new bus line, number 405, will run to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
Trains will be staffed in the early morning and on weekends, with services from Prague to Rakovník, where a new express line, number 404, will run.
Lines 400 and 410, which run to Liberec, are now included in the PID system.
They are leaving from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovice station.
The main line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected trains continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 runs via Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, dozens of local railway lines in the Central Bohemian region, including Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, have been closed or restricted.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of railways, there will be long-term limitations on the lines of Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Passengers will also face changes at other locations.
Buses replace some of the discontinued railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of the Central Bohemian and Horažďovice regions in the Plzeň region have been altered.
Healthy lunch/dinner in the office from the supermarket
Hello, I work 9-5 with a 30 minute break and my only option for food is to walk down the road to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Given that I have no movement, no strength after work, I have to eat as healthily and diet-wise as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I buy things as fast as possible - pizza, cheese, yogurt and fruit.
Question: What would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket that is healthy without the need for thermal processing?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you, unfortunately.
It's not about trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the branch can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I don't know if it's the only reason they ban us from riding off-pavement, but it's one of them.
Admission about her relationship with Nedved: I really didn't want to talk about it
The Czech version of Keeping Up With The Kardashians will focus on the relationship between Daria Rolins and Pavel Nedved from Friday.
The pair have been dating since the summer, and the famous footballer even dumped his girlfriend for the singer.
Dara sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she had kept her love long from them.
I think it's safe to say that currently there is nobody in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would want to hide the fact that Dara caught a bear, that is, a pardon, a bear, says Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
However, he picked her up, not the other way around.
For three days, they are the center of attention, and even though they are used to it, they don't enjoy it.
This is it.
To, na co jsme se oba netěšili, ale věděli, že k tomu jednou dojde, pokračuje zpěvačka.
I don't know who is worse off.
If you, whoever you are, and you don't give a damn and throw it back in their face, or us, whose lives are torn apart by it.
As if someone would want to hear your opinion on whether or not you deserve to be with your husband or girlfriend, or if you're stubborn about everyone knowing your list of ex's and being up to date with your wrongs and mistakes.
That's enough, that's enough, it's enough, Dara.
The duo got together in Italy, where Rihanna was preparing for her new fashion collection.
Nedved is long-term Vice President of the football club Juventus there.
The truth only came out now because they were waiting for the Nedved divorce to be finalised.
He has been separated from his wife Ivana for three years, but they have only been officially divorced for three weeks.
In any case, to those who are happy with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we have both our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man and I stand by him, just like he stands by me, good and bad, Rolins said.
Hi, other commenters have probably said everything that's relevant by now, just confirming that halls are great to start with, my flatmates usually get to know each other quite well by the end of the first semester or two, and find flats together, which is the best option for me because you get to choose who you live with.
They usually don't advertise for too long in advance, so you won't find anything now, but it won't do any harm to take a look at the offer.
Jinak určitě se vyhni nejen Cejlu, ale i okolí (ulice jako Vranovská, Francouzská apod., to je dost špatná adresa), i některé části Židenic jsou trochu ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is full of students, Královo pole and that way it's great, besides it's close to most faculties of the VUT (I don't know where you're going exactly).
I've never rented a car before, but I'm a born Brňák, so I might be able to help you with Brno as such, if you're missing any information :)
This is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what some doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite all right that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or they go according to the state and pay the state.
We cannot allow private actors to take control of education just because they can get a few extra crowns from the state subsidy, so that they can teach what they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is made by a person who just two days before was expressing such sentiments about the boycott campaign against the totalitarian state:
Therefore, the voice against someone going for an abortion is the same as the voice against a statue standing in the square?
Because by that time I had already consulted with the man who was giving me the work.
I have already experienced this during cataloging/digitalization (and even long-time professionals) - either they find it acceptable or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to conventions) and add a note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not really recommend it.
I would have dealt with it myself by adding a note at the bottom of the page based on which program you were using.
If you want to be a law-abiding and diligent student, you can look up some sign language databases and find the nearest one.
Because it looks like you are drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own emblem, which sits alongside the physical coin.
PS: It is not a coincidence that it is the Odrian Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odrian one?
PSS: Someone already did that here.

Politicians do not know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
This is much worse than having a babysitter.
The idea that something would be approved because no-one understood any of the text is amusing.
All important documents are scrutinized word by word, and some basic knowledge of English is enough for that, that is the matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for informal communication among politicians, building extra-standard relationships.
Also with that Englishwoman it is quite interesting, after the UK has left the EU.
Put the hat on Cejl.
I have been working there for the third year and feel completely at ease.
I drive home from work at 10pm and have never had a problem.
Only someone who has never been there can say that it is a ghetto.
Jo, most of the Roma population in Brno live there, but the only thing they do is block the pavement and park where they shouldn't:D definitely not because I'd be scared to walk down the street at night there.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the centre, I'd be happy to help.
There are now newly reconstructed or newly built houses there.
Felix Slováček (78) bez Dády i milenky Gelemové jako kůl v plotě!
Who are you spending Christmas with?
On Sunday most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen the veil and Lucie definitely has one too, said the saxophonist, confirming Patrasova's words that she often visits.
He visits, but doesn't live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda is left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anicka, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
But we were still talking, so there was no Christmas.
I don't know where I'll be.
Dárky kupujem průběžně a Dádě i Lucii určitě něco koupím, například parfém.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the club Richman for the christening of the music video.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luďka Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
It is clear from the text.
If we were an island, would we allow soldiers and weapons?
We believe that someone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
So, why should that be a bad argument, tell me?
I don't know of any other component that could be used in hospitals during a crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, so the firemen and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level is.
To, that our army is capable of defending as much as Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for far too long.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the country is not just a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing its worst drought in years.
Water levels have dropped in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, according to scientists, and places that have not previously suffered from water shortages are also recording lower levels of rainfall.
The cause of the drought that has affected much of central Europe is climate change.
The consequences also strengthen the way in which we treat the soil.
What should be done in the event of a drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
It will be like that, just to keep my skates on the ice, mushrooms I know how to play hockey and that tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also overall hilarious.
If the hockey team "Russia the Bear" or "China the Lama" lose by two goals, even if they don't have to win the match at any cost, it's different than when they are tied.
Well, that's how it is, what I hear from Czech commentators, what the referees notice and what they don't, whether it's male or female hockey, it's all very strange, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors", or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
There is controversy everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be the same as always, and that the Czech Republic usually loses to Russia more often than it wins, it would be a classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of cases in Russia exceeds 1 million
On Saturday 11th December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, with another 74.
There have been 1,967 confirmed cases in the last 14 days and 871 in the last week in the Czech Republic.
Number of cases in Russia exceeded 1 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been registered.
This is the lowest daily total since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the start of October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" large wave of cases of COVID-19 caused by Omikron, said Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical officer for Public Health England, on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with the Omicron strain are already being hospitalized in the UK, and Hopkins expects that number to grow.
No one has died from Omicron yet, but people are being hospitalized about 14 days after exposure and dying about three weeks after exposure.
The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said on Sunday that Mr Johnson had probably broken the law by staging a Christmas quiz in Downing Street alone in December, when the country was on lockdown and Christmas parties were banned.
Every minister in Johnson's government has defended the quiz as having taken place "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by Downing Street staffers gathered around computers.
Pressure mounts on Johnson to resign as PM in UK
During December last year, when London was put into strict lockdown and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers staged a series of meetings in defiance of the lockdown.
British public and media outraged that Johnson and his government made light of them:
Paul Brand, commercial TV editor for ITV in the UK: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide majority in the general election.
Today the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from office.
It's remarkable how quickly things escalated.
Want to tan and save your skin?
Hungary is looking ahead to spring elections that could bring an end to Viktor Orban's 12-year-old government.
The elections will be of European significance.
How long will it take for them to be fair?
Didn't work out.
Perhaps they were not even free, because such were not even the last two elections under Orban.
His Fidesz party controls the media, redraws constituency boundaries to its advantage, and pulls other small or large stunts.
So far, the last one states that in practice, everyone can choose where they want.
To enable Fidesz to drag voters from safe constituencies into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So just to clarify, there will be no men.
Do you think it will be the same as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about whether Fidesz would win or not, but now it's about how much and whether it will have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and seats will be won by the united opposition.
This is unprecedented for Viktor Orban and his party.
Did they try even harder to keep their power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, in which the heads of secret services claim that opposition is a threat to national security.
What are those signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of those new things.
It all starts with language.
I've been biting my nails a lot lately, the last time was on the 14th, my mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my grandfather has a long time, but then he bites extremely (just in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in hysterics and was completely blue, to the point where they had to take me out of the bath twice to calm me down.
From time to time I was beaten at school, sometimes it was more of a beating than others.
Definitely nowadays I also have a tendency to solve things by force, like when I was little I was very tidy, nowadays I'll do anything to get rid of at least something, like plucking my parents' hair through their hands (so they don't have too much control over me), so I never do anything extreme, but always the urge to do it.
I cannot determine to what extent this is my own explosiveness, but it certainly has something to do with my upbringing.
I fear that I would lose my patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think having kids is just plain wrong and my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that time when it wasn't "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent does something stupid, maybe it's impossible not to screw up your kids at least a little, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't bother me, I don't understand why he should be ashamed of it.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I would call you what creates laws in such quality.

Will Slovakia extradite journalist Kuciak's killer to the Czech Republic?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the double murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
Death of investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia
It stimulated civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman, Marian Kočner, and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.

Another government ends and the law on involving municipalities in selecting a depository is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were taken into account when selecting and approving a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council suspended consideration of the bill, which the government had presented to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after protracted discussions.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against the deep geological repository, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Samosprávy očekávají výraznější posílení svých možností při rozhodování o úložišti, jaké je starostům slibováno od roku 2011, kdy první práce na této legislativě začaly a které požaduje český atomový zákon i evropská směrnice.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the draft in cooperation with municipalities.
The law proposal from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available on the Platform, is criticised by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process regarding the selection of a location for a storage facility is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective when communities or the public can influence whether a process will go ahead in a given location.
To ensure the fulfillment of the obligation of the Depositary to request the consent of the affected municipalities prior to the commencement of specific proceedings.
The submitted draft resolution practically ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens practically mere statistics in the decision-making process.
The proposal lacks systematic compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a location for the storage facility, its approval and operation.
Representatives of municipalities do not have many options in practice to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a landfill.
In some licensing proceedings, they may submit their objections or appeal, but the final decision rests with the office or minister in whose interest the licence is being issued.
The potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on conducting exploratory or construction works.
Spolurozhodování samospráv, které Platforma žádá, je princip, který je běžně používán v mnoha demokraticky vyspělých zemích a rozhodně pak v těch, kde již pokročili v povolování úložiště, jako ve Švédsku nebo Finsku.
Preparation of the law is another failure of state administration, which outsources the preparation of legislation to external law firms.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which SÚRAO concluded and which follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemanek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works is almost 4 million korunas.
Antonín Seknička, mayor of the town of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson for the Platform against a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste said: After the Ministers of Industry, who simply passed on to their successors the problem of the position of local authorities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste, we are waiting for the new government to take a decisive step.
We are offering our help.
We would also like to thank the Association of Cities and Municipalities, which, like the directly affected municipalities in selected locations, recognises the problem of inadequate rights for municipalities in such a fundamental construction.
The Nuclear Waste Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) with the aim of promoting a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repositories.
The platform also advocates that decisions on the selection of locations for potential storage be conditional upon the prior agreement of the affected municipalities.
Herce Johna Goodmana (69) donutil k hubnutí strach: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for a long time, doctors eventually scared him.
He was told that if he didn't stop, he would die.
A to zabralo.
Goodman gradually shed 90kg, half his original weight of 180kg, The Sun reports.
He introduced his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The guy who played the bartender on Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family urged him to put on weight because his big frame was causing the furniture to break.

It depends on which boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it is about some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it was, for example, a formal text, such as a university text, I would look for a way to describe the boss in a more concise manner.
There are different types of bosses.
Games like Dark Souls, for example, have several bosses that you have to beat, so the "boss" is something like a lord / ruler of that level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super bosses), who are not necessary to beat in order to complete the game or level, but are often much stronger than the regular bosses.
There are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), so how do you even call them?
No, they are mini bosses.
Ono paušálně jednoslovně nějak přeložit boss prostě ani nejde, čeština a ani jiné jazyky to nějak neřeší (zajímavá je třeba tak jen katalánština, která bosse překládá jako finálního protivníka).
In a nutshell, the story or game is generally significant, computer-controlled, the opponent is much stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
Missing Petra from London is being searched for worldwide.
The Czech police have also been involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3.
The Czech police have also been involved in the search.
A 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been missing since 7th December.
Interpol is also helping the British police.
Her colleagues last saw Petra Srncova on 28th November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
The Czech police cooperates closely with the British police, confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
We are sharing information on the case, she said.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, slim, has brown eyes and long straight hair the same colour.
Pocházela z Uherskohradišťska.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman also joined in the search.
She became involved in putting up posters with Petra's face on them.
We have tremendous concerns, she said at the Saturday press briefing.
In connection with this, the British police arrested one suspect.
However, it is not clear who is going and what they have in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight drop in offensive campaigns, attacks increased significantly in the past month as the year draws to a close.
We noticed a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on 18th November.
The attacks are specifically targeting the Czech Republic.
Attackers' strategies remain the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is designed to grab the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While the previous month had the dangerous suffix 'faktura' in its name, this time it was marked as 'Kopie oprav účtenky za 11,2021...exe', said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The most recent strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and end of the year, the activity of the attackers once again increases.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not targeting the Czech Republic specifically, and security experts caught the global campaign in November.
In comparison with the Formbook figures for November, the figures for the month of October weakened slightly, but still account for almost half of all detections.
Attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on days 3, 10 and 15.
The form book contained the most frequently used annex with the suffix .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, there is also the name of the invoice.
The add-on could be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts monitoring the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 per cent of attacks, have not seen a major campaign in the Czech Republic for several months.
Today's snowflake millennials, who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated babies.
The Prague Process was bigger than the media make out.
According to footage of the parade and my own experience as a demonstrator, I estimate that around 10,000 people took part.
People in the parade filled the embankment and the bridge and the adjoining promenade.
This means that there are a lot of people.
In the wake of around 40,000 demonstrators, an unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joined in.
I believe that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The long-standing dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population has led to them finding common ground.
Lone antivaxers, antirouters and co. couldn't even fill that big parade, let alone pay for it.
The action of the "Chcipl Pes" society is gaining popularity, reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy campaign.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same podium and equipment.
It's hard to say which movement would benefit from this dissatisfaction, as it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine becomes a quadruple and more dose vaccine.
Definitely not a left-wing or centrist movement, get over it.
The trivalent vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will have to wait for each half-year.
I'm very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant move by scientists, on which humanity has a right to be proud.
End of an era, Bulgaria has new PM promising change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev appointed Kiril Petkov, leader of the anti-corruption "Continue the Change" movement, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
Tomu se podařilo sestavit vládu široké koalice, která by měla nastoupit do úřadu během pár dní.
Political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost elections amid anti-corruption protests.
The winning parties, who campaigned against corruption and abuse of power, could not agree on a coalition, so there were two early elections.

The footage shot secretly is a global hit.
Over the weekend, fears grew for the safety of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing in London for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the southern British city.
Besides the police, the woman's former employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lives is also being contacted for information.
The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare, said Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth Police, in a statement released on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried and just wants to know where she is, she said.
The Czech national, who is wanted, is said to have left work at around 7.45pm on Sunday 28 November and headed home to her Camberwell flat.
She was spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on 3rd December.
Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, according to British media.
We are deeply concerned about the safety of our colleague, Petra, who is missing, the group of healthcare facilities said in a Twitter post.
We would like to appeal to anyone who was in the area who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.

In Ústí nad Labem, a month-long hole appeared in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was a matter of life and death.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), which is responsible for the road, but no action was taken.
In the end, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began to "intensively deal with the situation".
