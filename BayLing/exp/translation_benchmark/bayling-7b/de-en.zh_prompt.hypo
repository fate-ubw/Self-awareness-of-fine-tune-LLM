The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the wholesale value...
I am a large customer of #PRS_ORG# and therefore it is not a problem for me.
All I need is a tracking number or instructions on how to label the package so it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a few days ago... for €249.
Today it costs €179.
I find that very annoying to be honest.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get the refund?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is good for big brothers and sisters to look after the little ones to a certain extent.
Look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still have enough children, I see no problem there.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You are best placed to judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
Just legally, it's probably dubious.
This is where the psychologist comes in.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would be too much responsibility for K1 to look after K2.
Whether it is now a risk you are willing to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and while I can still remember almost the entire plot, I can't for the life of me remember the title. Can anyone help?
The history is about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in feed and going into the enclosure with the big cats.
The case is taken up by a commissioner, who, after a short investigation, turns to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and goes to this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients ultimately confront their fears to an extreme degree.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to her death)
This is described in the book as "the fight."
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that was set on fire.
That is roughly the plot I am pretty sure the book was written by a French author/writer.
If this action is known to someone or if someone even knows the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
First I have to contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the little finger
Kind, four years, has splinters of wood under the fingernail (on the outside).
They tried to pull him with a pincer.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work out and I got hurt.
Now the child is hysterical when we try to do it.
No chance.
Tomorrow I'm going to see the doctor.

Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to press ahead with booster vaccinations
New cases of COVID-19 are causing concern in politics and science in the UK.
As a result, by New Year's Day, all eligible adults in England will have been offered the jab.
London - The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, wants to accelerate the rollout of coronavirus vaccinations in light of rapidly increasing omega numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to have a booster by the end of the year, provided they have had at least three months since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to the nation on Sunday evening.
Up until now the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK Government will also provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the Omega variant, mankind is in a state of emergency and it is imperative that we strengthen our vaccination programme, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be raised again with a third dose of the vaccine.
Let's boost now, said Johnson.
An additional 1,239 cases of Omikron were registered in Great Britain on Sunday, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am in favour of everyone using pronouns
I have sent in an application.
Today, the invitation came via email.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
However, unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and according to where he/she has a cultural background from, it's either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on the toes of any officials.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine pronouns.
I have 5 books in total.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Clearly the chair had a non-visible defect when sold.
How can a mattress stain appear after 9 months otherwise?
First attempt on the #PRS_ORG.
However, this has been the case since approximately
14 days left.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, they are no longer available.
Now they are back in stock and I would like to add 2 chairs to my order and charge it to my account.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content Warning: I am going to write a bit more about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from my soul.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately happens way too often is that many victims don't help themselves or think we can't help them.
To me it is clear that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in those situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social circle, fear of taking the children away from this.
What I want to make clear to everyone is that it is worth living without violence, even if it is very close to tears.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just take abuse.
Often I wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
However, it will never be light.
Please remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so important.
Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking opening: "Arcane," the series set in the "League of Legends" video game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the hands of the Merlins Crailsheim
At least for the youngster, Johannes Patrick, there was hope.
Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, looking back to the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, they did not throw in the towel - quite the opposite, in fact, given the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, the manner of the performance was a disappointment.
To illustrate, a statistic is cited that encapsulates the entire dilemma: the conversion rate was a mere 13 per cent, four goals (all by young Johannes Patrick) from 31 attempts - any more questions?
The response came from John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after winning in Tenerife and didn't do what we practised".
In other words, to move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, had a completely different reaction: "It's great to win a second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
He felt like he was in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 spectators were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their own expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered his team to victory.
The best playmaker I have ever coached, praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line.
Only in the final quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete debacle, coming within eight points after being 39:59 down.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to brood.
Already on Wednesday (8:00 p.m.), the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected there.
We have re-checked our legal position and have written to them again.
We registered about half a year ago.
As if from an egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He can inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is travelling with the programme "Good morning, dear luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing came of it.
The planned concert has been postponed until May 2022 - "on the instructions of the authorities" - in order to combat the Coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent period must also be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists will then pick up their postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12th December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing since he was a youngster.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palace Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair slicked back and a keen eye for detail, Max Raabe is no longer a figure that can be ignored in the current German-language music scene.
Since 2020, he has been touring with the programme "Good morning, dear luck". dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
They are to be completed with existing furniture and so we can check whether they match in terms of colour beforehand.
It still doesn't work, I can only long for the table of contents but can't browse it.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Nationalisation does not create new homes
New Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a Berlin referendum.
With expropriation, no single new home is created, it just changes the ownership structure, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My aim is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
A mix of private landlords, cooperatives and housing associations, for example, is the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages rent controls until 2029, limits on rent increases in tight housing markets and widening the rental sector.
I will be talking to the Attorney General about this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not pick up despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the USA.
More than 100 could be dead in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
Several tornadoes tore through the U.S. overnight Saturday, causing widespread damage and possibly killing as many as 100 people.
Storms leave a roughly 230-mile path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster zone that everything was gone everywhere the tornado went.
Homes, shops, government buildings - just get rid of them.
Industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to believe that this is even possible.
He is estimating that as many as 100 people died in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official death toll is rising by the minute.
Hello, I just saw that the display case #NAME# is sold out.

If the delivery cannot be brought to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or had initiated a return and wanted to inquire whether it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine fees and change ad slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine reward, companies in Austria have taken matters into their own hands, offering their employees money to get vaccinated.
They are on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today are calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - is also intended to increase readiness for the Corona vaccination.
He moved to a company where he was berated.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year.
He has clearly not stuck to his old job and has been looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: who cares.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign
Excuse me!
I'm currently running an adventure for a group of 4 friends over the Greifenpass and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written especially for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are designed and now I'm writing the opening adventure and stumble already over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran Lake.
Further action is to take place there.
Some miles away from the village, a group of goblins ambush and lure the hero into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, detecting the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 normal goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords.
The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a sunken lane and, armed with bows, flank the wagon from left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and subsequently found and revived by the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, long gone.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf and two of his knights leap to the hero's aid.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you justify your Deus ex Machina solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an adventure starter?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
"EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips."
I'm guaranteed to carry out many of your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put them back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd love to send them back anyway.
Can you then send the returns, then I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm fed up with Sky Sports F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality of the German Sky has been deteriorating more and more, so I wanted to take a little break with this post.
First of all, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to begin the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the start was delayed and there was an accident, the schedule was still far behind the plan, but they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to give way to it, which is why Sky DE had no choice but to do so.
Nevertheless, stupidly, especially as Sky UK covered the race to the finish.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has done a good job of accompanying the difficult situation caused by the serious accident.
Then there was a lapse in understanding of the rules by commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that tyres can be changed under a red flag.
Though it happened in Imola, Baku and Silverstone earlier this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change his tyres only when Hamilton received relevant radio messages to that effect.
Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that this was an option for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such basic rules if one is commentating on a pay-TV F1 channel.
It is also not the first riddle that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties about the rules.
Generally, Roos's artificial commentary style does not appeal to him, but he acknowledges that it is a matter of taste.
But even Heiko Wasser from RTL appeals to me seriously.
There are also constant yawns, which make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee for reporter Peter Hardenacke, or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular is causing a lot of trouble in the comments, which he obviously doesn't take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply gets the upper hand on Sky, in the closing stages, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, on F1TV, you can only listen to the German commentary, without commentary, directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
These two channels also do less advertising in their training than Sky, and as free-to-air channels.
While one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 schedule is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of F1.
In a tongue-in-cheek move, RTL will do a better job of covering the four races it is still allowed to show, advertising excepted.
So anyway, the grand F1 season is a lot less fun than it could be with a reasonable broadcaster.
Mich would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she was going to review and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short period (the material has a hole at the front of the chair).
I beg for support.
Air pumps are ideal for adding oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to drive a filter system using an air cylinder.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the bottom of the table.
There you can compare performances.
If the pumps are strong enough, the whole plant can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, it is advisable to have pumps with 2 or more outlets so that you can connect multiple ejectors.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fans are also available for use in aquariums to create a focal point, for example with an air curtain (find them in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, mussel or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The blower pump is connected to an exhaust pipe 4/6 mm via an air hose ... and then it can get going.
The blower pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the blower pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between the blower pump and the water level.
Cut the air hose in two and put the valve between them.
This would prevent water from flowing backward if it were to somehow get into the toilet bowl through the pump...
If the fan is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other fans, be covered and protected from moisture.
MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Although we state here on ebay that the processing time is 3 days, the items are packed daily and the packages are picked up daily here.
If everything is going well when you are travelling, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little bit of a bow, so that nobody is upset, just because it took a little bit longer.
That's how it is, not everyone has sympathy for all the employees who also work in logistics...of course, here, no-one is stopping for Corona.
Please do not rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is down to the courier service.
Of course people like to moan about these services, even though at the moment we are saying...they are struggling
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there are better days ahead.
how long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?
Did you know that you can also have your legs tanned here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and TV presenter into space
The daughter of the first US astronaut in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a clear blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed back the newly selected astronauts.
Welcome back, Bezos said, wearing a blue jumpsuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for ten minutes and thirteen seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much each paid for their tickets, Blue Origin wouldn't say.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He has had to work hard and do everything himself in his appearances.
She was simply along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back into space again, the presenter said.
New Shepard will fly to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system is flown largely automatically.
The capsule detached from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the atmosphere and space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was the third manned test flight by Blue Origin: the first in July saw Amazon founder Bezos on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was there, as was former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's vice president Audrey Powers.
Critics say Bezos and Blue Origin are pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the betterment of humanity and with little regard for the climate.

Changing colour, the glow stone retains its light colour for around a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative colour.
The robust construction of the "Smart Stone" chandelier means that it can be left outside all year round.
In a snow-covered environment, their light is particularly good – they can be expected to have a shorter flash duration as soon as the days get shorter.
Please ensure in the winter that no snow interferes with the functioning of the solar module.
Smart Stone uses a NiMh battery in the standard AA format, which is easily replaceable if needed.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry.
I'm currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and I find the subject quite exciting, even in the lab (I've already completed my organic chemistry practical).
I have of course also already informed myself about career prospects before studying, but at the time I also still thought that I would definitely study until my doctorate and become a professor.
However, at the moment, I have doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear about great career opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand you hear about unemployed biologists and extremely poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
What are you working on at the moment?
Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
What have you studied/What training have you had?
Would you do that again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer specialist.
If you have any experience, please write it down :)
Extra Stress before holiday and weekend
This topic came up last week for me.
However, I had to make use of my long weekend to relax.
Only now are they putting a post in.
There's not just the big holidays, like Christmas, that cause stress at work.
It seems that there is also an additional day before holidays plus bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
It was a long four-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails that absolutely had to be sent before the start of the working week, orders here, orders there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" after all that time doesn't sound right?
Or is it because people want to get as much done in a shortened week as they would in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also extremely nervous.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can't give them to ourselves?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent like that.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones like this, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
The beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by baking and basting with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
However, she still has a lot to do in the run-up to Christmas: "I haven't got any presents yet, I really must get a move on".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth mating and re-growth of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio provides the bird with a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in aviculture is attributed to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feather is composed of protein substance, a particularly rich and balanced diet of protein is necessary for the formation of a flawless feather.
For a functioning metabolism, daily nutrition must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of Nekton-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of Nekton-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be administered simply through drinking water or animal feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the loco was in service in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare loco probably originates from the conversion proposal in the Model Engineer (ME) magazine, issue 11/1968, complete with play tracks and missing parts, see photos, functioning well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Federal Railway (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also originates from the small-scale manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BAC
A locomotive is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and has been restored to operational condition.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to come up with proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Therefore, in March 1926, the DRG decided to deliver the locomotive as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with taper-lever drive, supplied by AEG with the mechanical components, and by Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical components.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were supplied, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the former GDR afterwards.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk (Imperial Railway Repair Shop) in Dessau, the reparability of all six locomotives was established.
With the increasing electrification of the middle German network, there was a growing need for locomotives for heavy goods traffic. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the remaining machines serving as spares.
Firstly, preference was given to the construction of E04, E44 and E94, which were available in larger quantities.
It was only when it became clear that the number of repairs on the E 94 could not be increased any further that the E 95 came into focus for refurbishment.
The locomotives were initially stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They came to the railway workshop in Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own timetable, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complex control of the locomotives became problematic.
It was not uncommon for shooters to stay put during ceasefires.
Then Beimann, who was always travelling on this locomotive, had to hammer and chisel the lock open during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and resulted in the locomotive being out of service for months at a time.
[5] By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new build locomotives available and there were no plans to extend electrification at that time, so the Bundesbahn was able to do away with old locomotives and most of the split-gauge types, so the E 95s were taken out of service.
They added that the German Federal Railway only wanted to operate electric locomotives with a single crew, which would have caused a problem for train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and visibility from the cab.
[5] After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01, which retired on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255,001 was never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a signal heater in the main train station in Halle.
It was not until some time later that the authorities at the railway were convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive underwent initial external restoration work with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The internal completion of the locomotive was carried out in 1986.
The locomotive is looked after by the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community of Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented to an exhibition in the Museum Bw Arnstadt for the first time, with a new internal and external livery, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable and easy to maintain.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig, to the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, functioning well, optical repairs to the loco done in-house, dirty, with ballast, musty smell!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also came from the small-scale company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may bear labels and storage marks.
Yes the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of them.
The central beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these feet are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them.
What are we going to do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held up by two feet, which unfortunately were produced incorrectly.
The central beam does not fit into the planned bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out then?
No, no flats.
According to the instructions for assembly, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But who cares?
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
They are not flat for me.
Could I have received this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Dwelling fire with two minor injuries and significant damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated amount of damage in the six-figure Euro range was caused, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire is said to have spread from a carport onto the neighbouring house in Kinsau (Landsberg district).
Two residents were taken to hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday, according to the statement.
The precise cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
However, it arrives much later.
And I have to pay shipping again.
To combat fake news - Biotech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin shared a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social networking site LinkedIn.
Biontech head chef Uğur Şahin has not yet made any public statements about his vaccination status.
Now the businessman has shared a photo of himself receiving the Coronavirus vaccine.
A friend's illness prompted him to share, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Sahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter the fake news.
Up until now he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to hear that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust.
Angst is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with German World Service is doing the rounds on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
At the moment it is not legally possible for me to get the vaccine myself, said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, prioritisation has long been a thing of the past – and according to his own information, the biontech boss has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer substation: Ten thousand people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and, in many cases, no heating.
A fire had brought a power substation to a standstill.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communes on Friday evening.
Supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disturbance was finally completely repaired late in the evening.
Members of the fire brigade and the THW provided assistance in the communities.
Authorities offered support at schools and appealed for neighbourly help.
The provider expressed gratitude to those affected for their patience and to the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant disruption.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless work," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz installers were initially only able to put some cables back into service provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical fault led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 19:15 on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary there.
A connection to a 30,000-volt level has also been created.
With the help of this bypass, power supply has been restored.
Since 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30 p.m.
Since 9.15 p.m. power has also been restored to those last affected by the outage.
More than 80 Westnetz and partner company employees were deployed.
Following the construction of emergency power supplies for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from the local community.
What is important now is that citizens look out for the elderly or people living alone in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed, said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) following a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of retirement homes were the main focus.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed electrical medical devices or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the daytime ceiling #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and stay safe ♡
However, I cannot mount the underside on the tabletop.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 explanations for this.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, however, I can't push and thus shorten this.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return it, as it is not suitable for its intended purpose.
I would be delighted to hear back from you.
That is really easy!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by post?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before purchasing it.
Should I do it now?
I find it almost shameful to have such a low credit balance.
We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
German nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have made it onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo once again had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started the cross-country race with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be refunded to my account?
Yes we have both re-done and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem.
Just bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG, it seems to be interested in it.
Sobal ich es öffnen möchte kommt die Meldung, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, they report to the customer service.
As far as I can tell it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
Chat connection is away and now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure the paint job is evenly and cleanly applied, you should clean the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the non-visible inner side of the components or on a yoghurt pot.
The first stroke on the building component
Paint evenly, stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the colour layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid rapid brush strokes with the brush.
This leads to unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colours.
The dark ones could come through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours come to a head with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metallic streaks when mixed with normal colours.
Leave the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve their original appearance through decals or stickers.
From airplane emblems to ship names to license plates on automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch.
Put the decals on in the right order while the parts are still accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be or can be more easily accommodated before being fitted into the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and pincettes are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut each required decal out individually and apply them to your model.
Decals are also called water transfer decals, because you wet the back of the decal for a few seconds until the carrier paper turns dark through the moisture.
Then you just peel the image off the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways away.
Attention: Always check if the picture is in the right place before you try to remove it completely from the paper, so that it does not stick, knit or even tear.
Collect excess water with a towel.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look at something else, I can't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in again and load the book again and find the place where I left off reading.
AM Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Will I get this via email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
Thanks anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
However, can I get it back without any problems?
Infertility treatment for PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, now that it's time to deal with the PKV bill, suddenly this pops up.
One by one:
We had applied for the desire to have children in advance with the PKV and were successful with 3 attempts.
The attempts were in no way restricted (e.g. in terms of time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was covered by the PKV.
A few months later we tried for a second child, and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not include the PKV in these calculations.
We re-applied for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were again allowed 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have done more trials than promised, logically excluding the most expensive ones from the PKV) we sent the bills to the PKV and received the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV will only reimburse 3 trials.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second pregnancy is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with the commencement of treatment, and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
Questions to the experts in the round here:
Who is right, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the agreements that with a birth the further attempts would fail?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance claim?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants per email and tell me how I can achieve them best again
Fine.
We will no longer order anything from them.
When they add up sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address) they've obviously lost a good customer.
They would like to pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
Well, I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely wrecked when it arrives with me
Please see the screenshot of what your colleague wrote.
It is clear and evident that the repayment was made and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG
They can inform their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will no longer be doing that.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty lasts for 24 months.
No, I am unable to obtain any other type of packaging.
I will take the cupboard down and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG series.
These products are advertised with additional purchasing hooks, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly is a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what do you perhaps not like at all?
"I am a very good customer of yours, I have already completed 2 apartments with your furniture."
Wanted to get the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I then give up, because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
Half victory' against Belarus comes at high cost for EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Protestant Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, explained the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus isn't giving much away, but the EU feels it's getting a good deal - is likely to continue for a while.
The treatment of people on the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Clearly there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to do so, this will come at the cost of rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
She can't get her way when a member state decides to do its own thing, like Poland, which doesn't even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its borders.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again
According to information from the Polish border guards, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory from Belarus.
55 migrants were detained overnight on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the authorities said on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones near the town of Czeremsza by migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had managed to overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU is accusing Alexander Lukashenko of being the ruler in Minsk, luring them with the prospect of visa-free travel to the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened to ban airlines from flying migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to countries of origin to prevent people leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
So the EU has thrown its market muscle into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is unlikely to be prepared for the security service to regularly herd thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finish
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suggest two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to a perceived infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in line with regulations.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap to take his first Formula 1 title.
The move came just after the end of a safety car period, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I check that.
I'm talking to the bank and re-registering myself with you
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europe Park is organising a SC Freiburg fan day
The Europa Park, the name giver for the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport Club Freiburg, has invited SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the press release, members and long-term ticket holders of the Swabian Sport Club, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains were red and white that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga club and the holiday camp, which is located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it was once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Fans glowing with excitement as they enjoy the rollercoaster together confirm that," says Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann reads from her novel "Heim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note, and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and listens attentively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I haven't received any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time to deal with your cluttered chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Their error, which they are correcting and not all from our budget.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted and agreed that I, or Mrs. #NAME#, would receive an email with a 60-euro voucher, a repeat order for the #PRS_ORG# Night Table, and a return label.
This e-mail has not arrived yet.
The package wants to bring #PRS_ORG today.

Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicle.
Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite does not mean it is not true.
It is like when an AfD politician says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it alone.
Yeah wow then you are just as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
In any case, a god has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist you have to believe the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just a pack of lies.
And therefore you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the microscope should be as close to the eye as possible.
The specifically apochromatic-achromatic lens system enables you to use the microscope almost error-free, right up to the edge of the field of view.
Often scopes will have magnification markings.
However, these figures only apply to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your microscope, please note the specifications in the "Technical Data" table (refer to the instructions manual in the packaging).
Reflections occur on the surface of all optical devices - even in the case of pinhole cameras.
Antireflective coatings reduce these reflections considerably.
Reflections on the lens surfaces become less noticeable if the lenses are used at the optimal distance - close to the eye.

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farm owner Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling beech wood.
One man even drove home alone, without his partner, because they couldn't agree.
He plants around 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
This always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit of fun, he says.
And the voucher?
Otherwise I'm a customer?!
Nevertheless, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better restaurant, but there is a similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have therefore been named.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, now I have problems setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Prior to this, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used the Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit without any dropouts.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, on the other DLan module, which transmits Wi-Fi, the full 500 no longer comes through, but the less I move away from the module (i.e. a socket which is 1, 2, 3 etc. rooms away from the other module), the less comes through.
This means that with the new fibre-optic connection, the internet is now slower on the first floor than it was before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
While this was slightly better than the DLan, there were still significant losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with glass fibre over the power cable?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to move the LAN cables in that house.
I'm really at the end of my tether, which is why I've created an account here especially.
Therefore, I would be even more delighted to receive an answer.
When is it time to change your current account?
Anyone who thought that the Giro accounts would remain quiet for a while is in for a surprise.
While many banks have taken advantage of the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past once again with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also going down.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of €100,000.
Now she has halved her free bet allowance and even quartered her daily allowance.
In a first step, the border was only lowered for customers of the postal service subsidiary Postbank - to EUR 50,000 for current accounts and investment accounts, and EUR 25,000 for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower free allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank was previously already down to a limit of €50,000, which still applies, as does the limit at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free allowance in two stages, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
Nevertheless: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now offer a free allowance of €25,000 or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute there with consumer centres, who have won in the first instance at the Berlin District Court against this regulation.
Now the banks are discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that even the highest authorities declare the negative interest rates to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army at her disposal
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, the success of 2021, which included the Friends reunion and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are devoted to her appearance.
Still, says Aniston, she'll treat herself to a chip a day (yes, really: a single chip out of the bag).
That she has the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a wonder.
Maybe because she's just been unlucky in love - and still searching for the big love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
People asking have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame bring happiness.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn peels off his gloves and wipes sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight brush with the wall, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after just half the race distance at the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final grand prix, the "Iceman" ending his career at the top level of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from pole and finished on the podium 103 times.
Friedrich has 60 World Cup wins - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete, Ole Einar Björndalen, with 94 wins, is the target for the bob pilot.
I've worked it out, I'd need to win nine and a half races per season, and then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
Firstly, he defended himself against Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by five hundredths, moving up from third to first.
He changed something in the material setup and drove out in front by 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian, Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and it paid off, said Friedrich, who also stretched his winning run to 22 matches in a row.
Berchtesgaden's Johannes Lochner, who rides for Stuttgart, came in fifth after taking second place previously.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach came in eighth after taking fourth place in the first race.
If I knew what else he did, I would do it too, Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took third place in the women's two-man bob on her home track.
After finishing in fourth place the day before in the monobob, on Sunday she raced to victory in the World Cup with her partner Deborah Levi.
The Olympic champion in the two-woman bob, Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thüringen, came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she recorded her first podium finish of the winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki took third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, my first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is coming with me.
I'm really happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It is not just about pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little irritated by the not entirely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the ceiling in my shopping basket and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I haven't received it yet, that's why I haven't been able to cash it, that's why I finally asked.
Last year, because of Corona, I had other problems and never had the time.
And now it was said that he had left, which really annoyed me.
Looking at the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again since it's on sale :)
Why is the despatch not started until 16th March?
Nothing about long delivery times on your website
No, only if I press enter comes an extra field with the message
Was removed by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new unused one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I've got a lot of things I want to write down and maybe it will help others too...
I am 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student and a dog mum - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together for 6J) is ill, he got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burns).
He is also very cold and we see each other less (1-2 times a week) which is very difficult for me with my need for affection and love.
My dog is suffering from stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heater and stroking him.
I am living alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have to do the housework, which we of course split up between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is doing really well at the moment, I'm doing really well in therapy and I'm getting by.
Not good, but I am managing and am almost symptom free.
My uni is asking for a lot at the moment (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything and the day after tomorrow I have anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room left in my head.
So goes my week: Just until tomorrow morning, then it's the weekend.
But then what?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental cues because otherwise I'd just pack it in.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do otherwise...
How about you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really, endlessly grateful, I can't even express it in words.
I don't know whether I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that has a lot to do with women's mental load and that's why I thought I'd find some kindred spirits here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I got my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was the same colour as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get other colours or what?
The cancellation email was sent on #DATE#.
Other two times.
However, this was not confirmed.
It was completely different: When I was at school I realised that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it was just another subject like maths or geography.
For me it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was brought up as a Christian and I always believed in some way.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
I fundamentally understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a syllabus, etc.
But it would also seem strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?
That is already very long, then I would give up
That's good, thank you.
I expect to hear back from you soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a film.
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (in uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason or another, their paths cross and something happens.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can survive.
I think the transition is also the soldier's final resting place.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If you say so, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on their stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child can take more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly animals, sometimes go in and look, but no minute surveillance.
That's insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good bed.
No pillows.
And ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child while they sleep.
Turn your head to the side?
Can they sort themselves out from the inside?
Or is it lying face down on the mattress?
You can derive from this whether everything is in order.
We've all grown up and as my husband came into the world, it was all hands on deck to put the kids to sleep on your stomach.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought many articles.
But why are you offering me only 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues yesterday and have yet to receive any response.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cupboard.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not in use.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has a lot to offer.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this station is now beneath contempt.
Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour.
It was said that it was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "You don't want to be a running gag."
What are you now?
An 0815 advertiser trying to sell his BillOfMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's dos and don'ts.
Naturally, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course they can carry on insulting people.
Ein Krogmann is completely lacking in empathy and, at the expense of the action with the exploded rented premises, attempts to make a name for himself.
How does one find all that good?
Toll if you like it, I find it horrible.
I beg your pardon, as my delivered wooden table was defective.
Body break due to damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG.
Whether as a source of comfort for stomach ache or simply for cuddling – my little heat source is versatile and can be used in many different ways.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing painful conditions, as Kirschkerns can absorb and release heat very well.
The detachable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or oven.
The soft connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel at home, even when things aren't going so well for them.
The Kirschkern cushion with reference is suitable exclusively for the following applications:
Check for unusual smells, stains or burn marks before heating the kettle, and dispose of it immediately if any are found.
Please remove the inner cushion to warm it up!
In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (observe the manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking it!
Next, lower the seatback.
During the first heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Absolutely stick to the given heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before warming up the kisses in the microwave, check the manufacturer's instructions to see if heating of cereal products is allowed.
After the heated inner cushion has been repositioned, please check the temperature of the cushion on your forearm to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C)!
Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulation problems, fresh haematomas, bleeding and open wounds, and for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour conditions, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose kernels have come out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly checked during use to avoid overheating!
All serious adverse events related to the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant regulatory authority in the country where the user is registered.
The connection is detachable and washable at 30°C in the machine.
Please observe the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first half - Pauli win in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 are allowed to dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach.
Cheers in Darmstadt following the late win in the top match, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt following the failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped being charged through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone is enough to operate.
Faulty, the battery is empty and the laptop will not start despite being plugged in.
So I took the battery out, but still nothing.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop online?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG delivery in my room.
How do I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat height is...
Travelling a lot and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
It can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And anything else you need for everyday use is kept well organised and separable from the photographic equipment, thanks to the practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is a given - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while granting instant access to photo gear.
It works in two ways: conventionally through the top flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, a well thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
There is a metal lock shackle in the latch with appropriate anchor bolts on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has come up with several "fill levels": there are four anchor points, sturdily riveted, into which the locking mechanism can be screwed.
If the rucksack is full, take the top bar; if it's empty, take a deeper one.
The flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the rucksack can be closed reliably without having to use the buckle.
The second feature makes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally different from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is also a tear-off opening on both sides of the rucksack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you don't have to rummage through the contents any more!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday usability of the rucksack: If, for example, you are not only taking your photographic equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the inner space individually (more about this below), so that you can separate them from each other without any problems, and also access them independently through the two side openings.
This means you can also pull the rucksack from the right-hand side, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday essentials stay safely in the left rucksack half and don't get in the way.
Bequeme, easily adjustable carrying handles help with that.
And because the outer shell of the rucksack is completely made from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents stay dry even when heading to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commission.
Announcement by the shipping company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table.
Up until now, I have not received any news.
I beg for immediate settlement.
I now write with the third support employee, with whom I got no further than a promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It's about returning the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
So when could the cupboard be expected to be returned?
To keep him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for your help.
Wishing you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12/1/21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but nevertheless, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not have imagined and have not been able to deal with it in a timely manner and clarify it.
But as a customer I have suffered damage and I do not accept that.

Aesthetic features of our tuned glass underline the character of each car with attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing rocks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing towns in the state.
Claims were staked, tents went up, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer, seeking wealth and fame in the West.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You'll also have the chance to explore the surrounding river systems and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You have to beat your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to be more efficient, gain extra actions or turn the rules in your favour.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style by making fine adjustments.
Coloma plays out over the course of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma) to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board where they can perform an action.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a shield!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunmen.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The chaser moves to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on until the advertiser has moved five times, so that each location is covered once and the year ends.
There's a shootout where players must defend Coloma from a bandit ambush.
When players have fed enough cowboy heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they are rewarded.
However, if they fail, they receive lower bonuses or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is settled.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method of postage, packaging (games enclosed).
For everything else, usually DPD is insured and with tracking (games inserted, flies wrapped up and packaging paper).
If you are a collector, then I can send the box in a box for an additional fee of 2 euros, which is 100% sure to come to no printing plants.
Why Children Are Not Tyrants Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW emotional abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today and I watched it immediately.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids are Becoming Terrorists" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and education rights claimants are now making serious allegations against him.
Please bear with it, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other caregivers must never, never, never use their power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is appropriate and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States are advising on the abolition of the test obligation for those who have been vaccinated three times
The state health ministers want to decide at their next meeting whether to introduce a nationwide exemption from the test for people who have been vaccinated three times.
We need clarity quickly as to whether and when the test obligation can be waived for people who have been vaccinated three times, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
The withdrawal of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also delivers an additional booster effect," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will submit a proposal to the Ministerial Conference for Health next Tuesday".
Also I will send the lamp back
How should I go about this?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however I cannot see how high the seat surface is.
Can they help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG.

What you're describing will be called *awareness* so sensory perceptions under general anaesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing images, and least common is experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with a higher rate of awareness since, in order to protect the child until it is born, a very deep anaesthetic is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be discussed during the pre-anaesthetic assessment.
Specific anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **by definition did not have it.
Read her comment wrong.
However, the chair is defective.
The 20 euros are not helping us unfortunately.
Those are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to remove the broken chair.
This is not only a legal requirement, but also a standard in the eCommerce industry.
Please check again to see if you can at least take away the broken chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We are also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not replied to.
One more question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I was just there.
One man told me they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that so?
Yes, I must cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies aged 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental history of theatre.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An old man gets older".
The moving diary of a slow goodbye to the world that the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading it comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "Here I already testify to my life's thanks".
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The value of production was a good 79 million Euro.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually will not be charged

Rouladen tips and tricks
I got loads of great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
We had it at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for that :)
Well, I have tasted it and I would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, I have a large pot.
What's next?
What happened to the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I get by
IEs refers to a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed via email on 18th January that the refund had been processed.
But to this day the money has not been received by me.
Please check there.
Where to get Christmas bratwurst in the region of Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not yet ordered any poultry?
Time is running out now.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas sausage in the room of Lübeck.
The "drive" of a valve pre-amp stage plays a significant part in the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controls you can set the desired level and the clipping of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without altering the gain or the distortion.
Further up, the POWER LEVEL regulator can even be used to call up a reserve of performance if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line out.
The signal here is processed with a boxing simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
The AUX input can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favourite tunes.
A tuner is also on board - so you don't need a separate pitch pipe.
If you've also treated yourself to a VFS5 foot pedal, you can also call up the sounds conveniently using your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that was how it was with others.
Do you then have the opportunity to return the torch?
Because they are too low for over a dinner table?
So I would love to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the wardrobe?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, are they already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# seats
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a refund or voucher.
Perhaps I will find a buyer for the furniture.
Only if the goods I don't need cost more than €1,000.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to have known if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hinges.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it

Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iranian reports, progress has been made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are close to reaching an agreement on the topics to be discussed on the agenda, Iran's top negotiator Ali Bagheri told state news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is meant to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly week-long break.
Iranian, German, British, Chinese, French and Russian negotiators are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - Federal State now has the highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have exceeded 1000 cases on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had been the state with the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
The incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly on Friday and Saturday, but was still above 1000.
In Thüringen, 2,242 new cases of the Sars-CoV-2 virus were reported within a day, along with 16 additional deaths linked to an infection.
200 people who tested positive for Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There can be registration delays over the weekend.
In addition, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is not expected until early March, it may still be possible by then.
I have to print it, put it in an envelope and take it to the post office, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would be so kind as to pay for the return myself.
The 8-euro return fee is an outrage in my eyes.
It is time for change.
Greetings from the German Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post doing here?
If you look at the activities of the German Bundestag over the past few months, one thing becomes clear: they don't exist.
We've been in a winter slump and have stretched out the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
To a large extent, this is simply down to dissatisfaction with how some things have turned out and how we generally feel.
In the last few days there has been a growing sense that many here are genuinely looking forward to the CDU party conference.
#What we must change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asking who wants to keep this alive.
The backlash came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of the project and found a, shall we say, dumpster fire.
After a lot of back and forth, several members of the community have stepped forward to help rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone once again to get involved, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange information with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server by following this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How are new members to be recruited?
How do we achieve a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but it's not a big deal, we'll sort it out at the end with Discord.
If you're interested and have the time, come on Discord, work with us and let's democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/chunky for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put them together and noticed this when I took the whipped cream.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: is there a daybed #PRS_ORG# available in large sizes, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe is removed promptly.
And I beg you, make it happen now.
I don't have a suitable container, but I will do my best to disassemble the wardrobe for collection - they will need to work out how this will work with #PRS_ORG.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have time to sort this out or decide to send it back?
How do you respond to the question of why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like a lot.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and doesn't eat meat very often at the moment.
I was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism been a planned stepping stone, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that is that I thought for a long time that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that by doing so I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
So my decision to go vegan.
In that moment I had the impression that she was upset, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my response was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise that you wouldn't have otherwise.
A vegan who loves harmony greets you.
It is clear that this is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG# does not exempt them from the legal requirements for distance selling.
On the specified date, #PRS_ORG# will not pick up returns at the store.
Since I can't be there in person due to a funeral, I'm afraid that can't be changed.
Can you please assign me an alternative delivery date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue prepared: €45,000 grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant of €45,000 in the Lahnstein Town Hall to Mayor Peter Labonte for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounts to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's lord mayor Peter Labonte.
The diving vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water they carry out tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, permanent growth in turnover is expected: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following her recommendations, synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole campaign has taken me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for putting yourself out there for the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that of a bodyguard in the executive, furthermore I don't want to go into that any more!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistically posed.
In principle, one should say that of course state officials come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that people on the right of the conservative spectrum, dressed in their special uniforms and carrying weapons, should also be able to cope with the realities of life is also clear, because you have alongside the average white person, many people with migrant backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotypical queers, because there are more normal men and women in the executive who don't like to talk about it), and these people I can and must rely on, because in case of doubt they will save your life or put themselves in danger for you.
However, even these fringe groups hold conservative attitudes, according to my experience, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel disadvantaged by excessive left-wing policies, even if these policies are meant to help them, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but they are allowed to say their opinions openly or even formulate state-endangering plans openly in the media, which is totally exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course, it is not uncommon for even police officers and soldiers, who have often been on foreign deployments, to start generalizing and sometimes saying things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It is also not uncommon for right-wing sympathizers to get together and engage in lively discussions.
Nevertheless, such things are well fought against in my opinion and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationalized that it is good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black could still be delivered to Germany, or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I only see you as a partner company.
However, at the top of the wooden part, there are two deep grooves, which have been filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Orderly through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been bothered by something for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed and have little free time), but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases when nothing works, and sometimes it gets me and I pack up and clean.
But it is actually never the case that "someone could just drop by spontaneously".
My husband (unfortunately) is not any better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the budget just loses out to work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to make your children more orderly?
We haven't done one yet, but we are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me, I don't have any incentive, it just doesn't bother me, as long as there's no visitors coming and there's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen is usable.
Do men with children have a greater incentive to dress smartly or do they stay casual?
Looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have done a course in software development and have now been out of training for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, for which I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have an anxious (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
In a nutshell, I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very difficult to carry casual conversations and I have been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I have improved on).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
However, I don't know whether the actual working day is really as I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything on the internet about it.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because it brings me down every time there is something to criticise in my code ("again, just the simplest things go wrong") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I ask stupid questions at work"/"he has to hold me back a bit" etc.).
I will probably have problems in any job but I wanted to mention it.
But have you got the sofa back yet?
There was no confirmation of this.
I am waiting for a delivery date.
What do they mean by 'give back' please!
When I download a book from #PRS_ORG, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# is not authorized to download this book.
Are there any problems there?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein ingested with the feed is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into individual amino acid building blocks, which the bird then rebuilds into its own body protein, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather regeneration in the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions to the reproductive cycle.
Following this regular dose of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g Nekton-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft feed.
It is only necessary to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
An empty measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
For severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of Nekton Bio can be given at the beginning, until the new feather growth becomes visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is given until the new feather formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this e-mail?
Statement of a church worker in contradiction to the regulations
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree will be felled on our property.
Also an appeal has been made to the municipality.
An employee writes me that pruning fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the ordinance.
However, in the by-laws, the walnut is explicitly listed as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on expert opinions.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for them.
I have not received any message.
Well, then I have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Accident: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the exit of Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to a press release from the police (14:03), a car came into oncoming traffic while being overhauled.
There are casualties.
Okay, I understand.
Great, then many thanks again for making it so easy!
Rat and ideas for further career
Happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking everything it can think.
Before I dive into this now, in a nutshell: I need advice and the best from people who know my situation - that's you.
I'm doing the ref as a cross-over.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field there (for the sake of anonymity, I will not mention anything more specific).
However, the whole thing was too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching, and I was sure that's what I wanted to do - even though the conditions are a lot less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now at the third "I google other job postings" stage.
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to carry on and at least finish the ref, after which I can still change my mind.
But I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
There are holidays now, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the game I thought I was stress-resistant, but that weekend was my weekend and my celebration time was my celebration time.
That was my free time.
And the stress of work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now the family get-togethers are too stressful for me.
And then there are these stiff structures, which annoy me even more.
Fundamentally it's fun and from an outsider's perspective the ref is going well, which is good for feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to carry on like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, where I was given time off when I needed it, and where the work was tedious but I was adequately paid for it, and where I worked as part of a team, rather than as an individual like it is now most of the time.
But then I wonder if I'll be in the same place in a year's time, not happy.
You know, it's all kind of a blur, but maybe you, as an outsider, have some advice or ideas for me on how to extricate myself from this situation, in which I am completely done and basically start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not making any decisions right now, that's probably not a good thing.
But perhaps your views will help me see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me right now.
Thank you for reading and please excuse my whining tone.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a valve amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modelling engine, which is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely stunning.
These amps, of course, feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube pre-amplifier.
This partly relies on actual analogue circuits, because these get the sound variations and nuances of a valve amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which natural resonances only emerge.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and the effects sound the way you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology, which was first introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to an increase in performance for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a valve amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it was the final stage that determined the tube characteristic of the amplifier and, based on this finding, developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ power amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, forms the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a valve amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic fell 106-104 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro fastening sections, it can be adjusted to suit the needs of your photographic equipment, and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes right up to full-format reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack will depend on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible kit lens could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three additional lenses, and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or the Fuji X-T2 allow for additional lenses.
In addition, a lot of accessories can be stowed away.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that are not related to photography.
Drone pilots will also find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be the perfect choice, as it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including the remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Up until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted for 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in the past few days, but volcanologists are not yet prepared to speculate on when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Knapp 1200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, with damage estimated at over 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses, measuring around 50 hectares in total, have emerged from the coast due to the solidification of lava.
The banana industry, which is vital for the island, was particularly hard hit, with around half of the island's 85,000 population either directly or indirectly relying on it, and it was already in crisis before the volcano erupted.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with further areas severely affected, wrote newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still brings our increasingly divided society together.
It is even more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can be freed from the strict routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Technically, it was the Protestants who made Christmas so closely associated with drinking.
In the past, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were given to one or two people.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold through the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving came the popular custom in Germany of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they rejected the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ child and thereby founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, as most Protestants no longer take such detail questions so seriously, only a few are still annoyed that the custom of St. Nicholas is still as firmly entrenched in the pre-Christmas period as the Martin's custom is with Martin's singing and Martin's procession.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches by the door and under the Christmas tree - all the things your heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed to Christmas Eve.
However, in all the Christian countries there is a joyful hubbub about the question of who now brings the children presents.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some characteristics have been ascribed over time.
These include his long white beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the kamins, which he uses to gain access to people's homes.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas time.
In Spain, it is the Three Kings who bring the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch, Befana, who is supposed to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought fame to some.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses pulling a sleigh known as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, a police officer shot and killed an armed man on Saturday.
Police said the caller reported a man with a gun had entered a bank and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was subsequently stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police are not treating it as a terrorist incident.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Kate and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and high-performance 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum duration of light: 10 hours
The robust plastic casing can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood blockbusters, they are usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner colour.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun is the only thing that makes this solar lantern fascinating – either in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The borderless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the terrace, in the lawn or in the flower bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and cobbles, where he is able to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: as a solar lantern, "Smart Stone" requires neither an electrical connection nor batteries.
Place the "glow stone" in any sunny spot of your choice.
Two supplied ground pegs provide extra stability if needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides the "Smart Stone" discreetly inside it, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
As twilight falls, "Smart Stone" starts to glow of its own accord; in what colour, you decide for yourself: You have six attractive light colours to choose from – in addition to daylight white.
The switching off also happens automatically as soon as the battery charging stand has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun comes out, the charging cycle will begin again the next day.
I have done that several times and it does not work.

Pill problem
Hello lovely female people,
I hope I'm doing everything right, this is my first post on reddit after a year.
My problem: I reluctantly started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I was experiencing terrible cramps during my period and severe PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stay there because I have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last, roughly two-year break, I went from 0 to 100 and got spots everywhere.
As superficial as that, but it really upset me and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year hiatus, it never really normalized.
Maybe someone somewhere has some tips on how to avoid it this time.
Perfume-free and noise-free is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
The gynaecologist unfortunately didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the love of the skin is such a thing.
Had terrible neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread knotty eczema and the acne problem.
I have also tried every diet under the sun for my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-free diet because nothing else has worked as well.
It can also be good that hormonally the worm is simply in there, but if you, like me, have a building site everywhere, you'd rather not have to search any more for what else is going on.
I had already done everything their colleague seminars, etc.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I had to keep working and answering the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What would I have done if the money was there, I would have seen it

In the name of the people: Lay people pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear robes: Jurors, along with professional judges, determine whether someone goes to jail and for how long.

110 kV underground cable to be newly built in 2022
The approval for the laying of new high-voltage cables at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning decision paves the way for construction, which is set to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator, Bayernwerk.
The seven kilometre long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the town and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a pylon of the overhead line.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The tracking number #PRS_ORG# with the reference number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the message "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I have already explained that more than once yesterday!!
This is a glass cabinet and all the sides have collapsed, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my home and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into my home because of the #PRS_ORG# rules.
That means the wardrobe can't be collected because no one is allowed in my home
Thank you for the message.
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair is #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it's with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS_ORG, as it must be a general problem.
Reference: Lesson planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the Ref since the summer, teaching is fun, but I'm currently struggling to efficiently plan my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well-equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can only copy for free in black and white (which is annoying for geography).
I simply need a lot of time at the moment to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geographic factors, and for me, every hour is different.
In principle, the methods are always repeating themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (I need that time for UBs and so on).
In my planning, I actually always start from the learning objective (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore the work sheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
Would really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# though I would like to get rid of the return flights as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G rule for Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed.
The trade regards this as unnecessary and complains about a drop in turnover.
He also has a possible solution at the ready.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are depriving retailers of the important Christmas business.
Stefan Genth, HDE's managing director, criticised a drop in sales at shops selling non-essential items.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off their Christmas business.
What should have been the high point of the year is now often a hole without a bottom, said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food wholesale sector and online.
The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
The purchase with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
Buying 2G is not going to help us in the fight against the pandemic, he stressed.
The current rules scare customers and require a lot of staff.
The loophole must be closed nationwide, he demanded.
Afterwards, each customer will only need to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and will have access to all stores that day with the received wristband.
In addition, in retail – as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) – spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also reported a difficult Christmas.
Frequencies were last at around 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, with sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas business," said managing director Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high personal and administrative costs, centres are trying to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, under which "visitors, for example, will have to produce their 2G proof at a central point in the centre, and then, equipped with a wristband similar to those used in club hotels, will be able to enter all the shops unimpeded".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a fault, which has been attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
It looks ugly.
I would love to give the mirror back and have already put it back in the box and taped it up.
What do I do now for the return journey?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and tungsten.
It is also possible to manually set and save the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light emits a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree field of view at which you can observe large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
In addition, in situations with reporters in small rooms or short intervals.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the colour temperature.
It's a great tool to work with on set or in post-production.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the lights to be remotely controlled in television studios or if the lights are mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the torch is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glow-in-the-dark display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is a slot there for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To switch between the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply necessary to press one of the storage keys for longer, and then release it.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific colour temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, resulting from the possibility of working with low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can make use of existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the batteries before setting up, to see if they have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, there is a value shown in the two displays (the left upper display for the left battery, the right lower display for the right battery).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlights with power via the supplied network cable.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm threaded mount for attaching directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be accurately set using levelers on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and heavy use.
In addition, a swivel is included in the delivery.
What's great is that the delivery also includes a bag.
This means that you can transport or store the chandelier and all its accessories without any problems.
Sadly, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
Team we wanted to throw a party for: Frankfurt celebrate after torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen, who had not won for the last two games in a row, thought they were on the way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it around, got rid of the frustration of a poor start to the season within a good hour, and won 5:2. "It's insane what the boys have achieved today," said coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, and he gave a "general compliment to everyone who was involved".
At first glance, it looked like another dampener for the now ninth-place Frankfurt team, who are still behind expectations.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen 2:0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
How the players then came back and performed fantastically, said Glasner.
I'm absolutely delighted with the performance we've shown and the result as well.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the pitch for the first time since the fourth match and his muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
I think our mentality is unbelievable, said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus, but he also feels well set up in terms of personnel.
It's unusual that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live high-profile lives.
One wants to "continue step by step and remain humble" and complete the tasks by the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (8.30 p.m., Sky).
I received an email that my package is coming back to you because of a mistake on my end.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect it, no luck.
Can it be resent directly to me or do I have to wait for the money to be refunded and then reorder?
Unfortunately for me this means that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# seats?
Brake for handball women before quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court after their humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and their eyes empty.
To round off the World Championship main round, the DHB selection suffered a crushing 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
We were far too nervous and had too much respect for the opposition, said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was by far the worst game we've had to flush away," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement must be made against the 2019 World Championship runners-up next Tuesday in order to keep the dream of a first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was goalkeeper Alina Grijseels, who scored six goals.
We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defence, said right-back Xenia Smits, and called for: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five games, the German team was not on top form at the start of the match.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at the right temperature and prevented worse with some parries.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counter-attack.
This was not the hoped-for initial spark, however.
Against the aggressive marking of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they usually failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The match ended 3:10 after 20 minutes, with goalkeeper Mia Zschocke seeing red for a hard foul on her opponent just a few minutes later.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to play again.
It wasn't until the final stages of the first half that the DHB team started to come into the game, and by the break at least they had managed five goals.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greens' proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for their well-prepared opponent, who is a candidate for a medal at the final.
As a result, the German team could no longer muster an improvement in performance and went out as clear losers.

Does that work for them?
The title exists, I work as an infectious disease specialist in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, among others, is being administered in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it goes on to the vaccination centres for me.
I enjoy answering questions on organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, without a time limit, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccine?").
Tasks within my area of work include clarifying vaccination, determining indications (person has a right to vaccination according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In pharmaceutical companies, however, we often do not have pharmacy technicians there, but "only" pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of vaccines, who, however, cannot administer injections (can they?), so I have to do most of the injections myself there.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, there was plenty of food for thought in the Bavarian regional television programme "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host me?" was left unanswered by callers in the series.
No, it wasn't "some guy who's nervous".
And also nobody, "who has to do everything quickly".
That, according to the TV presenter, is completely untrue.
This is what the man from Amberg had to say about the solution, and thereby probably caused surprise among many Upper Palatinate people.
Der Huidlerer, viewers were told, "is a rag used to clean the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed that.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate concept, derived in some way from the better-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for many who have lived in Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After the confirmation, the following error message is displayed: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# up and running, newly started, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Tyre choice for racing bikes - really that reliable?
This morning, I woke up with a sense of urgency because I wanted to train at least a little for my upcoming bike tour next week.
Said, done and off I went on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful – but then that happened, which lurks in every city centre (thank you, Krefeld!).
Shards of glass on the line.
Zack, squeaky brakes and my rear tyre definitely didn't want to do any more of the journey.
As I had no realistic chance of getting a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to make do with half-heartedly turning around and taking the first train home.
War would also be less of a nuisance, perhaps it is even better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike trip.
However, I now face a question and hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would hate to get this problem again and again.
It wasn't really bad now, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bicycle until 2pm) had also described as suboptimal because he had ridden them for years on the road.
However, if I think about having to change my tires after driving 80-90km, then I'm really in a bad mood:D
Now I was talking to an older man at the platform and he asked me why I didn't have the marathon plus tyres; these are supposed to be indestructible.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I have little desire now to spend €40 on a tire, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: at the moment I believe I have 25 x 622 on the bicycle.
They do (apparently?) exist for the marathon plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend a different brand of bicycle tire to me?
The swallow page seems to be my absolute! Rather recommend the Durano DD to you?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!

Following the publication of our new high-end broadband cable B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series started to produce offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring, and it looks like the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this building proposal, a suitably designed foot is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the conditions at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum volume is less of a priority, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate near-unfiltered such high sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she is remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal was the SOLO 15 with a slight high-end lift.
This is common practice with broadband connections to optimise the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is aimed directly at the listening position and convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The treble range can be slightly turned towards the outside to reduce the treble range and thus warm up the sound.
Thanks to the directional sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is measurably sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure that it has the same enemy.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it's a good idea to think about the final cosmetic appearance of the speakers at the outset, so that any necessary changes can be incorporated into the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the case, the drop in the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the boards have been cut to size (e.g. in the DIY store), the first thing to do is to drill a 8mm hole in the floor board in the appropriate place, so that the cables can be fed through there later without any problems.
With the help of an overhead crane, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
The opening on the back should be rounded off with a 45° phase so as to make the opening of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
Afterwards, you begin with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
These are now glued onto the back, lid, front and base.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued in.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example, if you want to use pre-cut plywood from the DIY store instead of making your own from 16mm MDF.
In the next working step, the second page will be added.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front, follow.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill, the installation of the bass reflex port openings, as well as the mounting clip on the back, can be facilitated.
Finally, a round sander is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper surface of the sole plate can also be rounded off using this method.
The bottom plate is then glued firmly to the bottom of the case, and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
Next, mark and drill (2.5mm drill) the fixing points for the speaker chassis and the connector.
Once the casing has been cleaned of wood dust (absorb / blow out), you can begin to move the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
To do this, the entire and uncut cable is fed through the 8mm hole in the foot, one section at a time, until it reaches the terminal opening, and is left hanging out about 30 cm.
At the top of the case, lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang loosely there as well.
The frequency changer will then be prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding continuation plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation manual Weiche Solo 15.
Once the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Using the 35mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of skill, you can pour hot glue into the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small torch you can check the seal accordingly.
According to the description, now follows the damping.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be connected to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
The bass reflex tube is then cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen vibrations, a mat of damping material is cut in two and loosely inserted into the housing.
The bass reflex port should be left open.
Can I cancel an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone.
We are finally able to announce that we will once again be organizing the OSCAST this year!
Due to well-known reasons, unfortunately it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher level of planning and the reason for the short notice of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we'll be doing the Oscars 2021 with at least seven streams and hopefully thousands of you watching!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 00:30.
Stock up on drinks, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
