The students of Zhejiang University played the lead role in the学术 conference, and the research results caused a lot of imagination and excitement. (Source：新华网)
wash your hands with air, breath a prayer to tell if you have a disease, and accurately search for the source of pm2.5 yesterday evening at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Festival of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant academic achievements were rewarded.
The main研究者 of these achievements are students, covering major fields such as environmental, machinery, energy, healthcare, life science, and humanities education. Students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have been awarded domestically and internationally.
Biosensor: Your Home Health Guard
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the Medical Biology College, demonstrated a biological sensor attached to a smartphone端， which was only half the size of a智能手机.
"你只需要轻轻吸一口气，这套仪器就能从你呼出的气体成分中，初步检测你的身体健康状况."
Zhang Di Ming said that the sensors are connected to smartphones, and once a person takes a breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart手环 available on the market can detect health conditions by mainly measuring physical parameters such as temperature and heart rate.
This set of bioelectronic sensors employs a novel material called石墨烯， which targets化学元素. Its keen "嗅觉" enables it to detect health conditions more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lamps: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart手术 lights are also being used in medical手术室.
This invention won a prize at the 44th International patent Fair in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The postgraduate student from the Photovoltaic Science and Engineering College, Zhu Lin靖 and Shuang Shuangshin-Fen, opened a new perspective by solving the defects of traditional手术 lights and发明了 intelligent LED手术 cloaking lights.
Many diseases fail to be detected in the early stages and executed properly, which is related to the lights used in doctors' operating rooms.
She said, for example, when performing early cancer screening, if doctors are not able to see all tumor tissues in time，癌细胞 may continue to spread after that.
This smart surgical light has four light panels that can enhance the difference between different tissues under light exposure by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgical procedures, doctors can adjust the size, brightness，光谱， color均匀性， and shadows of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the surgical procedure and their personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested and received good feedback at hospitals such as浙江大学医学院附属邵逸夫医院 and浙江大学医学院附属儿童医院.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the national challenge cup.
洗手用空气： save water and be酷炫.
Most people洗手 involves simply brushing their teeth with water, perhaps brushing off a bit of soap, and pressing a洗手液 button. Friends like Li Qiqi and their colleagues have invented a set of "air-dry洗手 devices."
Only by standing on the equipped洗手台 will our weight compress the air.
It's like a tire iron.
The air that is compressed forms a liquid at the water tap, merging with the water.
So, we can wash our hands properly!
The color reaction and bacteria persistence experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of washing hands with this method is the same as that of regular hand washing methods.
This device requires only重力 as a driving force, ensuring a clean level while also saving 90% of the water. The entire process is entirely energy-efficient and sustainable.
Last year, at the second Global Forum on major Challenge, this invention emerged victorious among numerous world top universities and won the only golden award.
Please arrange for me to have the missing item back as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, without points, and will not use it again in the future #PRS_ORG#!
骨头和辣泡菜 are not suitable for children's food.
If it's true, please order as soon as possible.
"暂时没有，谢谢"
He called me and told me to tell you where he is. #PRS_ORG#
I'm not waiting anymore, please cancel the order.
I bought #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the address wrong.
Can you modify it?
"Or cancel your order."
Sure, thank you very much.
One certificate that comes to mind is very meaningful - emergency medical certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates that I feel is more important than a driver's license!
Enlighten everyone: emergency measures are mainly used for emergency response during sudden events, such as rescue before a car arrives.
As is widely known, there is a period of time during which the救护车 arrives after the accident, and this is actually the most crucial period.
This is the time when you need emergency medical assistance.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, and sudden respiratory failure, then our window of life only has four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important that close people have knowledge of first aid!
When someone falls around us, we can use our professional knowledge to try to save them, rather than simply standing there doing nothing. The feeling of helplessness is too可怕.
In China, according to official data, there are over three million accidents annually, and the最危险的 is sudden cardiac death.
In the United States, on average, 15% of the population can be saved.
In Las Vegas赌场酒店， about 80% to 90% of guests can recover, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is what First反应 founder Lu乐 said.
If someone experiences a heart attack, their breathing is stopped, and their heart is no longer beating, holding their breath or striking their人中 will do nothing.
There is only a possibility of saving someone's life through artificial respiration and chest compressions if they are in critical condition.
I find that very few people have this awareness to learn emergency basic care. When it happens, it's too late. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can react appropriately in sudden situations.
It's possible that this could also save a life!
A first aid certificate can be registered for your local Red Cross training center. I registered for the training center in portugal, and students have a discount.
PS: The last picture is recording the goals that I want to achieve before I turn 25. Adding the emergency medical technician's certification to my goal list was also a few months ago, but I did it!
I am going to take on other certifications I have been wanting to pursue. I plan to obtain a diving certification, and I found out about a diving emergency certification on Xiaohongshu. To obtain this certification, you need to have an emergency response certification first, so it is still very useful.
I have ordered ##NUMBER#.
Among them, just one虾饺 at 13 yuan!?
I've not tried it.
How can #NAME# be not clear?
Is it $13?
Last night, #PRS_ORG# left some delivered food behind, so this time, just give me one chicken虾仁饺 to eat!?
Because I saw that the code I entered before was有效.
Let's start with the conclusion: In my personal opinion, "The Four Seasons" is a complete and total disaster, from all aspects and perspectives.
However, if you say that this movie is not a highlight either, that is not necessarily true, at least the soundtrack choice is quite good.
Good movies come in many forms, including the ones that make you fall asleep in the movie theater, and the ones that leave you feeling angry after watching them. "The Great Gatsby" is like a monkey on Mount Fuji for viewers, able to有无数种方式点燃你的怒火.
In terms of mocking the audience，韩寒 is truly exceptional.
What makes this film most painful is that it seems like a creation from a class novel, difficult to describe, with gaps that are like the jacket of Master哥's coat.
Even after watching it, you might be confused about whether there are any hidden隐喻s in the film, but after careful consideration, you realize that it's actually just a load of排泄物.
Let me give you a brief overview of some情节 that I am really difficult to understand.
The male protagonist's居住地 should be a small island in the south, where he lives with his grandmother by his side.
Her grandmother had an愿望 to see snow, and then the story arranges for one of her neighbors to drive her small pickup truck to take her to the North to see snow.
elderly people sit in a private car from the south to the north to see snow?
He and his father are still very confident about this.
Then this old man stopped there.
How did the女主's brother obtain a business registration certificate for opening a hotel on a abandoned ship?
Why did the island's biker gang teenagers easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel stops by the side of the road, and the driver can't find the truck anywhere in the surrounding area.
This equipment feeling is too obvious.
Why would a small-time troublemaker with criminal suspect statuses become a part of the private security force?
When faced with high-interest loans, why don't people call the police? In the movie, the警察 even asked if there were any difficulties.
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use房卡 to open the hotel room door. Then, they强行 schedule themselves without the hotel owner's permission to sit outside the room for a night?
This absurd plot is prevalent throughout the entire film, so much so that when I recall them, it causes me pain.
In addition to the plot, what's even worse is the film's theme, or perhaps there isn't any theme at all; it's just a sinister concoction of characters who are trying to merge and reconcile.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy film. After 20多 minutes, you猜 it might be a励志 film. When you were half-way through the movie, you thought it might be a drama film showing the difficulties of young people in a small town. After you finished the movie, you didn't even know what you had just watched, and then there was a deep questioning of yourself, why would you go to the cinema to watch such a thing as大便？
For the majority of people, they are also quite familiar with the template of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about摩托车手， you can turn it into a励志-喜剧 film that tells audiences how an talented beginner gradually reaches the success.
If you want to make a romantic film, you should simply tell the story of a cute little town boy who loves riding a bike and a server girl who has a complicated history with him.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your narrative cannot contain things that are inconsistent with the normal world.
It's not appropriate to have thoughts or ideas that are so imaginative and的想象力 that even John F. Kennedy would be unable to handle.
Considering that the female protagonist is not弱智， but she behaves like a 5-year-old child in certain aspects, I don't know whether it's due to her acting or the导演's requirements.
Another thing I'm not clear about is why韩寒， as a赛车手， is so interested in adding crash scenes to his movies.
Is it not to create a strain on viewers?

Introduction of the inspection井 concrete block module production and processing equipment in Zhengzhou:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection井模块砖机， inspection井砌块机械， and井壁墙体模块机械. We have a range of production lines from semi-automatic to fully automatic.
Through years of practice and development, we have now achieved high quality, and our main products are hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated inspection well series equipment and associated devices.
Check井 concrete block module production and assembly equipment, Zhengzhou block wall concrete module equipment assembly site:
The characteristics and advantages of the Zhengzhou underground mine wall coal block module production equipment:
The grouting bricks machine of Yi欣检查井 is widely applicable to new grouting materials such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas for municipal underground construction structures.
例如：各类检查井，雨水口，方沟，污水处理池，小型建筑物，桥梁翼墙等。
The advantage of constructing underground inspection hooks using concrete blocks is that the blocks are all flat and have deep and shallow槽 structures on all four sides, which can be combined and built into a chain.
The剪力 of the vertical wall of the well is far better than the construction form of the flat friction brick.
The module is a中空 structure, and after组合ing and砖混ing, the vertical holes are interconnected and the horizontal holes are贯串ed. After the core of the hole is filled with concrete, a woven concrete network is formed, which serves as a second strengthening and waterproofing effect.
Themodules have both horizontal and vertical slots for reinforcement, which correspond to a corresponding increase in the overall strength of the structure.
In addition，检查井 and drainage井 built with concrete检查井模块 are less likely to collapse, fall, or leak. The mechanical properties of the wall modules on the井壁 are stable, easy to operate, and meet standard成形 dimensions.
The concrete inspection hole module of block machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control and data input/output devices. A single key input and output is available, and a touch-screen liquid crystal display monitors the entire mechanical operation process, achieving an ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of bed material, density operation, safety logic control, and fault诊断 system.
The mechanical液压系统 for the井下壁墙 module consists of a single-cylinder hydraulic system for loading and unloading, and a double-cylinder hydraulic system for loading and unloading.
An independent fluidic integrated unit avoids the effects of the mainboard vibration on the fluidic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the fluidic system.
The concrete inspection井 block砖机 equipment conveys the fabric bag while the template box rises, the storage box door关闭， automatic delivery platform, all独立完成 by液压系统， achieving the reduction of mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well block machine equipment uses imported computers, electrical components, seals, and hydraulic components, ensuring that the overall performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform for the wall module of the well is made of complete plate steel. The platform is线切割合模， without any weld points, allowing the fill material box to freely move and guide, fully reducing the mechanical wear.
To reduce the模具 load, add material, and encrypt the amplitude in a single unit, adopting monolithic and full synchronization，心悸、模振， and ensure the actual effect.
The drilling wall module machine has a mechanical vibration device, and computer automation control the amplitude based on the cost-effectiveness of raw materials. The amplitude is adjusted without磨损， thus extending the service life and reducing the cost.
The well wall panel module has both mechanical automation and manual control with双重 functions.

重庆中等职业技术学校启动现代学徒制试点 学生入学即被视为企业准员工-新华网
Last night, I was informed by the city's education office that from this year starting, our city will pilot the "现代学徒制" talent cultivation model for 60 secondary vocational schools. Students participating in the pilot program will also hold the apprentice status, and will be pre-录d as employee members after enrollment.
The City University requires to regulate the enrollment and hiring processes of third-level secondary schools, and clarify the双重身份 of apprentices as third-level secondary school students and potential employees of the enterprise. According to the principle of mutual choice, apprentices, schools, and the enterprise must sign a三方 agreement. For apprentices who are 16 years old or older but not 18 years old, the agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise. The agreement should determine the rights and interests of all parties, as well as specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for apprentices in employment training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship form to jointly carry out employee pre-job training and transfer training with collaborating enterprises.
pilot schools need to reform the cultivation education model.
The institution and the enterprise jointly design talent development programs, jointly establish professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot period is以培养 the curriculum as a pilot cycle. Students'实习时间 in the company is determined according to the professional人才培养 program, and the top-level实习 is usually about 6 months.
In corporate practice, a corporate team-based management model should be implemented. Depending on the characteristics of each professional, one mentor can lead 2 to 5 students, forming a learning team to ensure that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 pilot projects for modern master's and bachelor's degree programs in public intermediate-level schools, with a total number of about 3,000 students ( apprentices) in three batches.
According to the principle of piloting before implementation and gradually expanding from point to point, we will experiment with joint admissions, joint training, and integrated teaching programs to enhance students' job skills and improve their relevant employment employability and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Amlo直射力虽强 but it is mainly associated with mild symptoms.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus are less severe than those caused by the Delta variant, although the spread is faster.
According to媒报道，With the spread of theAMC variety in South Africa,A group of over 5000 doctors from the province of Haringey reported that the symptoms of新冠 patients currently being treated are relatively mild, such as headaches and coughs, which are similar to those of流感.
The doctor, Unben Pillay, as the director of the organization, said that he sees several hundred patients a day, but there are still no patients requiring hospitalization.
Pi莱 said: "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who were generally more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infections.
He says that compared to this, during the Del塔 (Tanzania)疫情 of the previous wave, the patients he treated for COVID-19 experienced "air hunger and low blood氧饱和度."
Many people will be hospitalized within days.
Two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in南部非洲， other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will still take several weeks to collect enough data，医生的观察 and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the南非National Institute of传染病 Research, in recent weeks, only 30% of COVID-19 patients requiring hospital treatment are severe, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to a death rate of 20% in early cases in南非.
The Director-General of the African Health Institute，威廉·哈内姆 (Willem Hanekom)，引用了国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告，说：“At present, all signs suggest that this is a relatively mild disease.”
He also said, "It's still early, we need to obtain later data."
In general, the time when住院 and death occur is later, and we entered this wave of epidemics only for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospital admissions, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the most prominent strain of the COVID-19 virus worldwide，密克戎病例 are emerging in数十 countries, with南非 being the hub of the pandemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the Hashemitemite Kingdom of Jordan in the first week of December increased by 400%. Testing showed that cases of Omicron variant hold over 90% coverage.

Education News: What's the Solution to Saving Captured Children?
If we compare the famous public service campaign phrase "No purchase, no杀害" to this, then in a good environment without "repression" demand for拐卖 cases, community-based prevention and resistance against拐卖， enable拐卖行为 to be profitable, risky, and costly, and thus prevent such crimes from happening repeatedly.
Recently, the public safety department's anti-拐卖办 developed an emergency application platform for the release of information on children's disappearances.
This is an internet platform created to establish a credible channel for the publication of child disappearance information and to facilitate the timely recovery of abduction children.
Upon hearing the name "Unity" of this app, I felt a warmth in my heart.
New technological methods not only have a name that is "文艺" and full of passion, but they also effectively utilize information technology, being practical and effective.
The primary goal of拐卖执法 is to locate and recover拐卖ed children and protect their physical safety and freedom.
Next to the trial and punishment of嫌疑人s, this is the order.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed很长很长列表， from individual punishment, social prevention, to legal education.
但在拐卖案件告破之前，应优先关注被害人的人身安全。  However, before the trafficking cases are solved, it is necessary to prioritize the safety of the victims.
Matters have different importance and urgency, and under the immediate and pressing objective of " finding" help, topics such as "should child trafficking be punished with the death penalty all together?", which have various opinions and strong争议， can be temporarily put aside for cautious discussion; but helping those affected by child trafficking cannot be prioritized.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickingrs are often willing to leave the crime scene as soon as they catch the attention of law enforcement.
If the找回走失孩子 operation takes a minute more, the child may be one step closer to their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will also increase by one point.
In this case, coming up with effective measures such as the "Unity" platform that directly help to solve crimes and locate children is indeed a practical move.
After all, "challenging拐卖人口" requires working through the entire legal system to be a major task.
In order to combat crime and protect children and parents' rights, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, and from the meticulous enforcement of law to the implementation of the concern for " protecting the young and supporting the weak," there is no need for anything to be done except to promote the spirit of " protecting the young and supporting the weak."
In addition, the prevention of human trafficking, from the family to society, can still be better.
For example, a common case is that a family is resting at the火车站， and the parents are asleep, only to find out when they wake up that their child has gone missing.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-defense skills, but as the parent of a young child, at least you should have a certain level of protection awareness.
The basic measure to prevent children from being stolen is for parents to alternate rest and or place their children in safe protection.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, the side that purchases the stolen child should also be paid attention to and punished.
Each individual illegal act often serves as just one link in a long chain of criminal activity.
According to the Chinese criminal law, the法定刑 for the crime of trafficking children is 5 years; in more serious cases, it can reach the death penalty and property没收.
With a high死刑 threshold and a severe maximum penalty, under the broader trend of "lighting up" the criminal justice system, the crime of trafficking in children clearly falls within a category of more serious crimes for which greater punishment is necessary.
Despite this, there are still many cases of trafficking that occur each year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas about parenting and have weak的法律 awareness.
The legal education of this这部分 people should be synchronized and follow-up.
In order to effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not sufficient to rely only on official strict enforcement.
If there is a widely-used "market" for buying and selling victims of绑架， the绑架ers become motivated by greed and constantly innovate in ways to control and manipulate the victims, creating a "war" with law enforcement officials. Therefore, the rescue operation will inevitably fall into an inefficient trap.
Therefore, breaking down outdated beliefs and promoting legal knowledge also helps to eliminate the crime of transporting and purchasing children.

Actually, it's not clear whether it's the store's mistake or the driver's mistake.
There are no documents on the package.
There is something that cannot be tracked.
"希望你们了解一下"
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than the displayed time.
There's nothing else. Thank you.
Yes, we have replaced one rider.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, and provides five levels of classification for each.
Early-extracted olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained directly from fresh olive fruits through mechanical cold-pressing, after removing any异物 through过滤等处理.
There can be three different levels based on the acidity.
特级初榨橄榄油(Extra Virgin): is the highest level and highest quality橄榄油， it is a natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a light and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not over 1%.
High-quality raw olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly acidic, but no more than 2%, with a pure and aromatic flavor.
Ordinary Virgin橄榄油： The taste and flavor are nice, with a pH level no higher than 3.3%.
Recalls橄榄油 refers to refined crude橄榄油 that has an API gravity higher than 33%, or become "二次油" after refining.
精炼橄榄油 can be divided into two levels:
Normal olive oil: refined olive oil is mixed with a一定比例 of fresh olive oil to standardize its flavor and color. The acidity is below 1.5%, and it comes in a clear, pale golden color.
Refined Olive Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: obtained from the waste oil渣 by solvent extraction and further refining of橄榄油.
You should have discovered by now that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
要知道，橄榄果 like the grapes used to make wine, produce橄榄油 with varying standards depending on the region and variety of olives.
The best place for olive trees to grow:
The Mediterranean coast has the ideal soil and climate conditions for olive grove growth, including temperature, sunshine, humidity, and precipitation.
In addition to the地中海沿岸， other regions can only grow零星ly in suitable areas.
Main production area/ Location ( Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco，叙利亚，以色列， Tunesy, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan，黎巴嫩， and many others, such as Argentina，秘鲁， South Africa, and South America, which have similar climates.
油橄榄的采摘月份：
During the months of March to June each year，橄榄树 blooms and generates fruit. From July to October, the fruits start growing and mature, gradually transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally turning black.
The months from November to February are the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in单不饱和脂肪酸， such as 亚油酸 and亚麻酸， as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the best oil for human nutrition among all the cooking oils discovered so far.
The democratic峰会 has ended, Biden claims that the flame of freedom will never fade away.
The virtual "Summit for Democracy" organized by President Joe Biden of the United States, as well as leaders from 110 countries worldwide, including governments and civil society, ended on Friday ( December 10th).
Biden said in his closing statement that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of every person on Earth, and that the独裁政权 will never be able to extinguish it.
He also expressed that he plans to hold the second global " democractic summit" next year.
The representatives of the Taiwan government, the vice premier, and Run Guangqiu, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist currently living in英国， spoke at the next day's summit.
Biden said, "We know the work that lies before us is how艰巨."
But we also know that we can face challenges, because as I previously mentioned, as demonstrated by this峰会， the democratic world is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime will never熄灭 the small flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere.
Biden also said that protecting民主 requires a collective effort from整个社会.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to hear our citizens, strengthen the firewall of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and more effectively抵御 the buffer and impact of authoritarian forces, as well as those who seek to pursue power openly before公共利益."
The topics for the second day of the democratic峰会 were to捍卫 human rights, consolidate democracy, resist authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirmation of democratic values.
This day is also known as the "International Day of Human Rights".
In his opening speech on that day, Secretary General Guterres also expressed that the struggle for democracy worldwide faces challenges, particularly from emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reiterate our common values and positions, as well as the resilience of民主.
This requires deepening social dialogue, resolving issues of inequality, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires strongly谴责 all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremistism, including利用 all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Lu Guangcon, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist, gave a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to monitor the human rights situation of Hong Kong, as well as other Chinese ethnic groups such as the维吾尔族 and Tibetans.
He says: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable."
That's why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all that we have to ensure that the revitalization of democracy is our top priority.
Luo Guang聪 also called for the freedom world to unite to face the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid to anger Comrade Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose China's market, and maybe some of you are not aware of the threat to our democratic values posed by the Communist Party of China.
And this is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.
During the roundtable discussion on " against digital authoritarianism, celebrate民主 values", Tang Fen, Minister of Public works of Taiwan, released a national statement through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of对抗专制 and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
He said: "At the beginning of the rapid growth of台湾的民主， we have always remained steadfast on the front line of global对抗 authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world合理化侵犯 human rights acts under the name of public health and collective interests, showing a trend of倒退 in global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't need to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't need to remove the product from the market to defeat fake information.
Just during the second day of the "Democracy峰会，" the US Treasury announced依法制裁 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries被认定为严重侵犯人权， as well as implementing investment restrictions on a Chinese company被认定为 using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know, right?
However, the restaurant has been repeatedly delaying the delivery time without any reason.
" 原来要 #NUMBER#"
"那总之我不叫了"  translates to "Therefore, I will no longer call you."
I don't want to eat anymore.
"I will definitely file a complaint."
You can't send it, why didn't you tell me earlier?
You've been waiting for me for so long.
No, I haven't received the call.
Please let him know to deliver it to our company again.
I don't want to wait any more #NUMBER# minutes.
I have been waiting for an hour for this meal.
All #PRS_ORG# have not been sent.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the curry chicken that the restaurant sent over is raw.
I would like to try playing tennis, but I am afraid I won't be able to keep up, so I think I would like to practice with a price that's about right before trying to become a pro.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the friendly level. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheaper ones, and these "beginner lenses" are actually industrial垃圾.
They have very low strength, and when the ball lands on the拍， there is a very large vibration, and hard balls cannot withstand them. It is very difficult for experts to control.
The logic and undertone of their existence are——网球这么难， knowing that you cannot learn it and also that you are not willing to buy expensive ones, I will give you a cheap one to play with. You will play twice and then never play again, so this发球器 is cheap and you won't mind.
When you really can distinguish good from bad, it means you have improved. Then come to me again when you buy the expensive item, and I'll make two money.
It's recommended to spend similar money on a used but good羽毛球拍. Choose prince or d和组织， these brands are not so popular, so good羽毛球拍s will not sell for a good price. New拍s are around 500-600, and used ones can be 200. Having the pleasure of using a 1000-level拍 isn't that worth it?
The new user is quite friendly, but once they pass the beginner stage, it becomes "鸡肋". However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The delivery date of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Could you please help me keep in touch with this matter?
推迟
Thank you.
Could you please clarify what you mean by "就是说，其实我已经有 credit 了？"?
Next, do I need to rebuy everything? And is the original order no longer necessary?
Hello, I ordered the food from this restaurant, but the products that were delivered were missing a lot, and the server also brought me a raw口水鸡.
The English translation for the sentence "#PRS_ORG# 无缘无故说要我自取，麻烦请取消" is "Why on earth did #PRS_ORG# request that I retrieve it by myself? Please please cancel it."
The order I placed requires delivery, completely disregarding the idea of self-delivery.
Jiangxi will train 100,000 teachers in rural primary schools in three years -新华网
This sentence can be translated into English as follows:  On May 22, 2022, the Chinese People's Daily reported that recent reports from the江西省教育厅 have revealed that in order to strengthen the保障能力 of the教师队伍 in key fields and achieve the comprehensive and均衡发展 of rural义务教育， the江西省 has planned to train qualified teachers in music, arts, and sports at each primary school in the entire region (downtown and beneath) for a total of 100,000 teachers over a three-year period starting from 2016.
According to my understanding, this training targets teachers in rural schools throughout Jiangxi who are aged 45 or younger and have a knowledge base or talent in music, art, and sports. They can also teach other subjects while working on music, art, and sports courses.
Through training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of music, sports, and cultural education subjects. They will update their teaching ideas and concepts and master modern teaching methods. They will improve their subject teaching skills, activities design skills, cultural校园文化能力， and self-development skills. They will create a multi-functional music, sports, and cultural education教师队伍 to alleviate the problem of shortages of rural music, sports, and cultural education teachers.
In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of training, Jiangxi is also planning to train 100 schools in 100 districts ( municipalities and neighborhoods) of all over the province, including music, art, and sports, a total of 300 trainers. This will全面提升 their teaching and示范引领能力， organizational ability for classroom activities, training ability, and construction ability for online training workshops, serving as teaching，示范， guidance, and supervision.
Because waiting for 20 minutes more would already be 1 hour and 10 minutes.
I don't want the food that was prepared 1 hour ago.
I have found the buyer of the previous mistake order.
But my车轮饼 is missing.

Hello, how long will the meal be delivered?
"The people have finished work."
Your biker's phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, and his name is #NAME#.
Could you give me a reasonable explanation?
Yes, but your driver is very bad. Please take care of it properly.
Could you check to see if it's still on the way? If it is, it would be best to deliver it right away.
OK, if really there's no, give back the meal plan money.
In reality, there is a lot of讲究 regarding the clothing搭配 for women who have a slightly muscular body.
The dress that a girl with胖身体 should wear should not be too short or too long, it should be about the same length as the knees and just enough to cover the area where the thigh is thick.
If the skirt is too short, the thickness of your legs will be visible.
The sentence in Chinese is: 过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。  The English translation for this sentence is: If a person's height is excessive, it can give the impression of being矮 and fatty.
If you divide your outfit into three sections and differentiate them by different colors, it will look like you are naturally towering. This is because you will have an elegant and towering effect with your tops, dresses, and long stockings.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a standard配备 for微胖 girls (which the author is particularly familiar with). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and a elegant black short skirt is also a first choice for微胖 girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially a short black skirt, will make you look smaller.
If your小腿 is very fatty, don't wear your socks and shoes too much attention-grabbing.
The more popular the message is, the better. The colors should not be too vivid.
Avoid giving the impression of being overweight when people are focusing on your legs and feet.
Always be aware of the tips for good clothing arrangement for girls who are slightly slightly overweight.
It is never recommended for slightly overweight girls to wear紧身的短裙， as it can be uncomfortable to the eyes. If your legs are粗， you should wear black thigh-high socks or legging袜子 (with small格子 patterns), choose a soft and colorful 喇叭裤 (thigh裤) with a loose-fitting top, and pair it with a top with a领子 that comes up and covers your shoulders, which will be able to effectively hide the shortcomings of overweight girls.
Of course, when it comes to wearing short dresses, there are also many details for slightly overweight girls.
When wearing a short skirt, it's better to choose a上衣 with the same color as the skirt, so as to have an effect of increasing height for your丰润多汁的身材.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look even more elegant, which is definitely the most popular style in summer!
If you are a woman who has a slightly muscular upper body but is very thin in the legs, I recommend choosing a spacious and elegant piece of连衣短裙.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also highlight your strengths.
An A-line short skirt will help you look slimmer, especially if you're a heavier girl. Choose a tight-fitting top to create depth and make you look slimmer.
Simply wear a white T-shirt with a short skirt, and even fat girls can try it.
A slightly overweight girl can also wear fashion sense.
As long as women can master the principles of clothing搭配， they will also be the focus of attention.
After making changes to our clothing搭配， we should also exercise more in life. We want to break the tag of "frail and overweight woman" as soon as possible 😄

The girl became a target for arrows to raise funds for her sister: "It's only a bit uncomfortable to think about it, but considering it's just physical injuries, it's not too bad." -新华网
A girl is standing before a large木板 in Hangzhou West Lake Square, where the木板 has the words "Human target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
Last morning, a photo of a "杭州女孩 willing to be a 'target' to raise money for my sister" spread through my social media feed.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large board that is slightly higher than a human being, with the words "Human靶子， 10 yuan per arrow" written on it. It indicates that anyone who pays the fee can use arrows to射击 on the board.
This action has sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity manager of the West Lake District Bureau of the Hangzhou City公安 Department confirmed to the Journal that the police confirmed that the girl made such过激 actions for her sister's fundraising, but this behavior is not recommended. After being warned, the girl has already left the local police station yesterday.
The girl collected money as a "target" on the street and was reminded to be mindful of the need to donate.
In the widely shared image, a long-haired girl is standing in front of a large piece of wood with the words "Human target, 10 yuan one arrow" written in black ink on the wood. On the other side of her, another piece of wood with her bank account number, WeChat, Alipay, and other accounts written in English.
The image of this matter caused controversy after it was uploaded to the internet.
Some netizens consider this act as "博眼球的乞讨行为" and some also express同情 towards it.
We discovered this situation when we were巡逻ing by the square around 10 a.m. on February 23rd, and there were already a number of people围观.
A local journalist from Qinsha, China, during a local media interview, said that there were two girls selling things near the scene of the incident, both around 20 years old, dressed in fresh and beautiful clothing.
Among them, the girl who played as a "human target" was continuously crying and asking strangers to play the game; another girl was nearby helping to advertise, saying that her friend's的姐姐 was diagnosed with leukemia and needed a surgery fee now, and everyone should help her.
"We reached out to the local police in Qinghai and learned that this girl is collecting funds for her sister's cancer treatment."
Last night, the public information officer of Hangzhou Police Sub-station West Liucheng told新京报记者 that this girl's name is Ji Jiali, and she is collecting donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, due to the still requiring over 30,000 cost for treatment, one couldn't come up with a good fundraising idea at the moment, and thus made such a gesture.
He said that during the entire process, two girls were assigned as targets and one was responsible for assisting, but they did not take part in the activity. No one射箭 during the entire process, only some viewers watched and took pictures on Twitter.
After the police conducted an analysis by the security department, the arrows used were not within the control scope.
The负责人表示，“不提倡采取这种博眼球募捐方式” 。
After being告诫 by the police officer's department, she has already left the police station.

What was the most popular in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the World Cup Village Summer奥运会.
Do you think only athletes from the Olympic Games can win prizes?
In the past few months, a的文章 called "Looking forward：奥运项目 for project managers to challenge金牌" has been popular. It says that project managers in many areas can go head-to-head with no equals: pushing buttons, traveling, and working late are their daily routine, and dealing with leaks，背锅， and apologies is no exception.
The seemingly light-hearted and humorous article reveals the daily difficulties of project managers, which背后 represent their inability to effectively manage the current project work.
Meanwhile, those engaged in project management have also begun to choose to摆脱 their working dilemmas through some actions.
From the annual increase in PMP (International Certified Professional in Project Management) application numbers, it can be seen that an increasingly number of project management professionals are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "20 Years of Development of Project Management in China (1999-2019)" report, up to September 2019, the total number of PMP® registrations nationwide was approximately 60,000,000, with approximately 4.2 million passing the PMP® certification, and approximately 3 million valid registered individuals worldwide. This represents 31.2% of the total worldwide PMP® certification volume.
The number of PMP certification holders has been increasing over the past 10 years, indicating that more and more project managers are recognizing that simple adherence to past "old wisdom" is no longer feasible. The constantly changing work environment teaches us that one must learn to step into the shoes of scientific giants as we explore the path ahead.
However, having a PMP certification can ensure that project management work is un禁忌地开展吗？
Many beginning project management professionals indicate that by studying PMP/IPMP-related courses, they can acquire a systematic understanding of the ten major areas and the five process groups related to project management. However, it is still a huge issue when they actually carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback on the following issues:   - Lack of understanding and application of project management, relying solely on personal experience, with empty project management theories, and不知道如何实践；  -缺乏系统的project management process and制度支持， unable to implement the project in practice, project estimation errors, poor control灵敏度， and the project is delayed;  - unclear member roles and team "old 油条" not knowing how to handle;  - Cross-departmental协助 communication not smooth, project progress is difficult to推进...
Therefore, after focusing on product innovation and research and development management for ten years，中天华夏咨询 has helped numerous outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of research and development key personnel such as product managers and project managers. And it has been recognized as the "Training Center for Chinese enterprises' Research and Development Management Key personnel" and other titles. With the online course "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Camp", Zhonghua Xia Yue consulting is here.
"The Product Development Project Manager Special Training Course" online course: This is a online fragmented learning method that combines practical examples, tools, and methods from numerous research and development enterprises, helping you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the next step in your own project management.
This is also a opportunity for businesses to promote the training process of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, bringing about efficient operation results.
While my translation may not be as precise as the original, it's still尽力接近了：  Since words alone do not provide evidence, it's recommended to first look at how other students have evaluated this course: This course not only features the Chinese Academy of Management's local team (formerly the Huawei Research and Development Management Team) but also combines advanced global project management methodologies with authentic business scenarios from many leading enterprises. It provides in-depth and professional explanations of course content.
We will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and help learners convert the learning content into practical applications after class.

JX net encourages理性消费 before the Cyber Monday sale
This year, the total transaction amount of online payment services across the country during the "11th National Day of the Internet Sales Festival" reached 1.77 trillion yuan, again setting new records compared to previous years.
The variety of discount vouchers, intriguing virtual shopping直播， and once-again benefits for consumers have once again contributed to a surge in consumption. On one hand, this consumption boom leaves people感叹 the increasingly strong national consumption力. On the other hand, it is also necessary to think carefully about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream消费群体 of contemporary times.
Before the "Black Friday" arrival, JCI Home Finance Co., Ltd. (以下简称“捷信”) issued a理性消费 promotion, reminding广大的用户， especially young people, of the importance of setting good consumption awareness and consumption habits，拒绝盲目消费和过度消费.
According to the "Consumer Financial 素养调查分析报告" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national index of consumer financial literacy has been improved by 2.04 points compared to 2019.
Overall, the performance of our residents on the financial consumption level is good, but there is significant diversity in their financial behavior and skills. Furthermore, it is necessary to further improve the basic level of financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy among older adults and adolescents is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of持续关注 financial education. The "Chinese Young People's DebtSituation Report" by尔森 and the "2019-2020 Chinese Young People's consumption Report" by China Central television财经 show that the younger generation has tremendous consumption potential and credit consumption is an important path for personal consumption升级. 86.6% of young people are using credit products and half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the overall consumption trend of the younger generation shows rational consumption, which is different from the label of "over-spending" put forward by the outside world, some young people indeed have excessive consumption and follow the trend, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risk, even leading to gradually increasing social problems. Businesses should be willing to assume their social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, JXI信用一直致力於以高品质、贴心的服务助力於百姓建构自己的幸福生活。We recommend consumers establish a good and right consumption attitude and actively respond to regulatory calls to raise their rational consumption awareness, particularly among young people.
Over the past few years, JXI has continuously conducted comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge distribution activities targeting young groups, including college students, through various forms such as innovation practical competitions collaborating with top-notch universities in China to gradually influence the young group's consumer demand and help them establish rational consumption ideas, and efficiently plan their consumption needs, ultimately supporting their accumulation of life assets.
As the Black Friday comes, JCI reminds all consumers' friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct money perspective, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer credit pitfalls, and do not affect their personal credit report and future economic life.
When spending, it's important to plan in advance and be mindful of your financial situation and make regular payments on your debts.
If there is a late payment, the account will be recorded on your personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on your future economic activities such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to examine whether these institutions have the necessary business qualifications.
In the future, JCI will continue to bring together with consumers more tailor-made and diverse services through its mature and reliable消費金融反饋系統 and constantly updating and iterating金融产品. It will continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the idea of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a trusted消費金融反饋 partner for consumers for a lifetime.

越南 People's報實體 - 貝貝萬斯合作委员会面對共同挑戰
The stops of沙特 prince穆罕默德本萨勒曼 include Manama, United Arab Emirates (阿联酋)，卡塔尔， Bath, and科威特.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit by the prince of Morocco to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a trade ban on Qatar in年年 2017, which led to the海湾外交危机.
During this crisis，沙特阿拉伯，阿联酋，岳阳， and Egypt had断绝 their diplomatic relations with Qatar and实施 comprehensive sanctions against it，指责 Qatari support for terrorist organizations while having close ties with伊朗.
The foreign policy tensions have greatly impacted the internal unity of the Heian League, and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have sealed the land, sea, and air routes leading to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the海湾合作委员会 (Gulf Cooperation Council)峰会 in January 2021, where the海湾国家 signed an agreement aimed at "Unity and Stability" through the mediation of the United States and科威特.
Saudi Arabia has resumed border control with Qatar.
沙特阿拉伯 and埃及 are actively working to restore their relationship with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by both countries.
The海湾阿拉伯国家 have resolved their differences in order to restore their relationship with Qatar, following the requirement to unite for the benefit of各国 and regional stability, with the aim of addressing shared challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land通道 between two adjacent海湾 countries.
The long通道 that connects the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Yemen, and both enterprises have signed 13 cooperation MOUs worth $30 billion.
The visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to the海湾 countries came during negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to挽救 the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that海湾阿拉伯国家谴责 as无法解决 their导弹问题 with Iran.
各海湾国家 have always viewed Iran as a long-term " competitor" and have regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "威胁" to the regional security.
的各个海湾国家认为，不解决伊朗导弹问题，不采取采取行动来遏制伊朗在该地区的活动是有缺陷的。
In the context that the nuclear negotiations between major countries and Iran have not met the desires of the波斯湾 countries，沙特阿拉伯 and Iran have conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to prevent the upgrading of the tension in the region.
This is one of the factors减缓ing the经济增长 of the countries in the海湾 Cooperation Council.
The upcoming AICPA峰会 will be the first summit of countries from the AICPA since the dispute between some member states and Qatar was resolved.
This is the opportunity for the海湾 Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the外交 achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Qinghai-uzem Conference, while also proposing measures to enable member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and making contributions to the stability and development of the海湾 countries.

He claims to have the largest exhaust note of super cars in the new mountain area!
This vehicle that our team is bringing you is a dream for many men!
It's the main旗舰 supercar ofLamborghini, the next-generation Murcielago replacement - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is approximately KMT 2 million, and the one-year road tax is KMT 10,000, with four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700马力？
Well, then I'm sorry, but the editor doesn't know either. The data says that the acceleration from 0 to 100km/h takes only 2.9 seconds. It seems that when myvi is only going at 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h. I'm sorry about that.
The low-cut body, exuberant剪刀门， large air intake口 throughout the body, and a stunning 6.5 v12 engine under glass, perfectly capture the spirit ofLamborghini.
The English translation for this sentence is: "The description of the car model doesn't need to be too much, just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not provide."
Being too备受瞩目， no matter where you go, everyone is looking at you, it's not natural! (Actually, it's a little爽).
The cost of fuel for 1km is around RM1左右 (the车主根本不care)
Practice the way to and from the bus stop, otherwise it would be a bit awkward (Because you would not be able to get out of the bus seat and would be stuck at either half)
The engine sound was too loud, and after下车， I felt like I had耳朵聋了. ( Still, it was very enjoyable though.)
The car is too big, and putting it into a standard parking space will be too narrow. I am afraid that I will be hit by the car of the next door when it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely, because there's no opponent on the road (this is a joke, not related to the homeowner, ha ha).
Don't get confused, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Thank you for your invitation! If you want to take a video of your property, welcome to contact us!

Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 - I believe that teammates all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the car price of a Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Just a few minutes ago, the foreign country撞到了百万跑车 911, as well as a million-dollar supercar Chiron!
Look at the results, the price is worth it!
"Resonating大学精神 with the spirit of the times-新华网"
So, what we call "the spirit of the university" is a series of campus management ideas and values that have been accumulated over a long period of development in a university's growth, and it is the essence of the university.
From ancient to modern times, the spirit of the university has been crucial for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even for the progress of a nation.
Since the first modern-day university was born, universities have carried out a unique mission that is different from that of other social organizations. For our universities, which emerged during a time of national crisis, their spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of time. We promote the values of " Spreading knowledge and making the world a better place" and "Invoking education to build a strong country" as爱国主义担当.
Currently, the trend of digitalization and国际化 of higher education is becoming more prominent, and the global competition in education, technology, and talent is constantly increasing. As an important "supply side" of higher education，结构性改革 of the higher education industry is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "Overall Strategy for the Creation of World-class universities and infrastructure" demonstrates our confidence and determination to move towards becoming a world-class高等教育 country, while also posing higher and more updating requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive for rapid advancement and rapid construction of several top-notch universities and a batch of top-notch disciplines within a relatively short time while still leaving some room for improvement, in order to achieve "overtaking the curve"?
In addition to having a strong confidence in goals, paths, and abilities, universities should also fully utilize three advantages: first, the advantage of reaction, which is to continuously引进 outstanding academic talent from outside the world, learn from and consult with world-class universities, and significantly improve academic levels and teaching quality; second, the advantage of culture, which inherits the wisdom内涵 of the Chinese nation's five thousand years of history and promotes the development of traditional and cultural advanced products, thus clarifying force, shaping brand, and improving image; third, the advantage of制度， which utilizes the advantages of socialist countries and strengthens goal-driven, collects consensus, combine efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for universities to accelerate catch up with world-class levels.
It is especially important to understand that building top-notch universities is not possible without diversity. Each school must showcase its unique characteristics while leveraging its strengths.
The unique features of educational development should not only include common Chinese characteristics but also reflect each other's unique objectives, educational traditions, and resource strengths.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects in our education: first, we emphasize the development of innovation and entrepreneurship training talents, constructing an integrated learning environment combining education and research, and forming a whole chain of innovation education ecosystems; second, we emphasize the focus on interdisciplinary clusters, promoting the optimization and adjustment of academic disciplines, creating a theoretical environment of interdisciplinary clusters, actively nurturing interdisciplinary emerging fields and标志性 interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the development of educational systems and social services, carrying out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the development of a comprehensive Zhejiang University-industry- academia-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain and promote the spirit of university, which should resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the slogan "Jia Yu Xin Xin Xin" and the common values of "Hard study, cultivation of virtue, discernment, and hardiness" along with " absorb the rivers and open up true and profound virtue, educate the people before others, build my country and nation" form the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important assurance for the school to maintain the correct direction of operates and continuously accumulate cultural achievements and精神力量， which has rich connotations and far-reaching consequences.
Among them, "Hena river" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the sentiment of using the "barks of the world's best minds" and the quality of attracting world renowned universities for teaching and nurturing students. "Enlightening truth and ethics" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and excellence, suggesting that while universities strive to achieve truth, they should also cultivate ethics and character. "Innovation and reform" reflects the spirit of change and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, scientific research, and the transformation of existing systems. "Building our nation's country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and奉献精神， suggesting that universities should always be at the forefront of national development and辱 and荣.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of teaching.
The English translation for this sentence is: "聪者听于无声，明者见于未形" 。
chinese universities should further immerse themselves in the overall development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the historical position and mission they hold in the contemporary era, and rapidly accelerate their progress towards becoming world-class universities.
At the same time, it should adhere to the values of humanism and individual independence, and cultivate the spirit of college education with the spirit of the times and national spirit, providing endless motivation for the development of a country and the revitalization of a nation, as well as the common aspirations of humanity.

As NFTs quickly go mainstream, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a significant impact in the Southeast Asia region. residents who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to receive stable income through this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet ownership game based on blockchain technology, which集合s various gameplay elements, including NFTs, and is currently the highest-transactional NFT project with over $3 billion in total sales as of now.
TokenTerminal's data shows that the daily revenue of Axie Infinity has topped $8.2 million，直逼《王者荣耀》。
On August 6th of this year, the official Axie Infinity website stated that the daily active user base has exceeded 10 million.

In addition to gaining乐趣 and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game's ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not awarded to the game developers, but rather ensures through blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about the price of a friend's stock, my biggest reaction was that companies choose the track, which refers to the selection of target industries. First of all, they choose industries with large growth potential, at least with a market size of more than 10 billion yuan. Secondly, they choose industries with good future growth prospects, considering reaching the best state of growth in 3-5 years from now. Finally, they choose industries that are supported by government policies.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or崎岖 refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.

In the new year, the first thing that will happen is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The strategy在于 "do the things right", that is, make the right choices.
The strategy在于 "do the right thing", which means doing the correct thing.
Strategy involves finding direction, and tactics involve getting it done. There is room for strategic thinking above and beyond most tactical considerations.
For example, above increasing customer numbers ( tactical thinking), one can think of whether it is necessary to continue deepening into the current field or expanding into other horizontal fields ( strategic thinking). Similarly, above enhancing customer retention rates ( tactical thinking), one can consider how to enhance the retention rates of core customers and high-value customers ( strategic thinking). Above enhancing activity engagement ( tactical thinking), one can consider how to set appropriate activity KPIs and achieve correct activity goals, such as enhancing target customer engagement，激活 high-value沉默 customers, and accurately promoting new customers. Above enhancing daily active users ( tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

An Asian American group filed a complaint against three Ivy League schools，耶鲁大学， Princeton University, and Harvard University, about recruiting歧视-新华网.
The US Department of Justice and the US Department of Education received complaints from 130 Asian-American groups on May 23 against three top Ivy League universities –耶鲁大学，布朗大学， and达特茅斯学院 – for discriminatory practices in their admissions processes against Asian-American applicants.
The Asian American Education Alliance, leading the appeal, held a press conference the same day in Washington.
The president of the group, Zhao Yuxiang, said in a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the requirements for admission to top American universities has increased by倍数， but the proportion of Asian applicants among these three top American universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that during the so-called " Comprehensive Consideration" recruitment process of these universities, they "歧视 Long-term and systematically Asian-American applicant students."
Zhao Yukong explained that according to a study by桑德斯 et al. in 2014, among these three universities, the application rate for Asian students is the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivies, Brown University anddartmouth College have the lowest录取 rates for Asian students, while耶鲁大学 and布朗大学 have implemented in practice racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuquan told journalists from新华社 that they expected the US Department of Education and Department of Justice to conduct investigations after submitting the complaint, and after recognizing the facts, to take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to歧视 Asian students in their enrollment decisions.
They also hope that the universities that have been投诉d can take proactive action to address this issue and modify their recruitment policies towards Asian students.
Currently, the three universities complaint about have not yet made a response.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and initially filed a complaint against Harvard University's recruitment歧视， but the United States Department of Education did not take action on this matter due to technical reasons.
In addition to the American Chinese group participating in this appeal, there are also education groups from India，韩国人， Japan, and Pakistan in the United States.

I just cancelled my order.
Why is it still in progress?

But I already made a purchase at 9:00 AM on the morning.
There's a restaurant reservation line there, and they don't know what to say.
Can you contact them directly by phone?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yuytin Town，余姚市， from a real estate agent in Zhejiang. After viewing the building multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase it.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu consultationed with the owner of the factory's family member Lin for the details of purchasing the factory, and on that day, he sent 20 million yuan through a bank transfer as a down payment.
Lin某签名并注明， "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this定金 belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the定金 will be returned twice to the seller. The parties agree to sign the Factory Sales Contract within one week."
However, after this, the parties could not reach consensus on the main contract terms such as the sale scope of the factory and the payment terms, resulting in the delay of the residential contract signing.
Considering that the parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, a few days later, Lin某 returned the 200,000 deposit to Mr. Lu.
After trying hard to buy a house, the advance payment was made, and the house price was ready. Just when it was about to take the contract, the seller wouldn't sell. This made Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu起诉了林某至余姚市人民法院。
After examining the case, the court finds that the parties' ultimate inability to sign a formal contract cannot be attributed solely to the被告， and should be reasonable interpreted as a failure to consult. Therefore, the定金罚则 should not be applied in this case, and the被告 is not required to pay the damages of double返还定金.
After the first appeal, the plaintiff filed a second appeal.
Recently, the second court稳定地保留了 its original judgment.
【Legal advice】 Be sure to comply with the necessary due diligence obligations during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer should exercise the necessary care and attention, such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property is occupied by others, and clarifying the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when履行合同.
After the Friday“民主峰会” ended, the foreign policy spokesperson of the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Saturday ( December 11th), said that the United StatesHosting the“leadership民主峰会” was“划意识形态的界限，将民主工具化、武器化，以民主的名义行反民主之实，煽动分裂对抗，转移国内矛盾。”
The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has强加于人 its own political system and value principles, promoting "民主 transformation", applying单边制裁滥觞，策动ing "color revolutions", and causing catastrophic consequences.
民主 has long been a "large-scale weapons of mass destruction" for the US to interfere in other countries.
This峰会 is an action of Biden fulfilling his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was conducted through video conferencing, with 111 national leaders from around the world invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the US has no right to host such a summit.
There are also质疑声音 from the international and national sides. For example, some criticized the invitees to the summit, including leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines，波兰， and Brazil, and it was suspected that the true purpose of组织了这次峰会 of Biden's government was not to promote democracy but rather for geopolitical reasons.
The newly上任德国总理舒尔茨 also participated in the video democratic峰会.
The statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Saturday says, "Today's American democracy is in a state of crisis, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, political polarization, party对立， political polarization, social分裂， racial conflict, and income inequality growing increasingly severe. American democracy is a "luxury game" built on capital that is being played by the wealthy."
President Joe Biden of the United States said in his speech, "As leaders of our government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the firewall of democracy, drive改革， achieve transparent and accountable governance, and better protect against the forces of专制 that offer neither buffer nor protection, and those who seek to pursue power openly and regardless of公共利益."
He stressed that democracy does not come naturally and, "We must update it with each generation. In my view, this is the crucial challenge of our time."
Biden also said that when facing continuous and alarming challenges globally in the field of democracy and human rights, " Democracy requires warriors to defend it."
The United States has promised that after this democratic summit, a year-long行动 will be launched, including an initiative with a total amount of 4.244亿美元， to strengthen democracy in世界各地 and provide support to independent media organizations.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public promises before the实体 democratic峰会 which is planned for the end of 2022 to improve their民主 systems.
Biden said, "Let's all implement our commitments and report on the progress we've made by next year."
Okay, I just fear that he sent the wrong address.
Japanese Restaurant (五道口店)
[Grape薄荷] Environment: The most average.  [ServiceBell] Services: The food is very quickly served. "The Traditional Chinese马拉糕" is my must-try dish. The马拉糕 is too delicious and soft, it is so delicious😋. If you are someone who enjoys甜品， you must try "Zhujiang Fish Engaging豆腐煲". The soup is very delicious, the豆腐 is very delicate, the fish is...
The English translation for this sentence is: The taste is excellent, the meat is delicious, and the service is friendly.
I've been away from Jing昌 for a while now, but the fruit salad is still so delicious and full of genuine ingredients. The first time I ordered the叉烧包， I got the南方-style松软面粉 taste that I love!
The煲仔饭 is just right when it's dry and full of flavor, and the signature锡纸鸡翅 are still delicious, as always. The regular soup is also quite nice, and the 芥兰 is处理得也比较好，比较 fresh and delicious.
The English translation for the sentence "味道赞 服务热情 肉类好" is "The taste is excellent, the service is passionate, the meat is good."
The old store, Hi昌， was also a popular Netizen several years ago. It was a small building on the east side of the street, with floor-to-ceiling windows and marble countertops.
The pot-based soup at the door takes a long time to be served, and the pot used for the soup has broken.
I haven't used Japanese昌 for a few years now, and the rise of various small businesses offering Cantonese cuisine has diversified the traffic.
You'll have a seat at the restaurant once you arrive, the food quality is excellent, it's always like that.
The English translation for the sentence "味道赞 肉类好 主食赞" is: "The taste is excellent, the meat is good, and the main dish is excellent."
"日昌外卖"
Rice meal: This dish was a bit disappointment, just a little.
Three-course生理上的饮料： the vegetables are a bit too much, and the meat is a bit too little.
The main taste of this dish is a bit off, as the savory taste is not enough, which emphasizes the sweetness. Imagine a sweet and various spices seasonings...
What is the drink method for Red Label威士忌？
Each person has their own preferences. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat, and of course, there are those who enjoy trying new things. Red Label威士忌 is one of the most popular苏格兰威士忌s in all countries today, and it has also won the Best苏格兰威士忌 Award at the international洋酒大赛.
Each red label威士忌 has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, it's a shame to waste its rich flavor.
What to do with the Red Book威士忌？
Let us give you a quick introduction for everyone.
Red Label威士忌喝法：
The Red Label whiskey from United States is mixed with about 35 types of Scottish whiskey, which have a rich aroma and traditional Scottish whiskey characteristics, including a sweet and smoky flavor.
The first bite is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and a strong火星糖麦芽 flavor.
This wine can be consumed straight from the glass, or it can be mixed with your favorite drink.
The Red Label威士忌 has entered domestic markets, and in order to cater to the preferences of the Chinese people, the Red Label威士忌 + Coca-Cola，雪碧， or新奇士等 sparkling饮料 has become a timeless fashion.
These sweet饮料， in addition to中和ing the酸味， can also bring visual pleasure to the user. Adding them to the饮料 can also effectively reduce the alcohol taste and change the texture of the drink.
Red Label威士忌+ slices of lemon+ cubed sugar (or sugar if you prefer) is the most traditional and正宗的 drinking method.
The authentic red方威 has a slightly bitter taste, adding sugar can balance the bitterness, and the lemon will bring a fresh scent to the drink. Of course, the sweetness and bitterness can be adjusted according to individual preferences.
These three are the best ways to enjoy Red Label威士忌. Feel free to use them as a reference and I hope the article can be helpful to you.
Education Analysis: How college exams can make "learning monsters" and "learning disasters" achieve their goals
Three students from Lanzhou University wrote to the school leadership, expressing their confusion about university exams and提出 their demand for increasing exam difficulty, changing考试 formats, and真正 reflecting the students' actual level of ability.
Indeed, university exams have long been a "hot topic".
In the university's campus, students come from different regions of the country, with varying levels of ability and learning experiences. This results in a wide range of learning environments.
Evaluating a group with such diverse characteristics can lead to different perceptions, which is undoubtedly inevitable.
Of course, if the examination questions have a single type with high repetition, and the questions are too simple, it will result in a completely different experience.
A student who doesn't work hard may pass the exam by just studying before the exam, and if they want to achieve better results, they may consider other methods.
As a result, there is a "learning酥" who can pass with little effort even though they don't really take their classes, and a "learning狂" who always attends classes, performs well in all their assignments and notes, but doesn't even score higher than their peers on exams. This strange phenomenon has emerged.
From this perspective, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University indicate that the problems in university exams are not arbitrary, and it is believed that this situation is not only present in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I want to praise these three students for their straightforward writing.
In fact, people who have studied at university know that there is a phenomenon of突击备考， trying to find ways to "get" questions from teachers，争取划考试范围， and getting "intensive guidance" before the exam. It is not an uncommon sight, and even incidents of carrying small copies of answers during the exam and asking teachers to help them out after the exam are not rare.
In my view, as a guide to evaluating the quality of teaching and learning, the合格 of a university examination is more important than the comprehensive understanding of teachers and scientific propositions on the basis of it.
Enter the undergraduate curriculum, and departments begin to specialize, many major courses are primarily focused on fundamental knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether one has a thorough understanding of the basic concepts of a subject is what大学 exams assess.
本科知识 largely consists of basic theories and common sense in specific fields, and from the perspective of knowledge points, there is little change and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher mentioned, "Learning the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being studied and is still a focus today."
However, the basic knowledge remains the same, which does not necessarily mean that the exam questions are limited to a single type of problem and the problems are repeated.
In many universities, exams usually consist of a出题 team and then the试卷 are composed of experienced teachers in the field. The examination review process also involves the participation of all teachers who teach the subject, which can help to overcome the phenomenon of repeated questions.
However, to develop a set of questions that align with the practical teaching and learning, the problems should be designed based on the overall student learning situation, with difficulty呈正态分布. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively understand the teaching situation and analyze the level of student learning. This will enable the exam命题 to have a dynamic understanding of difficulty and types of questions, highlighting the考察 of fundamental knowledge while兼顾能力考查， and designing innovative questions.
The exam is the steering wheel of university education; whatever exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans. As a result, it will have an impact on the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's suggestions letter, the校方 of Lanzhou Jiao Tong University is very serious and has already implemented a solution for improvement throughout the school.
Request各教学单位 to organize teachers to carry out discussions and self-evaluations of course assessments, develop assessment question design and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and checking of assessment question design and review processes，细化 assessment judgments, and enhance comprehensive evaluation of various aspects of course teaching.
Solving the issue of having a single type of question and repeated questions through the mechanism is a problem that university exam administration needs to address. Of course, there needs to be corresponding measures. However, the key is in daily practice, which requires teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of teaching conditions. not only should they understand the content of the course, but also understand the learning conditions of students. Through this, teaching and learning can better match and form a good interaction, and the exams will be more realistic, thus allowing both "学霸" and "学渣" to achieve their goals.

Goldie's wedding photography (南街店) - Currently there are no branches.
Before the拍照， because we didn't arrange our time properly, we had to change twice, and our advisor Lan Lan was very patient and helped us arrange our time.
Later, I chose to take photos during a good weather weekend.
The staff of gold夫人， whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are absolutely outstanding.
That was my first formal makeup application in my life, and I can't believe it! I can't even believe that one day I will look so great, ha ha ha!
XiaoJie and another girl ( sorry, I can't remember her name) are very patient when化和装逼， and their化妆 is also very natural.
The exterior shots were taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and we didn't feel very cold. During the shooting, the makeup artist constantly paid attention to our clothes and accessories, and if anything went wrong, she immediately helped us to organize.
The photographer is also very humorous, and he/she always feels very happy after taking a photo.
When choosing的照片， because of the many cases seen online, we are not willing to let our guests delete too many pictures. However, when we were choosing the pictures, we really did not want to add more pictures to the套餐 - we just selected the 24 pictures that were included in the套餐. (I heard that my堂妹 who took her wedding photography about a year ago also added over a thousand pictures to her seven thousand-dollar套餐， and I was completely shocked. I also worried that I might choose too many pictures).
The photos were repaired today, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two of them and felt that they were not quite right. They immediately helped me repair them.
When comparing the pictures of my sister that she took before, I feeling so satisfied with our photographs. They are simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I truly recommend that everyone visit Xuanhan Jin夫人 for photography!

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货
(As of November 11, Queensland): The沙巴国民登记局 says that due to the depletion of custom-made防伪 paper stock, it has been unable to issue baby newspapers to newly born babies since October. The受影响 individuals have reached 3,200 as of today.
However, the director of that department，凯鲁阿米努斯， guarantees that all婴儿 who have applied for birth certificates will have their information recorded in the system, and a duplicate certificate will be provided when the伪造 certificates arrive next week.
In a press conference, he explained the issue of the paper printing problem in the沙巴 newspaper for more than a year, which was reported by a net媒.
He said that the issue has appeared two months ago, and砂拉越 is also facing the same problem.
One reason is that the Chinese manufacturer of special anti-counterfeit paper, affected by the pandemic, resulting in delay in bringing it to our country.
He explains that the防伪 paper used in the沙巴 newspaper is different from that used in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow inventory from other state-owned enterprises.
Karunanis reveals that the latest batch of防伪 paper has arrived in吉隆坡 on本月 6th, and will be delivered to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work to be completed.
Next Thursday, a team will go to吉隆坡 to pick up the goods, and then they will proceed with the final stage of printing in沙巴. It is expected that it will take approximately two working days (on December 20th) to hand the goods over to the申请者.
"We will inform applicants to visit各个分局 for paper for the newspaper."
He added that since January this year，沙巴 has issued 24,801 sheets of newsprint.
I've been waiting since 7:00 AM today.
Is it almost here?
I am referring to food.
I'm right there on the other side of #PRS_ORG#.
Good, thank you. Because the restaurant said they were ready.

The central theme of the Party's work is to manage both domestic and international issues comprehensively, maintain a steady and progressive approach, and coping with the century-long changes and the world-wide epidemics while maintaining a calm mind. We are focusing on constructing a new development landscape, strengthening macro-policy inter-generational adjustment, promoting economic sustainable development and growth, and deepening reform and opening up innovation. We are striving to complete the difficult task of reform and development and achieve new significant achievements in all aspects of the Party and the country.

The President of the捷克奥林匹克 Committee: He is convinced that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during a special period. -新华网
According to the official news agency of波斯尼亚 and Herzegovina, S Agency News of Tuesday, December 11, President Cvetic recently stated that波黑s are very excited for the Beijing Winter Olympics and believe that China has the ability to deliver a successful Winter Olympics event during special times.
Recently, the Ambassador of China to波黑 Qiping Zhiping met with the President of the波斯尼亚奥林匹克 Committee, Jordan K维西奇 at the奥林匹克中心 in萨拉热窝.
At the meeting，韦西奇 positively evaluated the relationship between Germany and the Chinese and said that he had visited China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, where he was impressed by the outstanding organization work of the Chinese. He believed that China had the ability to hold a successful Olympics during special circumstances. The Germany delegation was very excited about the Beijing冬奥会 and the匈奥委会 was actively organizing the participation. Germany hoped to take this opportunity to engage in more extensive exchange and cooperation with the Chinese in the field of sports.
Qianping said that the China-Bosnia两国 have a special "奥林匹克 bond."
The Winter Games in萨拉热窝 in 1984 were successfully completed here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Games will start, presenting the world with a简约， secure, and exciting event.
We look forward to further enhancing economic and cultural exchange between the two countries in the areas of winter sports preparation，运动员 training, and other areas. The Chinese embassy in匈匈 is willing to continue playing the role of a bridge, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote further deepened humanistic exchanges between the two countries, let the people of both countries " Approach the Future Together," and wish the匈匈 sports enthusiasts in Beijing good results.
Before the meeting, the克罗地亚奥林匹克 Committee held the "10th Best运动员 of the Year" ceremony, where季平， as a special guest, awarded the Best Young运动员 title to the best athletes of克罗地亚.

After 48 hours of COVID-19 testing negative, the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issues a circular requiring the strengthening of COVID-19 prevention and control in border city areas. -新华网
The Federal Ministry of Health and Social Protection issued a notice on December 11, 2022, increasing the security measures for border cities，要求 recent departures from land border cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and澳门 through ports) to hold negative COVID-19 tests within 48 hours. For those traveling to land border cities, at least one test should be performed upon arrival.
According to the notice, the timeline for the above requirements is from the date when each county and city determines the port city scope and publishes it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice proposes that border cities with conditions can study the implementation of health prevention and control buffer zones in their areas.
According to the Director of the National Health and Medical Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Department, cross-border trade is a major economic支柱 for some border cities, and the between- country people have frequent exchanges.
Implement分区差异化 management policies, transforms from a single prevention of export control barrier to two security barriers, with the aim of advancing the border control and reducing the risk of epidemic export. The implementation of this policy is expected to achieve the maximum benefit in epidemic prevention and control, with minimal social impact and lowest social costs.
In recent times, there have been several local clusters of infectious diseases in our country, all of which were imported from outside through border cities.
The above-mentioned notification indicates that this reveals the lack of timely疫情 monitoring and warning systems, incomplete闭环 management of high-risk jobs, regular DNA testing in place but not effective, inadequate clean-up and vaccination efforts in the cold chain，不规范 management of centralized隔离 facilities, and insufficient scientific and targeted timely responses to the pandemic.
The notice requires efforts in 9 aspects, such as improving border control mechanisms, strengthening disease monitoring and warning systems, and implementing边境 control measures, to accelerate the filling of gaps and weaknesses in border city epidemic prevention and control, strictly放松大意， scientifically and精准ly carry out the epidemic prevention and control work, and create a dense and solid external prevention and control barrier.
The notice emphasizes that the cities at border crossing should research and deploy the public health prevention and relief work in parallel with the work of basic life support，公布 and maintain the openness of the public support line, regularly check for early warning signs in the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly solve and respond to the major issues reported by the people's feedback.
According to the notification, the cities referred to in this sentence include the county(city, district, flag) where the land, water, and air ports are opened, the city(state, province, alliance) and the capital city, and the capital city of the province(region, state, province). The specific scope will be determined and announced by the各省(自治区、直辖市)根据疫情防控需要 and published according to their needs.

Online video reveals the truth of the US military's 20 years of bloodthirsty杀戮 -新华网
The video source is on YouTube.
On December 11th, a micro documentary titled "杀戮机器" on YouTube gained widespread attention.
This film tells the story of the US launching the阿富汗 war under the name of "反恐，"强行 exporting American democracy through the war, becoming spendthrift, bloodthirsty, and repeatedly killing innocent people for 20 years，犯下 numerous human rights abuses.
The misuse of drones to bomb civilian areas such as hospitals and schools扭曲s human nature and sets up a杀人 team.
In the past 20 years, the US military has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in阿富汗.
The US military has set "black cells" to carry out various forms of torture and人格侮辱 upon "嫌犯".
The一件件反人类罪行 only fuels the anger of more阿富汗ians.
As the video says, the American " Counter-Strike" war is "from counter-arguments, to恐怖主义".
The war did not bring peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of阿富汗， but only a devastated country and countless killing and destruction.
Click the video and let's together expose the truth of the US's love of blood杀戮 under the name of "反恐", and戳穿 the虚伪 mask of American democracy!
I accidentally saw a article discussing why this customer needed a logistics company in the customs warehouse to do packaging. Although packaging is a deep processing and is not within the scope of the customs warehouse logistics company's operations, this article may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have been to many milk banks and had contact with many milk production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for袋装 and听装奶粉 are exactly the same, there is no difference between them.
So, everyone will definitely ask why the shelf life of boxed items is one year, while the shelf life of listening items is two years or even longer?
Or may I ask: Why are the prices for hearing aids in盒子装 and boxed装 such a large difference?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers, or even mothers, believe that because the raw materials are different, the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are all the same, but everyone believes that the expensive ones are good.
There are also consumers who after eating it react saying the taste or texture of listen-in is different!
Now let me explain to everyone why hearing aids are expensive first, and where they are expensive.
Why is the price difference so great despite the same raw materials?
Since manufacturers generally consider that the price of boxed goods should be reasonable if the price is too high, the consumer is unlikely to accept it, this means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is low or non-existent. What does the manufacturer依靠什么呢？
Therefore, they have taken a large upward increase in the price of listening装 to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers prefer听装 over袋形.
Additionally, you mentioned that each year, many manufacturers incur costs of millions or even billions in advertising expenses. Where do these costs come from?
How可以想象大家。
So as society develops, the marketing expenses for markets, such as promoting personnel in shopping malls, display fees in shopping malls, product赠品 costs, and advertising expenses, also continue to increase.
Therefore, each manufacturer is constantly adding new products, especially sound-powered, and their prices are also continuously rising. These are new products that have emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain a higher profit, actually the cost increase of their raw materials would not be more than 3 or 4 yuan.
Another part of the brand, in order to promote their products, has no mercy and goes to any extent. They associate themselves with doctors in hospitals, allowing them to assist in the promotion of the product and take a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a一听.
China's relevant laws absolutely prohibit such操作方法， which is actually harmful to consumers.

When shopping at a book market, you often can feel the excitement of success学-related books.
Many modern business books promote the "best principle" - that is, they assume or suggest that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to "do."
It means that you have just gone through the most important and fundamental step of the process, which is actually the most crucial one.
Therefore, it is this way that all of these books have a common feature - either you work to the best of your ability, or you don't do anything; either you reach 100, or you don't; either you climb the mountain, or you stay where you are.
This "best principle" would be acknowledged by anyone as " perfectly correct" but 99% of people will be intimidated and fall short before the starting line.
因为这种理论 advocates a path of "making a hard decision, getting back on track, and making a 180-degree turn" that is exactly what many people lack.
When dealing with someone who values tradition, sticking to the old ways, and拒绝 change, you would rather loudly tell them "You need to change" in their face, it is undoubtedly a misleading and foolish act.
Most people will feel intimidated by the word "转变" and hesitate, making difficult decisions; or they may give in to a sudden surge of passion and make the first step, but it is often short-lived and they fall short, making it difficult to see sustained progress.
Mr. March's famous comedy sketch "From tomorrow on" is the classic that most accurately embodies this "common humanity."
The greatest problem with the "best principle" is that it has a high threshold, often exceeding the ability limits of ordinary people, leaving most people "admiring the door".
Perhaps, the "次好原则" is just one way that could potentially lead to more ordinary people pursuing a relatively successful path.
The core of the "次好原则" is "reduce the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "build up small gains to big gains", that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 always greater than 0. If you can't climb to the top of the mountain, doing just the small在沙滩上的小石子 is okay too, because it's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing at all.
Due to a significant decrease in the threshold, there is a higher likelihood for people to persevere, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
The path to success, following the "次好原则，" is just a bit longer than necessary.
In summary, while "the best principle" may表面上看起来 promote the success of everyone, it ultimately can only motivate a small number; whereas "the second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and maximize the benefits for as many as possible.
Will I need to place a new order now?

The catch of wild caught salmon in the Salmo Salar lake has increased by 710,000 pounds this year, according to a news article from新华网.
According to a news article from the China Daily on December 11, 2023 (记者骆晓飞、张宏祥), the latest monitoring results show that the catch of青海湖裸鲤 has increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is a total increase of more than 40 times compared to the early beginning of protection in 2002.
The paddlefish in Lake青海湖 is commonly known as "thu month" in Chinese, and it is a unique and valuable fish species in the lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in the lake's region.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human-induced high fishing pressure, the numbers of wild salmon (Salmon upwelling) in the青海湖 area were rapidly reduced. In 2002, the total stockable resource of wild salmon in the青海湖 area was only 2,592吨.
In 2004, the Chinese物种 red list listed the青海湖裸鲤 as endangered.
Starting in 2003, the State Council of China has implemented the policy of surrounding lakes to cultivate fish. It has been prohibited for any unit, group, or individual to fish for raw salmon or its products in the Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and branches.
At the same time, through ongoing efforts such as artificial growth promotion releases, cleaning and美化 the main channel of the Qinghai-Tibet Lake lake-waterway, designing科学合理 "fish passage" and improving water quality, the resource reserves of Qinghai-Tibet Lake white sturgeon have been gradually increasing.
Yang Lin, vice director of the Ministry of农业 and农村 Affairs of Qinghai Province，介绍道，截止到目前，Qinghai Lake white鲤鱼 have been implemented in total of nearly 18 million尾 artificial generative streams, with a contribution rate of more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake white鲤鱼 resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area for China and even for Asia. The Lake Qinghai is a natural barrier and ecological functional area controlling the extension of desertification in the Western part of the country.
In order to protect the ecological environment and aquatic wildlife in the Three阶梯 regions and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau lake area, to maintain the生物多样性 of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and to protect the ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, from this year forward, Qinghai has先后 published禁捕 notices for key areas of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau lakes, and has established a comprehensive禁捕 management system of "one river, one lake, and one lake."

The restaurant only gave me a bag to hold it in, and it's too cold outside.
I'd like to ask, is the delivery food packaged in a single袋子？
We only see a bag.
I'm curious about whether there was a mistake in delivery or someone took something away from us. Thank you.
It's been 1 hour and still not delivered.
I just saw a article about menstruation, it's too long.
Teach some knowledge to those who don't know.
Most girls experience their first menstrual period on a sudden day during the period of 13-15 years old, and start menstrual periods at the age of 50 or older.
Based on a healthy condition, it will be regular every month.
But it's not规律到able to predict with accuracy, it usually has a difference of about a week, and you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, bad luck can also cause a覆水难收 (翻船) situation (突然提前好几天).
The duration, amount, and degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person. Some people have cramps for three days, while others have severe cramps that make them feel like they are experiencing a medical emergency. Some people have no reaction, while others can feel so painful that they need to be transported by the police car. menstrual cramps can change with time, and previously never experienced them does not necessarily mean that they will never experience them again.
Female reproductive cycle is not under control; it continues for 24 hours from the start to the end, and there is only one thing that can be done: using pads or menstrual cups to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto the chair or clothes.
Pain in the menstrual cycle mainly stems from the production of endorphins. When the period starts and pain has not yet occurred, taking a low-fat dairy product like milk or cheese with 布洛芬 can alleviate the discomfort for the current month. However, taking 布洛芬 after the pain begins will not have much effect.
There is a risk of diarrhea before your menstrual period due to overactive imagination and excessive salivation.
If you're around your menstrual cycle, you might start getting random diarrhea, and your body usually returns to normal within two days.
Soften the pad at least two hours before bedtime, as it is prone to细菌滋生 otherwise. In the worst-case scenario, if you need to change the pad six times a day, for a total of 7 days a month, that means you need to use 42 pads. If you have pre-made pads, it may be up to 50 pads, not just one every month.
Here's the English translation for the sentence: (Please note that卫生棉条 should not be changed frequently. You can change them about every five to six hours, and the maximum duration is eight hours.)
During the menstrual cycle, hormones can be quite volatile, and during ovulation, emotional稳定性 can be affected by changes in hormones in the body. It's quite fortunate that the body does this to itself.
However, official crime statistics show that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The blood that flows is not only valuable, but also contains torn子宫内膜.
The子宫内膜 at the end of each menstrual cycle is the thinnest, and it gradually becomes thicker over the following month. It can be interpreted as that the uterus is like a house, where the uterus builds a house (thinnest子宫内膜) each month in preparation for a guest. If the guest does not come, all of the house (子宫内膜) is拆除 (menstrual排出) and built again the next month, repeating the process.
Having a period is very inconvenient. It lasts for decades and causes bleeding for several days every month, as well as pain in the abdomen and back. Who wants to deal with this?
But people can be born because their mother's body enters the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is designed to prepare the house where you will stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for having a regular and healthy menstrual cycle.
In the past, many things about women were suppression, society brain washed women as dirty and shameless, and people thought it was the case. However, the times have changed.
Some people may find it unpleasant to say that women go through pregnancy, and find the preparation behaviors they do for having a child unpleasant. It is not right to express this opinion in front of others. Women should stand up and stop thinking this way. men who have never experienced or do not understand this topic, please do not be so irresponsible and selfish. How can one have the courage to face one's mother and want to have a child with such a attitude?
Finally, sisters, try using卫生棉条吧， it's really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice holiday, and sending the wrong gift can be disappointing.
I need to order another meal for the children.
I hope the store will check the production during its busy hours.
Is it related to electrical shock with taking a bath in a bathrobe?
Choosing the right足浴盆 can not only provide excellent foot massage benefits but also have other health benefits. Today, the editor of Great China Media will address this issue and hope to be of help to friends.
With the increasing health consciousness of consumers，足浴盆 has become increasingly popular. There have also emerged a number of different levels of products on the market, from over $100 to over $1000, providing consumers with ample choices.
According to relevant data, compared to traditional household appliances, sales of health-related appliances such as足浴盆 are popular. However, there is no specific industry standard for足浴盆， which means that there is potentially a存在一定的 safety risk.
"In the waters with electricity, how dare you泡脚？"
李先生 tells the journalist that recently, he bought a泡脚盆 as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father soaks his feet in the water, he feels a sense of麻 in the脚底.
李先生 initially thought that the vibration功能 of the bathrobe was causing the sensation in his foot, but when he turned off the vibration, his father still felt a sensations in the foot.
李先生一试电笔，电笔居然亮了，他惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。
Later, he reached out to the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still quite good. Although he had returned the足浴盆，李先生 still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that there is currently no clear and detailed industry规定 for the maximum temperature setting, target audience, and materials used in these popular足浴盆.
However, in general，泡脚盆 does not have electrical problems, but it is also possible that a few products are not thoroughly checked at the factory.
Therefore, choose a split-type footbathbath when buying it.
Water power separation, there are no safety risks.
At the same time, you can pick up an electric meter to test.

Dr. In Jinling: To my friends.
I would like to express my deeply gratefulness to all my friends for the humane support they have given us during the 30 long years after our loved ones were killed, especially since I had issued appeals for humane assistance on my own behalf at the beginning of 1994 to friends at home and abroad, and this support has never been interrupted to this day.
Currently, the majority of victims' old parents have passed away, and their orphaned children are grown up and working.
Your generosity helped us these難處家庭度过了最困難的时刻.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading globally, and most of the donors are retire.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the人道 contribution to the difficult-to-be-seen mother group in Tiananmen Square, as this humanistic assistance activity should have come to an end long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and belief that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I am unable to express my will in another way. Please understand my situation!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
陶业's message: Please allow me to take this opportunity to provide a brief overview of the history of the National Association of Artistic Organizations (NAAO) and the明尼苏达 China Democracy Fund (CDF) in the field of人道主义救助.
In the process of pursuing人道主义 assistance, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Ming尼苏达的中国民主基金会 are two parallel organizations, with their执行者 often working together.
(Apple Daily Image: The mother's website at Tiananmen is managed by Taobao.)
救助 funds often cannot be successfully delivered to the six and four difficult referrals.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Dr. Ding, a specialized team was established by the "Mother of Tiananmen Square" to coordinate and distribute humanistic assistance funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Six-and-Four孤儿教育基金", which was implemented for 11 years later in 2009. After all the Six-and-Four孤儿 have graduated, in 2010, the MCDF then established the "Six-and-Four孤苦老人困难家庭救助基金", which has been in operation until today.
The funding for these projects is mainly provided by campus and social donations in the year of 1964, from generous contributions by individuals, and is supported by the Democratic Foundation of OurBrother University.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the rehabilitation research foundation.
Until last year, 13 years after the 64th anniversary, the survivors of the 1964 disaster finally received a partial contribution from Hong Kong, which had been募捐ed under the name of 1964.
During this period, the Chinese people's rights organization was also executing its人道 assistance projects independently.
We understand that Dr. Dan stopped making contributions on June 4th, as he was thinking of the捐款ers, and we are indeed some elderly people who do not have as much income as before retirement. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Dr. Dan's "Dear friends" letter.
We will respect the decision of the difficult members and terminate this project within two years, and when needed, we will immediately resume.
Thank you and respect to all the brave friends who have always shown慷慨解囊 and risked their own safety to pass on humane funding to others for years.

Time-lapse photography暂时还没有分店
Member evaluation
The effect of photos: I拍了 two sets of clothes. Overall, it's still good. I particularly like this set of photos～
Service Details: Due to pregnancy, I felt a little uncomfortable while getting dressed. The makeup artist and staff were very kind and let me rest for a while on the side. They also kept offering me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the comment from the rabbit. I originally said that I would decline to write in ancient Chinese because it is not suitable for me, but没想到 the final成品 is so beautiful that I cannot help but am impressed.
Thank you for your的认可， your satisfaction will make us full of energy to continue forward, we will continue to charging!
This photography studio is really amazing! I highly recommend all of our friends and colleagues to come!
Everything from接待， dressing up, clothing, lighting, photography, and post-production is perfect.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will arrange a suitable makeup look based on your style. The makeup products used are also from top-tier major brands.
Take田亮老师 for instance, his photography skills are quite professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, with two little猫咪 keeping it fun.
We work in Beijing. Many good photo agencies in Beijing have to stand in line for half a year before taking a photo. My colleague had a photo shoot in Beijing, and after looking at the final result, he thought it was just average.
I specifically looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we think this is also a short version for most people.摄影师亮哥 will capture each moment with a snap, recording natural and captivating events.
化妆师，摄影师，后期设计，一个精良的团队。
The final product has received positive reviews from us and everyone around us.
I have already recommended my best friend to go back in time, and my friend has just seen the negative film, also feeling very happy.
I hope such工作室 will not be buried and more people will discover it，拍出属于自己的风格， rather than being consistent.
Thank you very much for the five-star review from Siao En En and Chien Ying Ying. They are both very innovative and creative young professionals, and we are an creative studio. We always strive to do our best, no matter what the customers prefer. Thank you for recognizing and celebrating our partnership.
Sweet and thoughtful assistants, lively and outgoing摄影师 teachers, every member of the team is super nice. It's a beautiful photography session, a unforgettable experience, and the results are much better than I imagined. Thank you all very much. 😘😘

"The restaurant staff have given me a call now."
A programming beginner who wants to share their personal experience.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you may choose to go for training, but if you don't have any such ideas, it's best to learn on your own. After all, training costs a lot of money, and you will need six months to learn everything.
However, if you plan to start in this industry, training is indeed an excellent choice. In particular, for those with weak self-control, training is even better.
If one's self-discipline is strong, they can also choose to learn on their own, but it will be more challenging.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a crucial thing.
First of all, it's important to consider the strength of the teaching staff at this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution has no value. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong teaching staff.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before making a choice. It's better to ask about students who have graduated from this institution, as only they can truly know whether the course offerings are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer this question because there is not enough information about your own situation. Learning something is closely related to your own situation because it depends on your individual needs and abilities.
For example, your profession, age, language of interest, and even the city where you want to work, all of these will have an impact on the field you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer major and have graduated, if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study. This is the lowest cost and most efficient way. Many online and offline training institutions are also excellent. However, the learning cost is high, and you need to invest a lot of time. It usually takes 3-6 months of focused training to master the skills.
However, if you are referring to the situations I mentioned earlier, self-study can be quite convenient. Many learning resources on the internet are now free, or you can find training resources on B站. If you don't know how to find resources, you can contact me through the introduction, obtain free resources, or get detailed advice.
There are also some classic books that can be integrated with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer science major, but you can afford to pay for some learning fees and time, it would be recommended to go to a training institution. This way, you will not have to work hard to learn, the teacher will explain everything in detail, and there will be someone to answer your questions. Additionally, it will also be helpful for learning planning or monitoring.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements and offer internal promotion spots, so that after studying, they can recommend the company to others, which can also save a lot of work in the interview stage after finding a job.
这就是我的一些看法，前面提到的内容由于不了解你的情况，所以只是大致介绍，并没有很详细地阐述。如果你还有其他问题需要咨询，随时都可以联系我进行沟通交流。
I said come before 1 pm, I saw it in the app.

My everyday work.
-符合您的要求，享受我的服务。
Carefully serve, carefully clean, keep beautiful.
In terms of the details you care about, F lumpong Homecare has helped you achieve "纯净" through my ability to serve my love for my family.
Keep the homes clean and build a corruption certificate for home cleaning service, providing a到位 service, and keeping the home clean.
Cleanliness inside and outside, this is my daily work.
Although水晶灯 are beautiful, they will soon become dull and obscure if not cleaned regularly. Just like our lives, this is true.
Only by doing it with heart can we succeed. We take pride in creating intricate details with meticulous attention to detail.
Give me the opportunity, and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because expertise is trustworthy. Your recognition is what I most encourage!
Currently, various fields are not easy to work in!
However, I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, stay committed, and work hard, I will be better than others. At least it's better than just sitting and抱怨！
The best part of a day starts with the morning, all good things begin in the morning. I hope you start this new day with joy, luck, health, and happiness. Keep a positive attitude throughout the whole day. Good morning!
When I was young, happiness was something you had, it was when you had it that you felt happy. As I grew older, happiness was a goal you wanted to achieve, and when you achieved it, you felt happy. After I became mature, I realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, and being able to understand it felt happy.
Be the most authentic and kind version of yourself, follow your heart and lead your life with no regret; one life path, lead your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mental health, look pretty and shining until the end of your life!
At every stage of life, there are different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it head-on.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by the difficulties; but if you persist in trying, the problem will ultimately be solved.
The Chinese and Saudi策展人来 together to host the first双年展 of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia -新华网
新华社利雅得12月12日电(记者王海洲 胡冠)沙特阿拉伯首届当代艺术双年展 — 迪里耶当代艺术双年展，于11日在位于沙特首都利雅得西北部的迪里耶JAX艺术区正式向公众开放，共有64位艺术家参展。
This双年展 was jointly策划 by the沙特迪里耶双年展基金会 and the United Creative Community's Earthq art center in Urbinati, China. The art director of the Earthq art center in Urbinati，田霏宇， served as the director of the双年展.
According to the exhibition management team, the theme of this trilateral exhibition is "摸着石头过河" which隐喻s the改革 strategies adopted during the period of social economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of the development of Saudi society and culture.
This year's biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six sections: "摸着石头过河", "的传承 as experimentation", "Frontier thinking", " towards the public", "The beautiful new world", and " On the spirit of art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than four成的of the total exhibition content, including painting, sculpture, and installation art in various forms; also, the works of 12 Chinese artists are of great interest, some of which use回收 materials in innovative ways to create their works, such as Xu Bing, who reconfigureds a classic Chinese landscape painting using discarded materials in the "背后的故事 series" (2014).
The CEO of the迪里耶双年展基金会，巴克利， expressed hope that the本届双年展 would establish international dialogue, allowing全球 audiences to learn about the蓬勃发展 cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen intercultural exchange.
The goal of the biennial event is的双重， it can engage in global dialogue with contemporary art from沙特阿拉伯 and also integrate Saudi audience into the world of contemporary art.
According to information provided, a series of lectures will also be held during the双年展 opening week, where意见领袖 in the art community，策展人， and artists will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange, the development of contemporary art.
I ordered a hammer.
The restaurant told me that the driver cannot bring the骨头.
I want to ask you for clarity about the reason.
The骨头 is okay, let the restaurant handle the transportation for me.
However, the system is not very convenient, and all the time it is used in another room.
I am at the #ADDRESS#分店 in Metaxin.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网
The Chinese People's Liberation Army media reported on December 12, 2021, that in order to continuously improve employment assistance for poverty-stricken population and strengthen and expand the results of poverty alleviation, the智慧的 State Council has recently出台相关政策 to promote rural revitalization and management of countryside public-private assistive jobs, which will help to comprehensively promote rural revitalization in the entire country.
According to a representative from the State Council of云南省， currently，云南 has developed 4,483 rural public-service jobs, which are used to安置脱贫劳动力 and other rural difficulties' employment, play an important role in helping the rural difficulties' groups to achieve employment growth, consolidate the results of rural revitalization, and effectively improve the capacity of rural public service.
This new policy was issued by seven departments, including the云南人社， rural revitalization, and finance, in a joint effort. Its main focus is on establishing a unified regulation for the scope of recruitment for rural公益性岗位 personnel at the basic level，资金管理， job development, and job management.
In terms of position development and setup, the new regulation clarify that positions are设置 according to the principles of "time-based positions, position-based personnel, dynamic management, and total control" "who develop, who use, and who is responsible" and "one person per position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
The recruitment process must follow steps such as announcement, declaration, evaluation，公示， hire, pre-employment training, and arrangement for employment.
In addition, the new regulation also defines the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural social welfare jobs, the production standards and benefits systems for rural social welfare jobs, and规定 that each rural social welfare job development department should purchase意外伤害商业保险 for employees; it also requires relevant departments to regularly monitor the distribution of rural social welfare job benefits.

Hello!
Can I cancel the order?
I place a new order.
Has it been取消了？
二、Although the right has had successful periods in history, they are short in length. This is because if they get a little sunshine, they are bright; if they drink hot water, they get hot. Once they get a little success, they look for more and more, but when they are遭受打击， they have no where to turn.
However，实事求是地说， the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive aspects of the rightist tendency should not be underestimated, including the结束 Cultural Revolution to define the truth standard, developing the economy to improve technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
Three, for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his words and also respect him as he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but it must always lead to social instability, damage the people's lives, and result in a confused and diverse political landscape, with various political groups参差不齐. Moreover, foreign interference can occur at this time.
四个方面，改变或改善中国需要有耐心和对国家人民负责的态度。政治投机分子 who attempt to win at the expense of others are not右派， they are的儿子们。
Let's talk about the left again.
The left, actually, are a group of children of a time and a political era.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some rightist statements and analyze their ideas when needed. Then, the left will not be so fortunate, because what the left wants is the trash that the Communist Party has discarded!
五个字的英文翻译是：  第五个字的英文翻译是：  I think it's completely unnecessary.
It is not necessary to try to argue with collaborators and right-wingers. They are all thick-headed and have no room for reason.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and even less think of making the rogues and left-wingers acknowledge it. Why should we do that?
I told my friends like this: When the anti- Guys call you a five-percenter, when the leftie call you a rightie dog, it恰恰 proves that our this middle path is correct!
Many people had idealism in their youth, but as they grew older, they forgot about their ideals or tried to pursue them, but became obsessed with them.
渐行渐远 towards the ideal, even the youth who killed the dragon eventually became a dragon.
I think "left" and "right" generally refer to constraints and freedom. The inherent historical and cultural genes of China suggest that the overall direction of China should be towards the left.
The domestic right-wing promotes freedom and emphasizes efficiency and development; the left-wing加强 supervision and values fairness and security more heavily.
The overall society now wants to focus more on fairness, while China and the United States are competing, it is certain that there will be a bias towards the left, and it is expected to continue for many years.
Although you may not understand it, just leave a like.
There's nothing to say here，花花 is just so rude.
In the past two years, the封锁 and occlusion of American chips on Huawei not only put Huawei into an unprecedented situation but also caused significant losses to "American-style" enterprises.
The US supports China's semiconductor industry by requiring its own enterprises and those of its allies to simultaneously封锁 China's semiconductor industry. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers are affected, causing the research and development investment of semiconductor manufacturers to reduce and production capacity to decrease. This has resulted in disruptions to the global semiconductor supply chain.
Nowadays, the "short supply of chips" has affected many major industries around the world, such as automotive manufacturers reducing production and mobile phone prices increasing. Almost all industries that use chips are affected by this problem.
In order to gain control over the "chip"自主权， more and more technological giants in many countries are starting to take the "de美化" path.
In order to tightly control the global semiconductor industry and牵制 China's semiconductor development, the United States has been making frequent moves recently. It has hosted "Semiconductor Summits" and邀请 64 countries' major leaders to form a semiconductor alliance. Additionally, it has contributed funds to support American本土科技巨头 such as Intel, which seeks to regain its dominant position in the semiconductor industry by constructing two semiconductor manufacturing plants in Arizona, valued at 200 billion US dollars, and opening up its manufacturing services to the public.
When most people thought that Intel's move would cause a certain impact on TSMC and potentially steal TSMC's "market share."
之所以这么肯定，是因为，英特尔作为美国的老牌科技巨头，在半导体领域已经深耕几十年，拥有大量的人才队伍和技术储备，必定能在短期内迅速崛起，打败台积电。
However, when it comes to Intel's decision, Zhang Zhong界面 of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) seems to be dismissive.
At the "2021 World Master智库 Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhong萌芽说，With regards to Intel's decision to build a chip manufacturing plant, Zhang Zhong without hesitation said: "It's quite ironic that Intel is building a chip manufacturing factory."
Zhang Zhong谋 is why he is so unconvinced about Intel's move into the chiplet field, because he still holds a grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Intel 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the jewel in American manufacturing, standing at the highest point globally and being the霸主 in the world's semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's top-tier semiconductor chips were still largely controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the半导体 industry was characterized by IDM (In-Data-Making) mode, where the chip was produced by one factory from design to packaging. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model has put small enterprises under too much pressure, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are unable to overcome the巨额生产线建设 costs.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to develop分工 and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhong谋 heard about a company specializing in chip design and thought that since there was a company专门做设计的， it would be necessary to establish a factory specifically for semiconductor manufacturing.
relatively soon, Zhang Zhong谋's ideas became reality, and Tsinghua University Electronic Science and Technology Co., Ltd. was formed.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has focused its main business on the single环节 of "和组织制造", providing代加工服务 without design.
When台积电 was just starting up, it was a minor player in the face of Intel, the giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongwen once sought investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) only operates in the manufacturing phase of the chip industry, it seemed to be highly arrogant and看不起 TSMC, and quickly rejected the investment opportunity.
Zhang Zhong谋 also believed that Intel at that time didn't value the semiconductor manufacturing services.
It was unexpected that the giant that once看不起 gatekeeping services for semiconductor manufacturing today also started to do so.
Therefore, Zhang Zhong谋 thinks that Intel's entry into integrated circuit manufacturing is somewhat ironic.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)'s market value has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of Samsung's aggressive invasion, Intel is naturally not afraid to stay static.
Today, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still停留在 14nm, which was introduced seven years ago.
It is not that easy to catch up.
I'm not waiting any longer.
It's been 2 hours since making the order.
Today, let's watch some 【奇怪的热搜】.
What is a normal public opinion?
Randomly choose three top news topics: February 2nd Dragon rises, Joyful友的价格上涨， and Car pooling incident. The public sentiment spreads and forms waves, then an exponential decrease ( smooth curve) ultimately resolves. If secondary舆情 occurs, small驼峰s may also appear again.
They appear to be the same as the 【network public opinion evolution model】 that was displayed on the Weibo official website before.
What is an unusual public opinion?
randomly select six high-ranking news items from the same event，呈现出 【孤峰状】、 【锯齿状】、 【断崖状】.
The English translation for the sentence is:  "The shape of the孤峰状 is where people intentionally warm up, quickly climbing the top of the list and drawing attention from the public. The shape of the锯齿状 is where people repeatedly warm up, ensuring that the topic stays on the top of the list. And the shape of the断崖状 is where a集体撤离 occurs, after the topic has fulfilled its function and is no longer relevant, and people move on to new tasks and destinations."
In Figure 9, the peak of the的热度 of one event is exactly the valley of another event, with no difference in time at all. It is certain that a unified group of water agents will receive the mission and start a new round of attack.
The professionalism of black PR is nothing short of impressive: over a hundred trending topics are simultaneously listed, with which topics attract attention, which ones provide科普， which ones create arguments, which ones转移 the attention, which ones influence perception, which ones误导 judgments, which ones煽动 emotions, and which ones guide decision-making. Black-产党的帐户分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到了舆情传播扩散中所有要素。
Communication is a science, and regardless of all subjective factors such as立场， emotions, and bias，客观数据 will still reveal the truth about black marketing.
Everything that passes by will leave a trace, and we will dig together to uncover these traces.

The first cases of感染 Omicron variant of the virus have been reported in countries like Mauritania. -新华网
According to reports from Our World in News, dated December 12th, Marspury, Cyprus, and马拉维 have recently reported the detection of cases of the novel coronavirus变异株 Omicron in the first time.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of Covid-19 caused by the Omicron strain on十月 first.
According to the Minister of Health in Huawei，凯莱什·贾古特帕尔， one of the patients was a tourist who arrived in Huawei from南非 on November 27th; another patient is a local resident of Huawei who reported being positive for COVID-19 after engaging in contact with an individual who had recently visited南非 and returned home.
After being treated at the hospital, both of the infected individuals have had their test results turned negative and have now returned to their respective homes.
The塞浦路斯 Ministry of Health announced on October 10 that it had diagnosed the first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant in the country.
These three people are students who returned from foreign travel this月初. Since they are all轻微症状， they did not require hospitalization.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government of the country has been gradually increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year，旅客 who入境塞舌尔 by plane aged 12 or above will need to pay for a private blood test at the airport after arrival.
The Ministry of Health of塞内加尔 also announced on October 10th that it would start接种pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
On September 9th, the Health Minister Qinbize Chi蓬da said that they had found the first three cases of the Omicron strain of COVID-19 in马拉维.
The health department of the country conducted genomic sequencing of 12 PCR-positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and discovered three cases of infection.

Thinking about calling a restaurant early so that I can eat earlier, but I'm still not there yet even though it's already 7 pm.
I don't understand what you're saying...
Are your Chinese words translated into English? Or do you prefer using English?
"那发送到" is a phrase that cannot be translated directly into English. It is a Chinese idiom that means "that which is sent" or "the thing sent." It is often used to refer to something sent by someone or something that has been sent. For example, if someone says "那发送到请回复，" they are indicating that they want the recipient to respond to the message with a message like "请回复，" which means "Please respond."
Will you call him and tell him this?

"收到是金钱肚" translates to " receives is a money belly" in English.

Do I need to remain in the conversation?
I called and explained my situation to your staff.
Your drivers told me that the address is too far.
"大美360集成家装"
Address: 12th floor, Happy Home Building, Station Road No. 156
At first, it was recommended by a friend because of my trust, so I chose to have a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
Upon entering the store, began a series of phishing scams.
I arrived at the store the first time only to show them my room plans, but they did not physically measure the house. They were able to give me an estimate for the price of my 135-square-foot room at 7,000 dollars, despite not having done so. They took a rough look at their materials and didn't even know what brand they were.
Their second trick is to drag you to the store and demand you pay the advance (and once you do, you cannot refund the money because you will never be able to return it，除非你 have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would邀请 their so-called manager to come and tell you how much discount we could give you if you just pay the deposit today.
This is a big trap, and I am a鲜活的例子 of being被骗. I paid over one thousand dollars in advance, when I was so冲动ed.
His quote came with many issues. 7,000 does not include water and electricity改造， nor does it include any doors or cabinets, and these three are the main costs for foundation work.
In addition to these, their service points charge higher fees than other companies.
I have lost confidence in this company, and they started off by not making it clear what was required to sign a contract.
When I went to request a refund, they appeared to be experienced and had a dedicated team assigned to handle you.
No matter how, I will咬死 that it is the customer's problem and they are completely responsible.
There are various excuses for responsibility, and there are many details to discuss. I don't want to discuss them all in tears, so please don't choose them. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they decorated with them also had poor quality and they are calculating all the costs for you in the future.
“坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。”  "De不起，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又破产了又改成其他的。"
Therefore, everyone should avoid choosing such a greedy construction company.
In the future, everyone should take advantage of Baidu to look at these and ask for these consulting services because interior design is not a small cost.
If you want to ask a question to the vendor, please log in or register first.
There is no allowed to publish various types of business reviews, and for more detail information, please refer to the business enrollment declaration.
The Dongzhou Construction Design Channel of Dianping provides you with the latest business information such as address, phone, and working hours of various merchants. Look for construction companies and construction agencies, and visit Dianping.
So terrifying! If you don't cancel your order within 30 minutes, please do so!
难道没有其他方法了吗？比如，换个地址？
Okay, don't cancel the conversation otherwise if the payment is not returned within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel after 15 minutes不到.
The soup dumpling should be cooked, but I received raw meat, so I can't eat it.
Starry Night约 |georgia conjunction on April 14th bring the maximum conjunction-新华社.
The news source in Tianjin, China, reported that, as the last major流星雨 of the year in the northern hemisphere, the双子座流星雨， one of the three major流星雨s in the northern part of the continent, will experience its maximum magnitude on December 14th. Viewers who are interested can observe it in the late afternoon and evening of the same day.
The Chinese translation for this sentence is:  A Beijing天文爱好者， An Qian, captured the双子座流星雨 on December 13, 2018, in Qinghai.
Most流星雨母天体 are周期彗星， but the母天体 of the双子座流星雨 is 福塞同 (F巨石阵), which is a Apollo-type小行星.
The双子座流星雨 is also the second known流星雨 that is not孕育ed by comets.
As the New Year's大片，修立鹏 pointed out that, like the New Year's Eve special, the双子座流星雨 usually occurs in the end of the year, and the "release date" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This流星雨 is known for its large流量 and stability, and is together with the 流星雨 of the阻塞式彗星 (Ooty) and the仙后座流星雨 (Pillars of Fire) as the three largest流星雨 in the Northern Hemisphere.
One显著 characteristic of the双子座流星雨 is its slow speed, rich colors, and many fire流星. It is suitable for beginners both in visual shooting and天文 photography.
The English translation for the sentence is:  The双子座流星雨 was captured by a天文 enthusiasts named Yang Jing in蓟县 on December 13, 2020.
Astrology predictions indicate that this year's双子座流星雨 will occur around 15th of December at around 15:00 local time, and at its maximum intensity, the ZHR will be around 150 (the number of meteors seen per hour when the meteor point is directly above the head).
The recommended指数 chart for the双子座流星雨.
Last year, the。「落花缤纷」Gemini流星雨 left a deep impression on people. However, this year's。「双子座」流星雨 will be affected by moonlight, and the highlights will be limited.
The date of February 14th is the 11th of lunar November in the lunar calendar. The moon's phases will cause interference during observation, but Fortunately, it will be after midnight when the moon will fall down. At this time, the radiation point of the双子座流星雨 will also rise higher.
Those who like流星雨 can observe them during the hours when the moon sets later in the night, but please be careful not to get cold.
How can one maximize the number of meteors observed?
It's not recommended to conduct observation in a city. You can select a high-altitude, less-照亮ed, open-field view with a东北-oriented view in the suburbs or countryside，耐心地 wait for the moon to fall, and then observe visually after that.
It is important to note that the双子座流星雨 has a large流量 in all directions, so you don't need to look directly at the流星雨流星雨 spot to observe it.
If your friend loves photography and wants to capture stunning "流星雨大片", it is best to choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens. Use high ISO and maximum aperture during the shooting.
From the perspective of stability and durability, a tripod, spare battery, and release cable are also indispensable.
Zhen Li鹏 reminded him.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
Based on my understanding, the traditional TV that题主 refers to should be defined as液晶显示屏. The differences between LCD and LED LCD in market positioning are mainly two points:
First, laser television is more focused on large-screen markets.
Compared to the market positioning of large-screen液晶显示屏 all-out adoption, laser电视 clearly focuses more on the large-screen market, or可以说， laser电视 is a product born for large-screen markets.
Currently, the mainstream flat screen televisions range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TVs are usually over 75 inches and the largest ones exceed 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen智能电视.
In recent years, laser TVs' output and sales volume have been increasing globally, and they account for more than six成 of total TV sales above 80 inches.
According to China Ionity Consulting's prediction, in 2020, the market sales of laser televisions will surpass 140%，继续保持 rapid growth.
The reason for such a good performance in the big screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser displays in protecting the eyes.
Based on the成像 principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted from the laser source does not directly enter the eye. Compared to the backlight of液晶显示器， the成像 process is closer to the成像 process of objects under natural conditions, and the impact on the eyes is smaller.
The Chinese Electronic Technology Standardization Institute's赛西实验室 and北京协和医院眼科专家 conducted a rigorous comparative experiment of laser TV and液晶 TV观看 under the same conditions among the population, resulting in 144 test groups。
Data supports that laser TVs indeed have strong的眼睛保护 properties, and in some aspects, they even have a certain improvement effect.
With视力健康 becoming increasingly important, laser TV not only attracts more users due to its eye-saving advantages, but also finds another breakthrough in the television market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Unlike the continuous decline in flat panel TV prices, the prices of available laser电视 currently range from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, and the prices are gradually rising as the size and light source are upgraded.
What makes laser TV so expensive?
There must be something reason behind it.
With the continuous development of lighting and technology, laser TV has many advantages that液晶 monitors and projection systems cannot achieve.
Using ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TVs have a shorter projection distance compared to traditional projection devices, allowing for a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance without requiring a lot of space. Moreover, the主机 is compact and占用地方 is small.
In terms of brightness, major brands of laser television can reach more than 2000 lm.
In addition to having lower heat output, it also has a smaller equipment loss and can have a longer service life for the TV.
除了这些， many high-end Laser电视机 models also equipped with advanced technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition content, artificial intelligence systems, and bioinspired screens, providing users with a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It is not a伪需求， but a result of the demand细分. When it comes to picture quality and cost-performance ratio, laser televisions are not suitable for audio and video enthusiasts. If you want to balance large screens and limited viewing environments, you can try it. Everything has pros and cons, and you should make your own judgment after considering the factors. However, it is important to avoid relying on one's words.
Simply, ultra-widewide close-up投影机- Laser TV have to use expensive ultra-widewide lenses and mirrors to come close to the screen, which is not optimal for optical design.
In order to block some of the environmental light, we use a micro structure Fizeau screen. The cost is high, and the price of an 80-inch screen is essentially enough to replace a 65-inch液晶 display.
Another thing, I especially dislike how投影 manufacturers highlight the benefits of diffuse light as being good for the eyes. Please, the light that can be seen on the screen is already direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse it to the天花板， the eyes will not see it. If you非要和时间作斗争，那么液晶液晶电视的 diffuse "direct" light will also be照亮了天花板。
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a diffuse reflection, it cannot form an image.
恰恰被忽略了高增益幕布的热斑(光斑)效应，当大量光线从某一角度反射到眼睛时，那才真正难受。

After adding WeChat for预约， the girl's sister sends me the available schedule time, and my response is relatively timely~
Before visiting the store, I looked at the拍摄艺术作品. The more, the merrier! The outdoor婚纱 were拍摄 very beautiful, and there were many different拍摄 styles involved.
Upon arriving that day, I briefly expressed my thoughts to the young woman and she showed me very patiently how to try on two styles of clothes that I was dilemma about. Finally, we decided to start makeup and styling~ The photographer will set up some props and guide the movements before taking the photo, and they are also very detail-oriented.
However, it may be because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, so the resulting photos aren't the style I'm looking for. However, they should still be beautiful 🙊🙊.
After the photography is done, photographers will help choose photos and discuss post-processing styles, which feels quite careful.
The edited film will take about a半个月， please enjoy the results~
The English translation for the sentence is: "We won the second photo event of the写真-style feast – we can choose any clothing from the entire room for拍摄."
Finally, I decided to choose a black lace dress to experience different styles.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer responsible for the shooting is a younger brother who is in his 90s. Although he is slightly青涩， he hopes to provide more suggestions for customers in terms of camera movement guidance in the future. He is very talkative and the shooting process was quite enjoyable.
"Wen摄视觉美学摄影馆优选品质店" translates to "Wen摄 Visual Art Photography Studio Select Quality Store" in English.
On the homepage, take a look at Queenie too~
At the store, you fill in your name and phone number, then choose clothing. You can choose a wedding dress, and you change into three or four different outfits. After you make your selection, you take a long time to apply makeup, and the customer service is also good. During the later拍摄， they will teach you how to pose for the photos. However, the photos taken by the camera have a big face, and it is said that the editing will take about a半个月， and the final version is sent out several days later, and it seems that there is not much difference from the original photo.
The overall environment is relatively good.
There are a lot of available clothing.
There are about three makeup positions, one of which is a photography studio.
The service is very的热情 and very detail-oriented.
The hair dresser is quite patient.
The photographers will also be very serious to teach you the movements.
If the client is not satisfied, the photographer will also主动提出 additional shots.
The experience may be a bit too extreme, as the original double-眼皮 is now being贴出了 triple-眼皮.
The eye brow line is also removed, which is a bit awkward for people who don't画 eyeliner on a daily basis.
The photos were given for ten days, but the Photoshop effect is not very satisfied, and it still feels like the filters and眼皮贴 are still very obvious.
Due to not being very sure what style I want, I tried two sets of clothes. After exploring and selecting, I finally chose a black dress. The sister-in-law said this set is more like H本能本能的一下想到了古驰(Gucci)。Gucci是一家著名的时尚奢侈品牌，以其独特、时尚、奢华的设计风格和面料而闻名。
After choosing the clothes, we started with styling. The发型师 and the makeup artist sister were very patient and helped me out. The final result was very satisfied.
After applying makeup and hair, the photographer had me move around to take pictures. The process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After completing the shoot, the young man carefully selected four of his favorite photos for fine editing. He said that the final results were very satisfying and within the 15-item limit.
There have been no replies for 3 days... due to your system not recognizing my credit card, I am unable to join the monthly fee plan #PRS_ORG#!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for all my payments.
I now need to pay the shipping fee every time.
Could you please let me off with a discount until you complete your investigation and charge me for my monthly fee afterwards?
Is  Xiao Yu Ying's insurance plan reliable?
Little雨伞 is an online insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of conditions: According to the "保险经纪机构监管规定(2015年修订)"提示， becoming a insurance brokerage company requires three keywords：股东 and founders have no significant criminal records in the past three years, a minimum limit of 1.5 billion yuan, and must be approved by the Chinese Central Bureau of Statistics.
These three are actually quite harsh. In summary, they require strength, approval from the State Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance and banking within a national scope), good business practices from shareholders, and Little雨伞 Insurance, as a insurance broker, does not need to worry too much about whether Little雨伞 Insurance is legitimate. After all, there are these three requirements, and no insurance company can meet them.
At this point, it's still quite good, and it's reliable.
From the perspective of保险 products, Little雨伞 is just an insurance supermarket, where many companies' outstanding comprehensive insurance policies are available on this platform, such as the latest addition, Thai Super玛丽 5, where both the claim and acceptance parties are Thai人寿保险公司. Little雨伞保险 is just a third-party intermediary, so you don't need to doubt its credibility.
Looking at the payment model: Internet platforms' products, as they reduce the costs of operating stores and sales personnel, generally have a higher value-for-value ratio. Moreover, their payment methods are flexible and support monthly payments, thereby alleviateing the payment pressure on borrowers and maximizing the leverage effect of insurance.
This is still quite excellent.
You can consider that.
From the perspective of业务员 professionalism: this is particularly important because insurance is a very professional industry. Many internet products allow customers to self-drive for insurance coverage, which can lead to many misconceptions. In the area of health information and occupation, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective elements when taking the insurance policy，认为自己 healthy or eligible, which can lead to many理赔 hazards and the risk of being denied coverage.
I have actually worked as a phone保险 sales representative for "Tencent Wealthcare" (likewise, an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I would be very responsible to share this information with you.
Internet insurance is true and reliable, but the people are unreliable. There are no professional staff in the Internet channels, and there are also many sales misleading.
For example: A insurance policy that costs just 1 yuan covers 6 million dollars, and a phone is included with the insurance policy, but customers cannot claim a free delivery of a 6 million-dollar health insurance policy. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are avoiding the truth by not providing clear information to customers. For the first month, customers are charged 1 yuan, but in the second month, they will need to pay regular charges, ranging from几十 to 200 dollars, so many customers are not sure what they are getting themselves into after paying for several years.
Thinking that one dollar would cover it, the insurance company paid out six million (a catch from heaven).
We will give you a mobile phone for free, only if the final digits of the contract, such as 6666 or 8888, belong to a special contract segment. And if the winning SMS is sent, you won't be able to exchange it without someone reminding you, and there will be no notification.
(This is again a trap for the applicant) You can get a free 6-month health insurance coverage with a plan that provides a maximum of 60,000 yuan in coverage. However, if you only rely on this plan and have no other的商业 insurance, if you actually experience a serious health problem, how will 60,000 yuan solve the problem? You will be left with nothing and your future life will be裸奔.
Currently, the country is also actively against misleading Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, on a综合 view, the platform is not in issue, and the products are also not in issue. What is in issue is the professionalism and integrity of the salesperson.
I suggest that you carefully consider the whole matter. In fact, many offline insurance agencies offer wider range of products, more opportunities for clients to choose from, and some products have better value-added services than online products.
I have helped 59 Internet clients, underwriting offline products, and saved 2,000-3,000 yuan/year for each one.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange views with me.
I am a保险经纪 at Mingya, with 3 years of experience in corporate governance training, serving over 900 corporate users and collaborating with over 100保险公司. Before providing insurance products to clients, I will take into account their client needs and tailor insurance solutions. During the insurance process, I will compare multiple options and strive to get the best insurance rating for my clients. After the insurance is obtained, I will handle the保单整理 and handle the delivery of the policy to ensure that clients have peace of mind and are not worried about any issues.
Growing together with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be of help to you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, internet insurance is the insurance business in which the applicant can complete all the payment process on their own after clicking on the insurance enrollment link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, and the insurance counselor does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the applicant on their own.
Although online insurance claims do not lack the "仪式化" nature, or even have a printout of the physical contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal weight of the electronic contract.
This这种模式 is somewhat similar to the mass-produced process of call center, but there is a致命的 problem with buying insurance：后续的服务 may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract with a few decades of duration. Should we really give a thought when purchasing insurance to whether the "agent" we choose is someone who will be with us for a long time and provide us services after many years?
How can I get in touch with the delivery specialist?
It's almost three o'clock.
Is that meant for me to receive compensation?
I said I wanted to deliver things by敲响的门
But the biker just left it at the door, then went away.
The English translation for this sentence is: "It's still sent wrong."
Your driver has picked up my delivery from #NUMBER#, but I have still been informed that I am currently waiting.
The delivery driver has received my delivery order at 19:25, but still refused to leave.
After I buy everything, do you need any other delivery services?
What should I do?
Where have your drivers gone?
Are you still needed to wait?
"I am going to send the order."
Okay, if you don't cancel, I will call the police.
But my food may have safety and health issues.

It's enough to issue a revised discount code.
No problem, remember you don't need to arrange a second delivery. I have already bought something else, so I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
Since old times to this day, I stand against any form of fraud and abuse, and even more against physical attacks on those individuals.
In a civilized society, we can包容 all things, but it is necessary to eliminate this rogue.
If one does not look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this impolite behavior.
From your initial Facebook request for a friend request, followed by humorous posts, and then your attempt to post my home address and my father's name on social media, I have一律采取了不回应的态度.
After that, you not only continued to tag me with daily six meals, but also continued to discuss me in explicit and derogatory terms on Facebook with your所谓的 friends, including comments about my appearance，身材， fertility, and even messages about planting seeds and whether or not to插 them. I...I guess I can't help but feel grateful.
How did I know later on, I even received several friends sending me information about your Facebook friend's profile, including a picture of you and sexual harassment-like comments.
I'm sorry, as a female, I can no longer continue to be silent.
After the news of my报警 was uploaded, you did not show any signs of收敛， and instead became more disrespectful.
regardless of your political background or your social status, in our society, respect for both genders is essential.
Yes, you can continue with this humorous, indirect，羞辱， and derogatory language, and you can continue to claim that you only care about and affection me. You can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it was not made by you or continue to publish any攻击性 comments.
Yes, indeed, I cannot and do not have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, nor do I want to know you. I don't need your opinions on my appearance and身材.
I don't even think there is any girl who would willing to let others羞辱 her in order to gain fame.
My friend asked me, is everything okay?
If I say "good," you will not believe.
I don't think there is any girl who can say she is still okay after being霸凌 like this.
In any field of work, society, politics, or business, only people with basic moral principles will choose to harm any female in such a way.
I believe that justice lies within people's hearts.
I took some comments and compiled them for everyone to see.
There should be no one else can pretend to be you from your own post.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
A heart-warming smile.
越南 People's日报网 -越南总理范明正出席第三次越南国家数字技术企业发展论坛

Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation is serving the whole population, therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the whole population's participation.
The people and enterprises are the core，主体， goal and drive of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and the enterprises.
Prime Minister 范明正 emphasizes that digital transformation requires to reflect the national spirit, which requires internal forces, strategic, long-term, and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation requires driving long-term development and sustainable development. It should participate in the epidemic prevention and control, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of resource exhaustion, and support the green transformation and the development of green energy.
数字化转型 requires participation in the work of building databases related to the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national cultural and biological characteristics, and other fields, and to promote digital transformation in fields such as banking, tax, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The main goal of digital transformation is to make people more happy and the country more prosperous and development.
Prime Minister 范明正 demands that各级政府，各级别机构， and enterprises increase their leadership, guidance, and understanding of digital transformation in their development of digital technologies. They should continue to develop and improve the institutional framework related to digital transformation. To strengthen national governance, they should promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, active, and proactive.
During the forum，总理范明正 attended the ceremony for the 2021 Excellent Digital Products Award for越南制造 and the opening ceremony of the "越南制造" Digital Product Exhibition.
I have reported and attached the image, but no response has been received.
What are you talking about, no matter how hard I try, there are no potatoes in my bag.
It's "sour soup chicken, raw meat."
There's no way to eat.
Are you sure that the food you cooked is fresh, rather than old?
"un unacceptable"
I ordered earlier.
The sentence is "说是 7点多送到" and the English translation is "It is said to be delivered at 7:00 p.m."
Why need to re-make something?
It's quite absurd.

During the Black Friday event, go to the "H斯顿" filter store and check out the filter. The store is currently having a promotion and the prices are quite affordable.
The Amusement Park is a total of 11 levels. From Level 2 to Level 9, there are parking areas at both levels 1 and 2. Parking is free during the day!
The surrounding area is not very good, there are few hotel hardware stores, and the hotel taste is average.
This elevator is also very frustrating. It's like having a bad illness. From the second floor to the first floor, it keeps going back and forth, never stopping at the one I pressed. Then, I had to go down through the safety通道 to the ground floor, which is even more frustrating because it leads directly to an furniture store where the store closed and the safety通道 cannot be accessed!
"We still need to improve, and many places have not been developed."
Address: No. 555北一路沙依巴克区， there is a convenient route and a large parking lot, and it is still free in the daytime.

It's a great place to buy products, and if you're tired, you can rest on the sofa.
I recently wanted to buy a comfortable sofa, and my friend told me there are many sofas to choose from. I have seen Great Wall家具 and M&M Home, and I think they are both good options, but the prices are slightly higher, so I am still犹豫不决.

Three US jets are gathered near China's border, and one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's inventory has recently visited island of Hawaii, reports多维 - January 17, 2022. A recent卫星 image shows the US three jets gathered near China's border, and the US media has also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's inventory has recently visited Hawaii，释放出 important信号 for US allies and enemies in the IDIAS (Inter-American Development Interface) region.
According to the Chinese think tank "南海战略态势感知平台", on January 9, a satellite found the United States Navy carrier, USS Carl Vinson, near the Paracel海峡.
The巴拉巴克海峡 connects the South China Sea with the Sumed Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
This platform is expected to send the "Carl's Jr." class to deployment in the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the航母 "Carl森" with F-35C战斗机 and CMV-22 "恢复鱼鹰" seaplane tenders.
There are two美军航母 currently operating in the Pacific Ocean. One is the USS Carl Vinson, which arrived in the region on January 3rd, and the other is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which left美国 on January 3rd.
"林肯"号 also首次搭载了F-35C Joint Strike Fighter ( Strike Fighter)中队， which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squad of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, the United States Navy has a third aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is泊位在日本横须贺。
The航母 combat group also includes the导弹巡洋舰 "尚普兰湖" and the导弹驱逐舰 "石勒苏益格-贾格尔".
Three U.S. Navy船只 gather near China's borders, with the largest weapons on board，罕见访问关岛. On January 17, 2022, the "南海战略态势感知平台" released the latest satellite images, showing three U.S. Navy ships gathering near China's borders.

"Also, according to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the美国海军's inventory, recently visited Guangzhou Island, which is a rare trip for the military force."
On Saturday (15 January), the Ohio-class潜艇 USS Nevada entered the海军基地 in Hawaii.
Three US Navy ships gather near China, with the largest weapons on board, an exceptional visit to Hawaii. Analysis suggests that this is a message to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first official visit by a United States Strategic弹道导弹潜艇 to Hong Kong since 2016, and also the second public visit to Hong Kong since the 1980s.
Three aircraft carriers of the United States are gathered near China's周边， and the most powerful weapons have recently访问ed islands in the South China Sea. China has been constructing a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
Here is the image of China's Anshun Island, located in the South China Sea.
In a statement, the美国海军 said that the visit by the Ohio-class潜艇 "内华达州号" to夏威夷 Island of夏威夷 during this year's visit enhanced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continuous commitment to the security and stability of the Itar斑 region, including the Pacific Ocean.
Submarines equipped withballistic missile technology are usually called "Boomer submarine".
The itinerary of 14 " thunderbolt潜艇" of the US Navy fleet is usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding strategic weapons潜艇s makes the " thunderbird潜艇" the "中最重要的生存武器" in the "核三位一体" system, which also includes strategic weapons launched from the United States本土， such as launch sites for strategic weapons, as well as B-2 and B-52 strategic weapon轰炸机s that can carry nuclear weapons.
When discussing with a friend the recent decline of Meta by 26%, the市值蒸发 of 2,510亿美元， Zuckerberg responded that "we are facing unprecedented competition." What does that mean?
Meta (的原称 Facebook) is essentially a advertising company, with its main source of income coming from advertising. As for today, this advertising company is making money and has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., regardless of their功能定位， are all traffic channels for Meta.
Moreover, Meta is also the largest "ad exchange", many apps 外接 Meta's ads, and monetization is achieved through the Meta's ad platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information again, which affects the efficiency of ad display.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it clearly prompts users whether they allow an app to access their personal information. For most people, their normal response would be definitely not.
If Google does not act soon, the impact on the revenue of Meta will be even greater in the following days.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in the收入增长 of Meta has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is not sure and may not be high, but it is still present).
Everyone knows that Meta (Facebook) does not have a business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of the revenue of Meta is贡献给中国， mainly from companies in China engaged in sea business.
Meta has about a hundreds of employees in its office in Hong Kong, and there are also several major代理商 in mainland China.
If Chinese companies want to expand their overseas market, Meta is always the indispensable advertising channel, and the money spent on it largely goes to Meta.
It's interesting to note thatTT is now one of the main competitors of Meta, but two years ago, Meta made a lot of money from字节.
All domestic agents are helping字节跳动 place ads on Meta. The performance of Meta in the China region is also very good.
I haven't specifically studied about it recently, but it won't be any better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies investing heavily overseas and burning money has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not顺利.
Facebook is becoming increasingly old, and new platforms, including TT, are not under Meta's control.
The main problem is not only a decline in income, but also a lack of growth expectations.
Capital market is not only concerned with income, but also important to consider the expectations of the future.
Clearly, the expected outcome of Meta is not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about "Metaverse."
Certainly, the metaverse is one of the directions that should be considered for the future. However, the implementation of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to支撑 Meta's market value in the next few years.
Therefore, the next two years should be relatively difficult for Meta.
Although Facebook is now very popular, it still has a revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion per year. In fact, Facebook is now very worried, and与其他互联网企业和高科技公司相比， there is nothing good to protect against the risk.
Although his several social media apps currently have high daily active users and are major social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid growth of TikTok, Facebook doesn't have any confidence. The颠覆 between these two is just a blink of an eye.
Building a metaverse, which is an可望而不可及 concept, has no hope of success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg is constantly changing the name of the company and searching for new routes. However, I think his route choices are wrong and lead him to a dead-end.  This is my some thoughts, and it is for reference only.
