"My surgeon flipped his shit and was like " fine! ""
But you're going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don't know another one that's gonna help this poor kid.  However, it's important to note that this is a very aggressive and offensive way to express oneself, and it's not appropriate to use language like this towards others. It's also important to remember that everyone has the right to their own opinions and to express them respectfully, but it's also important to respect the opinions of others.
course, they don't
And this kid is screwed.

As it turns out, this procedure is generally disliked by insurance because it is rather expensive.

"Makeshift Munster beats Wasps in Champions Cup cracker"
Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup match, contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.  Note: "Overran" is not a commonly used Russian word for "beat." A more common translation might be "beating down" or "overtaking."

And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 players were on the ropes, and Munster reacting by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.  "And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 players were on the ropes, and Munster reacting by engineering tries for debutants Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway."
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display, topped off by a captivating try, had given Wasps hope, but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.  注意：本句中的“Alfie Barbeary”和“ Campbell”是两个人名，需要根据上下文进行确定。
misses 17 players due to injury and had to deal with the loss of four more players to Covid in the morning, resulting in a quick reconfiguration of the team.
" meanwhile, Munster were missing 34 squad personnel due to quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench."
crucially, however, Ireland's stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to strengthen their ranks.
For all the absentees, it was a enjoyable spectacle, where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster demonstrated the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear.
Wasps' Covid- affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle.  "Wasps' Covid- affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle"  In Russian, this sentence can be translated as: "Wasps' affected by Covid start of the day was multiply reinforced when the game began, with Thomas Young being denied a certain goal by O'Mahony's outstanding covering tackle."
And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.  Translation in  Russian: && while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.
However, their scrum gave the game a foothold, and it required intense defense to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first turnover in quick succession.
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees, and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.  " Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees. Their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with the referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck."
Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post, and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary.  Note: The original sentence is a play on words, with " directed" and " directed" being replaced by " directed" and " directed" in the Russian translation. This is a common technique used in language translation to preserve the integrity of the original text.
It concluded a exhilarating spell of end-to-end rugby in which the rivals took turns to attack from deep, and, having been at the heart of the home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow.
A kind bounce off Murray's kick caused Earls to score the easiest of tries, as Munster hit back and then Frost left for the sin-bin, reducing the home side to 13.
Здравствуйте, двевеве良い回復は短い時間で优势の人員を感じました。 Beirneは一人の破り出しを開始し、 Campbellの中の全長で绝大な結果を生みました。
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.  Here's the Russian translation:  And in the 49th minute, Munster were out of sight, when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.
Hooker Scott Buckley, match-winner on his Munster debut, followed a lineout move with the next over and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score.

Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.
技术发展已经被 currently completed 完成，预计 commercialization 需要一段时间。
POSTECH announced on September 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes, and that the results will be published online.
Omicron is a variant characterized by 26-32 mutations in the spike protein, which is responsible for infected cells by the COVID-19 virus.
According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single- nucleotide base, so it can detect " Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.  According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single- nucleotide base, which means it can detect " Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to detect by PCR tests.  According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single- nucleotide base, which enables it to detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to detect with PCR tests.
Currently, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test.  注意： Whole-genome analysis 是指对整个基因组进行分析， target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis 是指针对特定基因(如 spike protein )的突变进行分析， and PCR test 是指 PCR 扩增测试。
In the case of the Delta variant, PCR tests can detect it, but Omicron cannot.
Сегодгодoute дллбббянией книга now is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but molecular diagnostic technology.
的原始技术只显示了病毒的特定区域，但 molecular diagnostic 技术被设计成只有当 COVID-19 RNA 存在时引发核酸结合反应，从而实现快速检测。
according to Professor Lee, Omicron displays a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests, but a weak signal for S genes.
For the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S gene confirm positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.
molecular diagnostic techniques work in different mechanisms compared to PCR, efficiently detecting the Omicron variant.
Unlike conventional technology that typically processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 samples in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour).
Furthermore, this technology does not require specialized equipment, which allows it to make diagnostic kits quickly and easily.
As the method can develop a diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly, even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.  "As the method can develop a diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly, even if a new variant or virus emerges in the future."
"Я optimistice, hoping that the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee.
我们将试图迅速诊断并应对可能存在的COVID-19后变种。
该技术目前仍处于商业化阶段。
however, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where PCR test for Omicron has not been developed.  注意：在翻译时，应该根据具体的语境和句子结构进行适当的调整和变换，以达到更好的翻译效果。
Professor Lee said, "Я тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя тебя

Long queues for Banksy's shirts with support for statue-topping protesters.
ч悦地降生 crowd of desperate people in Bristol, UK, who have seen the mysterious street artist Banksy's designed shirts.
它们被释放以支持正在审判因推翻奴隶贸易雕塑而被捕的抗议者 during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year.  Pravda.ru does not have a translation for "Limited edition". However, here is a translation of the rest of the sentence:  The limited edition "souvenir shirts" designed by Banksy were intended to commemorate the trial of four individuals who were charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year.
"All profits go to the defendants, so they can enjoy a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram.
The shirt was sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT at several shops and was limited to only one item per person. It has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it.
A almost two-minute-long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers.
UK media reported that thousands were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it.  " thousand" чч  – чч  – чч  – чч :: "Bristol" чч :: чч  – чч  – чч
它也涉及一个倒扣的 bronze 纪念17世纪 merchant Edward Colston，他参与跨大西洋奴隶贸易。

Some praised the trader for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, but in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city, the controversial trader's statue was attacked.
Стан建设社員再次向 Bristol Harbour  city council 表示诚挚的道歉，并承诺采取一切措施，确保类似事件不再发生。 city council 表示已收到您们的道歉信，但仍将继续采取措施，确保类似的事件不会再次发生。同时， city council 还决定在 Bristol Harbour 建立一个专门的遗址，以纪念这些建设社員在抗议活动中遭受的不幸经历。 city council 还决定在遗址上建立一个博物馆，以展示您们所做出的贡献和牺牲，并让更多的人了解您们的历史。

Assam anti-CAA outfit pays tributes to people who died during protests
Five addkelaets were killed during the anti-CAA stimulatons in Assam two years ago.
On Sunday, several organizations in Assam remembered the five activists who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the law.
Memorial meetings were held at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati. Attendees resolved to once again intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.
The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was one of the first groups to organize protests against the CAA when it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to thegitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence.
Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a leader of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organizations" must take the lead in resuming the movement.  In Russian:  Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a leader of theKrishak Mukti Sangram Samiti during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organizations" must take the lead in resuming the movement.  "We cannot continue to let these deaths go ignored. Political parties and nationalist organizations must take the lead in resuming the movement," Gogoi said.
Confronting the artistes' society that had taken center stage in the 2019 agitation, he said, "We cannot expect them to organize agitations."
Their help is crucial, but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement.
Another key player in the stir, the All Assam Students' Union (AASU), organized a memorial on the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground.
speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out. Instead, it has continued to evolve and gain strength, with various sectors taking different stances and making their voices heard."
It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of exams (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns.  Pravda.ru原文： 它已经失去了其强度，原因是 exams 开始 (2020 年 1 月) 以及随后的 pandemic 和封锁。
С once again resuming full intensity of agitation我们将再次进行积极的活动。
"我们将不会让他们白白牺牲，" he said.
Mr. Bhattacharya said that the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one, just like in 2019.
Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the program organized by AASU.
"Сеurouc point out that we won't accept the CAA, and that's for certain."
"和政府试图使我们困惑，但我们不会允许他们使我们接受它，他说。"
Several groups, including AASU, North East Students' Organization (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of theCAA in Parliament.
Yes, that means that when I exercise, I don't really care how many calories it burns, and I don't change my numbers or macros because of the amount I've burned.
Я  try to stick to the 1200-1300.
However, if I feel particularly hungry, yes, I will eat something to replenish my energy and accept that weight loss may be slower today, or it may be faster.
只要自己已经进行了500卡路里的饮食削减，那么在进行一场艰苦的 workout 后，再多吃一口 steak 或者 bread 也不会破坏自己的进步。
Maybe it will just narrow your deficit one day.
"An extra piece of pizza or a bowl of ice cream, though?"
那样的做不可行。
If you always need to eat more because you are working out, consider not reducing the number of calories at all.
Maybe start with a 300- deficit.
hope this有用！
"错过比特币"
EverGrow might be the next big crypto to explode in 2022.
Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral, and despite being down almost 60% from its all-time high, the market capitalization still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto by valuation.  注意：这里使用了“ meme-crypto” 这个词，它通常指的是一种流行文化中的加密货币，但在这里的含义是指一种不太受重视的加密货币，因为它的曝光率和知名度相对较低。
С易色器100美元 investment at launch would be worth over 200 million today!
MANY are undoubtedly kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble.
Shiba's run was the result of a combination of very clever marketing and excessive hype, which led to a surge in investors, driven by FOMO, to jump into the meme-coin.

Realistically, Shiba Inu does not provide any tangible utility or value, and there appears to be little effort to do so in the future.
being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would've been plenty of opportunity for development, had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so. (Zh禁徹貼亞易賣庫廣闊與與賣庫內容豐富)
however, there are several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the others and regain their popularity, based on real utility and fundamental value.
Just 10 weeks ago, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain, and marketing experts.  Or in YAML format:  10. week ago, EverGrow Coin (EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain, and marketing experts.
One groundbreaking aspect of their project is the fact that the token pays a stable currency to its holders.
In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over 30 million dollars of Binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegging 1-to-1 with the USD.
according to BSCScan, the project currently has 110,000 holders.
With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly reached over 1 billion in market-cap. However, just weeks into the launch, a major data error on CoinMarketCap caused widespread panic among investors.
With such a brand new project, trust can take a long time to establish. This panic was utilized by a series of articles, which it is据说 were paid for by the project's rivals, who utilized incorrect information to try to lure EverGrow investors away from the project.
Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and EverGrow sunk to below $300 million in valuation.

昨天的相反， CoinMarket Cap在 EverGrow 页面上发布了一个警报，确认数据错误已经得到了纠正。
产品价格现已稳定，而重新恢复信心的迹象表明，价格上升了22%。
Nevertheless, EverGrow still remains far below the highs achieved before this error.
EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
除掉显而易见的 USD rewards的优点，项目背后的团队已经在官方网站上推出了一个SWAP dApp，最近还宣布了即将发布的Crypto Wallet，承诺超越 Trust Wallet 或 Safemoon Wallet 提供的功能，并提供了一整套Utilities，包括内容创建平台、NFT市场 Place 和 lending，旨在为投资者带来持续的价值。
"Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?"  Note: Shiba Inu is a Japanese cryptocurrency that gained popularity in recent years, but EverGrow Coin is not a cryptocurrency by any recognized entity.
With Shiba Inu, which offers little to no utility and is valued around 66 times more than EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and groundbreaking project like EverGrow to see serious upside from their current low market cap.
If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency, and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in for 2022.

It also leads to some terrible User Experience (UX).
Even though Apple increased the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a few apps, why does the user need to perform a full OS upgrade every time?

Note: The phrase " Better for the developers" and " Better for the end user" are subjective and open to interpretation. It is the author's belief that bundling app updates as OS updates is beneficial for both parties.

French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to require London for more licenses, as tensions between France and the UK over post- Brexit fishing rights escalate.

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece as follows:
fax-fax: RURAL 冰雪运动中心与中国国家男子冰球隊建立合作伙伴关系  [2023-02-16]  RURAL 冰雪运动中心与中国国家男子冰球隊建立合作伙伴关系。双方同意在冰球运动方面的合作，包括训练、比赛和赞助等。双方还同意在中国建立冰球训练中心，并在中国开展冰球比赛。
French Ministry of Armed Forces on Saturday stated that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialed a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates.   Russian translation: 第四天，法国武装部队部{ ministry of armed forces }宣布，与雅典签订一份防御合同已“不久之前”完成。“美国国务院已批准的潜在出售美国 Frigates 的批准”，作為回应，法国武装部队部{ ministry of armed forces }再次表示，有數名國家及地區已經關注了這份合同，並已經向體庫商授權。
自从我们与 Greeks进行了讨论以来，美国的提议已经不再放在桌面上了...
We also signed a contract with the Greeks.
Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," as it had been negotiated at the "Highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis.  Zhabotinsky:  Greece's Defense Ministry has also confirmed that the deal with Paris is "final," as it had been negotiated at the "Highest level possible" and personally announced by the Greek PM.
The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek parliament "soon."  Note: The use of " allegedly expected" indicates that there may be some doubt or uncertainty about the accuracy of the information. The translation provided is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as legal or official advice.
尤里·加加林斯克·米哈伊洛维奇·弗拉基米罗维奇·Lockheed Martin 表示，在 Friday 的交易中，美国 Defense Security Cooperation Agency 批准了以 69 亿美元出售四艘 Lockheed Martin  combat frigates。此外，该 agency 还通过了以 25 亿美元升级希腊 MEKO 级 frigates 的 separate program。
Announcement caused concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing subcontracting deal between France and Australia was interrupted by a bombastic AUKUS pact in September without any prior warning.
Exceeding anger, Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back." Two weeks later, Macron, with the Greek PM, personally announced the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion. He said it was time to "stop being naive," while praising the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty."
Сейейейт, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.  On Sunday, the body responsible for overseeing the elections in Libya appeared close to collapse after saying that it was unable to announce the candidates approved for the first time since the elections were planned in December.
With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.
Foreign powers will also fear that the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term, they will have to agree on whether or not the temporary government should continue in order to fill the political void and prevent a return to civil war.
的一系列法院裁决推翻了Libyan选举委员会的决定，以阻止包括前独裁者 Muammar Gaddafi之孙 Saif al-Islam Gaddafi在内的高知名度人物参加总统选举。
Interim prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, who serves as the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have been approved by the commission, but have subsequently been appealed by other parties.
In a statement on Saturday, the organization said that it could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly 100 who have applied because it was " keen to exhausted all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."
two rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.
In the case of Dbeibah, he had promised as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election, but has since argued in court that this was a moral commitment with no legal basis.
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.
他以為他沒有干錯。
The presence of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries, and indigenous militia makes the country a tinderbox, and it is feared that an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.
As a sign of the tensions regarding foreign forces, France is urging the European Union to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it claims operates in Libya and the Sahel.
莫斯科否认称瓦哈比与 Russian gov't 有关，并表示它将对欧盟对其公民实施的制裁进行报复。
委员会要求Libya的政治团体遵守2月最初商定的12月选举日期，但此要求受到以下因素的影响：任命一位联合国特别代表ánán Kubiš，他在选举前三个星期辞职，尽管他在任内只有不到一年。

Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has a deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.  Note: The above translation may not fully convey the intended meaning since it uses a more formal and literary style, and the sentence structure is different from the original. A more natural and colloquial Russian translation would be:  Сегодгод候， Russia did not approve her appointment as a full envoy, but she has a deep understanding of Libya and last year showed a willingness to confront those in the political class who are opposed to elections.
UN mission published a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, citing the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards, and large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.
The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."   This statement suggests that the decision not to participate in elections and instead to use force to block them is not a viable or ethical approach to ensuring a fair and transparent选出新的领导人. It also implies that external factors, such as powerful backers, can have a significant influence on the outcome of elections, rather than the will of the citizens themselves.
German says time is running out for Iran nuclear deal.
Germany's foreign minister on Saturday warned that time is running out to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.  Pavel Ponomaryov  ().
Negotiations have been resumed in Vienna in an attempt to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to assess the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations.
" time is running out" / " time is running out for us" / " time is running out in this meeting"  Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister, told reporters in Liverpool, England, where G7 foreign ministers are meeting that the clock is ticking.

“Barack Obama said that Iran had resumed negotiations with a position that put the negotiations back six months.”

The current round of negotiations in Vienna occurred after a five-month pause following the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi.
earlier, US officials said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.
A top State Department official stated that there was an " intense" conversation among the G7 countries, where all parties were united in their stance on nuclear talks.
"The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back onto the negotiating table and that a deal can still be reached, but the window of opportunity is closing, so we are united in our efforts to find a solution." ( translation based on the given text)
official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks. --> Стант провел addendum, stating that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley is returning to Vienna for negotiations.

Avalanche in Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5
On Saturday, a avalanche occurred at a ski resort in Washington state, which was used for backcountry skiing. The avalanche resulted in the death of a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapped five others.
应以俄語為本句的翻譯："An avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle," said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.

Самая another skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get lost in the snow.
All were wearing avalanche beacons.
Although all those involved in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just within the boundaries of the Crystal Mountain Resort.
private ski resort determines the conditions, but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.   private ski resort:  private property,  conditions: the conditions under which skiing is done,  nothing: there are no restrictions or limitations on skiing,  that stops: that prevents,  skiers: skiing enthusiasts,  from going: from going to the ski resort  because the property abuts public lands: because the property is located next to public lands,
fcst, Frank DeBerry, president and CEO of the resort, said that all six men holding the resort's uphill travel passes were registered with the ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property, and were required to check the snow conditions before their excursion.
Skiers can travel at will anywhere in the national forest.
"They went into the forest, but ended up back in the boundaries (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said.
In addition to closing the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola due to strong winds that reached 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).
"Avalanche came during the season's first major snowfall."
The area is under winter storm warning until Sunday morning. National Weather Service said that 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).
我们已经错过了季节的开头，现在从几乎没有雪到一场巨大的雪风暴。
"People got excited," DeBerry said.
"我们每个人必须记住，这是一种带着风险的运动。"
Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in the state of Washington, covering 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

Scholz, Polish prime minister, discuss migration, energy, EU.
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, visited Warsaw on Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on issues such as migration, energy, European Union matters, and tensions east of the bloc's border.
He was greeted with military honors by Morawiecki in front of the Polish premier's office.
It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday.  注意：句子中使用了"swear in"这个词，它的意思是"宣誓就职"，因此在翻译成俄语时需要将其转换为"宣誓就职"。在这种情况下，翻译为"当他于 Wednesday 随着人们组成的 coalition Cabinet 宣誓就职时"即可。
Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry Russian gas directly to Germany, saying that it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries and exposes it to pressure from Moscow.
Germany's regulatory authority has suspended the approval process for the completed pipeline due to legal issues.
Из restaurctions изявет ее government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there.
Scholz和 Morawiecki还将讨论在 Germany 的新政府下复杂双边关系。
Good neighborly ties still get overwhelmed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which believes that Germany owes Poland compensation for战时 damages.
Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, Deputy Director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on the EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner.  (Agnieszka Lada-Konefal is the Deputy Director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt. She expects the government of President Joe Biden to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on the EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner.)
visiting comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratification a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation.
Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday.
She expressed Germany's support for Poland, where the government is reportedly encouraging illegal migration by migrants, resulting in the closure of the eastern border to them.
She also called for humanitarian treatment of migrants stuck at the border.
Poland and the EU say that the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the European Union by encouraging migration into its countries.
On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and北约 officials in Brussels.  Note: The Russian translation is slightly different from the original sentence due to the use of different prepositions and phrases. However, the meaning of the sentence remains the same.
Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure.  "号外！" 号外！ 當然沒有的：  Schlusser, a left-wing politician, became the 9th Prime Minister of Germany after World War II. He served as Prime Minister for 16 years, until the collapse of the German Democratic Republic in 1991.  In 1991, after the collapse of the German Democratic Republic, Germany and the United States agreed to establish the European Union (EU). This marked the start of a new era for the EU, which saw the growth of the Union and the integration of its member states.  Schlusser played a key role in the formation of the EU, and his legacy in Germany is still felt today. He was one of the first politicians to propose the idea of EU membership for Germany, and his efforts to improve the relationship between the EU and Germany made him a controversial figure at times. However, his support for the EU and his efforts to promote economic growth and cooperation have been widely recognized as important contributions to the history of the EU.

Russia warned of "Consequences" if Ukraine attacked.
According to a draft statement, the Group of Seven has warned Russia of the consequences and costs of attacking Ukraine, which would have massive implications and severe costs.
Russian intelligence believes that the US could be planning to launch a multi-front offensive on Ukraine next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.
Kremlin denyes its plans to invade and says the West is gripping by Russophobia.
Moscow claims that the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has disregarding the assurance given to it during the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates expressed their unity in their condemnation of Russia's military buildup near Ukraine and called on Moscow to de-escalate.
"Russians should not doubt that any further military aggression against Ukraine would have serious consequences and significant costs," the draft statement said, according to G7 sources.
"We resolutely affirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future."
For Moscow, the growing NATO integration of a neighboring former Soviet republic - and the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine aimed at Russia - is a "red line" that it will not allow to be crossed.

In 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, which led to the West imposing sanctions on Russia.
today's news, the Kremlin stated that Mr Putin told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops do not pose a threat and that Moscow is being criticized for moving troops within its own territory.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States regarding Moscow's "red lines."
G7 consists of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, and the United States, and includes a representative from the European Union.
"We  Calling on Russia to de-escalate, to pursue diplomatic channels and to abide by its international commitments on the transparency of military activities," the G7 said in the draft.
"We reconfirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format in the goal of achieving the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine."

separately, Mr Biden has said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay "a terrible price" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.  注意：这里使用了“ separately”表示两个不同的人在不同的时间和地点讨论这个问题，这是英语中的固定搭配。同时，使用了“ pay a terrible price”和“ face devastating economic consequences”来强调俄罗斯在入侵乌克兰 would 会遇到严重的经济和政治后果。

我现在正在为CompTIA A+课程提供免费培训。
这份课程包含18个模块，我将为每个模块制作一个单独的视频。
某些视频中的一些内容可能有点长，因为它们在每视频中都是一个完整的模块。如果您需要特定主题，请尽管在描述中使用时间戳。如果您只想 refresh 某些主题，请尽管使用时间戳。
time stamps are there to make your life easier, so if you end up reading the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for lost teeth, it's your own fault.
Я will make 20 videos for this course, the first one is just the 4 minute introductory video about the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video, and then there will be 18 more videos that will cover your modules.
training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated, if there is a exam associated to that specific course.  In Russian, this sentence can be translated as:  "the training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated with those specific courses, provided there is an associated exam for that course".
只要自己有关于一个模块或课程中的特定主题需要更多的澄清，请随时提问，我会尽力回答，只要我在线。

When tornadoes are imminent, the weather guys usually say "Take cover now!" in Russian.
危事物，因为你不确定它是在两分钟内还是十分钟内，还是其他时间。
Я д的去 with regard to what right they have to actually forbidden people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover.
你敢想象当那辆汽车着陆时，人群是如何试图从停车场出来的吗？
They'd all have been killed.
" BUT if they were like "Keep working!", the Russian translation would be "И if they were like 'Keep working!' ".
instead of "Take Shelter!", the Russian translation would be "Takeshelter!"
须知此事不同寻常。
Do anybody know if they are still working or if they were hiding somewhere?
的愿望，以保护和安全所有孩子 this Christmas
Her brother nearly two had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus.
thus there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers.
But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead, when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant emerges.
My granddaughter is four, which means that half of her life - half of her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic.
自从她 properly became aware, she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing, and keeping your distance.
On several occasions ( amidst various lock-downs) when I saw her, I didn't know whether or not to kiss her.
What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child?  Pediatric brain is highly receptive and at the same time very alert, it is able to process and understand a wide range of information, even if it is very young children. So, the question is what kind of information would be sent to this type of brain when a tiny child is playing andSuddenly stops, looking around and asking "What is that?"  It is important to note that the brain development of children is very different from that of adults, so the way information is processed and understood may be different for a child than for an adult.
"I am afraid to think."

AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven.  Note: The original sentence is in the past tense and uses the verb "knew", which is in the present tense in Russian. The translation above is a simplified version of the original sentence that may not accurately convey the same meaning.

"How was the farewell to Etho like?"  Note: The text "Etho" is not clear if it is a name or a person, so I used a generic name "Etho" for the translation.
Precisely by way of quick disclaimer: I am not the account owner but rather her husband.
Я еously 物理化学的客員， because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P)
second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to create drama and do not suspect something is not right.
据报道，这只是一股风的变化，这并不适合每个人。
I'm just an old fan, fulfilling a nostalgia streak.
With that out of the way, let's move on to the next task.
Стал back in the day used to be a huge Mindcrack fan.
绝不要错过GuudeBoulderfist的任何一首歌曲，我非常热爱 collaborating with others等等。
While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a video that details Etho's channel history.
near the end, it mentioned Mindcrack going commercial.
How he didn't see it in a positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts.
again, neither going "pro" nor keeping it casual is a wrong decision, and I know people go in different directions and such.   againns, nswering neither pro nor keeping it casual is a wrong decision, and i know people go in different directions and such.
quick Google led me to this old thread, which shows his side of things.  在线搜索引擎 Quick Google 引我到一个古老的帖子，该帖子展示了他的方面的东西。
primarily, knowing things need to be spoken with care, but what truly captures the essence is that you viewed things from a different perspective, but overall, you remained on good terms.
э和地方的故事是在我转向其他事物之后发生的，所以对我来说一切都是全新的。
"What I'm looking for is the other side of the picture."
As I previously mentioned, my mental health isn't very good. Seeing an old group that I was fans of as a fan without some of the dumb explosions that are so common in polarization of public discourse could be nice and stuff.
"What was the response from 'the old gang'?"
Was你总是一起进行某件事情？
Did you slowly drift apart?
stillchat or invite one another to events?  注意： 这句话中的单词“event”在俄语中有两种含义：1. 事件，指某种具体的事情或活动；2. 机会，指某种可能性或机会。因此，这句话的正确翻译可能是：  仍然聊天，或者邀请对方参加事件？
Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats.  这里的“again”是副词，用来强调前面的“not expecting anything”和“to see people at each other's throats”之间的重复，因此需要翻译为“再次”(zh-----na seconda)，意思为“ again” 与“not expecting anything”和“to see people at each other's throats”之间的重复，因此需要翻译为“再次”(zh-----na seconda)，意思为“ again” 与“not expecting anything”和“to see people at each other's throats”之间的重复。
"K Kinda o反對."
In a way, it's a low-key way of closing off something small in my life, to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt.
"P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and theloads you collected."  In Russian, the phrase "couldn't help but see" is " couldn't help but notice," and the translation for "the buttloads you collected" is "theloads you collected."
那样子真是棒极了！
Allow me a moment to search for you.
Currently, it seems that we have no more pieces to add, so I will check to see when we are expecting more.
Doesn't look like there are any future plans to manufacture single sections无奈地。

在加州的阿尔巴特区的一个地点，向我施展了相似的诈骗。
When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause).  In Russian, this sentence can be translated as:  When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car, which I did not cause.
必须以书面形式签署以承认“ Damage”.
Я с令牌和照片，这些照片和视频都没有覆盖汽车的的底部。

没有人能够看到那种损坏(在我返回车辆时)。
None of it was visible in the photos I took when I returned the car, so I disputed the claim.
他们用否认来拒绝解决争议，并要求立即支付因破坏而产生的费用。
Since it was a work trip, I handed over my photos to our legal department.
minutes later, I received a letter from Alamo stating that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.
如果用我自己的话，我毫无疑问会支付那个修理费，因为我确信那 damage 不是在我照顾下发生的。

thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers.

"Author of 'Interview with the Vampire'去世于80岁生日之际"
she died due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said.
Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.  In Russian, this sentence would be translated as:  缩略词： Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.
"Possessive of Lestat as the person of action, the one who could accomplish tasks that I am unable to, I had an idea of him."
"Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre, which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series.  "Сествуй ддд с令牌屋" ("Sword of the Vampire" in Russian) was a successful feature film released in 1994, which helped to reignite interest in the vampire genre. The film was based on the original novel of the same name by Stephenie Meyer, which was later adapted into the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series.
According to her website biography, while Rice lived most of her life in California, she is a native of New Orleans and many of her stories were set there.
熊林(邹容)的儿子邹容(1917年-2006年9月16日)，当时只有17岁，曾就读于清华大学，后转往苏联学习。在苏联期间，他参加了反法西斯战争。1945年，当斯大林格勒战役的胜利消息传来时，他赋诗一首以示庆祝，这首诗后来成为了《在斯大林格勒的日日夜夜》的开头。1953年，邹容从苏联回国，并加入了中国共产党。1956年，他因在《人民军队英雄纪念碑》的建筑设计工作中的贡献而获得了全国奖。1964年，他因对国防事业作出的贡献而被授予苏联最高苏维埃社会主义劳动英雄称号。1993年1月1日，他被授予中华人民共和国英雄模范人物称号。
Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, according to him.
" shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D" 翻译成 Russian为 " shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D".
"Enterprise-D" of "The Next Generation" has **three** launch bay.
During the show, we always see shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.
这两种无人机的机仓由一个大型的工作室家具组成，可以容纳大型无人机设备。
我总是很喜欢在 episodes 展示  twin shuttlebays at the back of the midsection, neck, or whatever you want to call it.
“缓め儿 我们未曾见过的主要飛機 bay。”
它还位于主要桥的下方，位于第3和第4 decks，很可能会是一个巨大的设施。
instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it, all the way down to deck 13.  P.S. Please note that the sentence is written in English, but the translation provided in the above sentence is for English speakers only. For those who prefer using Russian, you may need to adjust the sentence accordingly.
In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life.  P.S.: Thank you for correcting my mistake in the translation. I apologize for the confusion. The correct translation would be: "In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life."
Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay, with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.  `有些角色会透过一扇通往机甲舱的门进行交谈，这扇门与微型场景和机甲船并列，为了使船具有规模感和生命感。`
Could they not have done this on TNG?
我们在《最好的东西，第二部分》中看到了Worf和Data从主 shuttlebay launch 了一个 shuttle，但是 shuttle 的launch 被观察到 shuttle 内部。
我们只需看到窗外 wall  outside the window，当飞船飞出去时，迅速被太空所取代。
The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."  Note: "Cause and Effect" is a book by David Foster Foster. It is not a movie or TV show.
We receive a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressed the main shuttlebay and get a quick look inside, along with a few parked shuttles.
不知是否有足够的信息来回答这个问题，即为什么主 shuttlebay从来没有在这两个例子之外被观察到。  "Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?"

used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole.  This sentence appears to be a phrase that describes a method or process of transportation, with "used" indicating that the action of transporting has been done. The phrase can be translated into Russian as "used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole" (replacing the word "your" with "mine").
"Станнт Softie 12 Osprey, similar to many other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series, has been assigned a NATO Stock Number."
The quilted top of the bag is cut, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord, making it pull into shape, much like a jacket hood.
To prevent the 2-way zip from catching either the zip baffle or the bag edges, a "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewing into place behind the zip.

South Africa 恣意表达对最后种族隔离领导人德克貝克的敬意。
On Sunday, South Africa officially paid tribute to FW de Klerk, the last president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.
de Klerk died on November 11, 1991, aged 85, following a battle with cancer.
为国家哀悼四周。
他从1989年到1994年担任总统，并被广泛记住，是因为他领导了 South Africa 从白人少数统治向第一次多种族议会选举的转型。
库德洛(De Klerk)也在1993年与曼德拉(Mandela)分享了诺贝尔和平奖，当时他们在1990年将它们从 prison 中解放出来。
Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.  Mandela became South Africa's first black president when his African National Congress (ANC) party won the 1994 election.
Presidential candidate Cyril Ramaphosa attended on Sunday morning the Protestant Groote Kerk in Cape Town, one of South Africa's oldest churches, in honor of Nelson Mandela's memory.
"Due to his excessive correctness, he was often misunderstood," Elita Georgiadis, De Klerk's widow, told about 200 attendees.
Я永远的记住這個人，讓我們情相惜，也讓我想幫助他完成那個巨大的任務。
A private mass and the national anthem were previously performed, followed by the ceremony, which featured a portrait of Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.
Despite a positive reputation abroad, de Klerk divided opinion in South Africa, and his death prompted mixed reactions.
Critics claim that he remains intertwined with apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.
De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority.  Note: The National Party was a white-majority political party in South Africa and its stance on apartheid was controversial. The phrase "non-white majority" refers to the racial makeup of the country at the time, which was predominantly black, but this is not an exact translation of the original sentence.
outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.  In Russian, this sentence can be translated as:   outside the church, a small group of protesters presented signs with the words " justice delayed" and " justice for apartheid victims" and were quickly taken away by police.
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.  Note: This is a simplified translation, and there may be some nuances in the original sentence that are not captured in this translation.
During his final years, comments about Klerk also tarnished his image, amidst criticism for his failure to officially apologize for the crimes of apartheid.
In 2020, he denied that apartheid was a crime against humanity, before retracting the statement and apologizing.
De Klerk's foundation released ahumous video apologizes "for the pain, hurt, dignity and damage that apartheid has caused" to South Africa's non-white populations.

moving the trailer
用油管说话
Я colaborated with the owner on an install, and when we came back, he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster.
没有理由，只是空间，所以他把它留在那。
第二天早上，我来上班，然后 Jerry (这个名字不是真的)走过来，看上去非常愤怒。
没有什么新东西，他一直是有点不满的古老男人。
С вemo w9n59 coup9t9s9 s9pli9ga9tov9 (18 y9n9m9n9, та9n9t19 э7e8n19t9e9独14.)
Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster?  Note: The translation may vary depending on the context and the style of the conversation.
"Седа:  non,  Owners drived yesterday."
Jerry: 你不能在那里停车那个 trailers，那样我就不能进垃圾桶了！
"Eu: Eu nivo domaio o carro para isto, mas eu posso move-lo."
Jerry:  unknown reason why you would park that trailer there.
Знае是他们需要拥有访问垃圾池的权限。
"对于我来说， but I didn't park it there."
为国家和人民的利益，我们不应该放弃我们的自由。
Jerry:  blah blah blah 您的错，可恨的孩子们不尊重您， blah blah blah
"Я: 但它不是我。"
这段对话以这种方式持续了几分钟，他数落我因为把 trailer  leaving in the way 而不是按照约定的方式离开。
从那时起，直到我离开那个 cabinets 店两年后，每当我工作 late (这在经常的情况下)，并且 5x8  trailer 留在 shops，我都会拿起 Trailon 并把它正确地卷到 dumpster 上，让 Jerry 在早上找到它。
我们的产品曾两次及以上经历电力中断。
step 1: Get someone on the door immediately.  P.S.: Please note that the translation provided is just a suggestion, and it may not accurately convey the original meaning without further context.
They are now security.
绝对不可以让任何人进入，而且当人们在离开时请注意他们(特别是孩子们的手)。
step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there -> step 2: call store manager if they are not present
Step 3: those who are at the checkout and anyone else are free to wait a couple of minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again.
step 4:  tour the store and force every non-employee to leave.
"As well as every cart brought to the front" 竭尽所能地
Step 5: 浏览 cart 以寻找任何寒冷和食品。
Step 6: Return the cold/produce it.
Step 7:  cover all non-doored cold, e.g. cheese, meat, vegetables, etc.
Step 8:  sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out.  心悸8:  signet our 名 on a paper as we left to be clock out.
有些人被允许离开得更早，特别是在黑暗的情况下不舒服或者还有6个小时的时间的限制时。
It's really dark, even upfront.  Here is a potential Russian translation for the sentence:  Стант really dark, even outside.
不可大意地我们无法让客户简单地仅供参考。
Я ломом相矛盾的地方，就是部分 ATM 仍然具有一些功能，而另一些则没有。
不确定，但我认为我们没有办法让他们支付。
Я dokumentably длл back issues, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later.
只有一次，重新开启电力只花了大约3小时。
They asked a few of us to stay, so if it did as they were told by the power company, we could re-open.
As long as we have the option to stay or not, and we are helping out in preserving the product as best as we can, I don't mind.
缺乏选择，以及危及客户，这是我的底线。
遗憾地，这个项目目前缺货。我会看看是否该项目会再次推出。
Д忧地莫得玻璃心。
This product has been discontinued, so it will not be restocked. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
噢，非常 glad you asked，因為我有很多事情要說明這個事情。
Yes, there’s been a pretty drastic change.  Note: " pretty drastic change" is a phrase in English and its Russian translation would be "precially significant change" or "pretty significant change".
早已被诊断出 overweight/ obese，自3岁时就一直如此，因此，在此之前，这就是我所知道的一切。
绝大数家庭和朋友一起 treat me the same and are SO.
"Damn" is a common Russian word that can be translated as "Goddamn" or "Damn it".
"Supportive" in Russian can be translated as "sustainable", "able to support", or "supportive of".
Я их те有一些， which were already strained, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
这道菜可能是他们或我的问题，因为我认为他们已经习惯在我的头上排泄，而我现在甚至不愿意接受他们的排泄物。
尤里·阿列克谢耶维奇·卡德莫夫(Yuri Alexeyevichevich Adzhubei)曾经要求我为他 weight loss 做出解释。
总的来说，他们暗示他们自己是我到达这里的主要动力，以支持的名义。然而，实际上，他们在我完成 RGBY(Random滚轮转圈减肥计划)之前甚至都不知道我正在进行这些更改。
事实上，他们是唯一通知我的人，有意为之，因为我不想让他们试图控制我并迫使我像以前一样让他们。
Un unsurprisingly, now they've taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.  (Note: The translation may vary depending on the context and the style of the writing.)
initially, they just私下 messaged me these things, but when I didn't respond, they started commenting on it publicly on social media, without any shame.
Коwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwh
Fortunately, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it's in excess these days).  Luckly, my skin is thicker now (not just because it's in excess these days).
"С陌生igam  attention from strangers by far the weirdest part for me."
When I was bigger, people really didn't pay me any attention.  P.S.: Please note that the translation might not be entirely accurate due to the fact that the sentence is written in a specific way in English, and the same may not be true in Russian.
Like, little to no eye contact.
nonny obychoty o lyublyu lyublyu v medozhestvennom promenade imennom, unless they knew me.
绝壁不会竭尽全力去帮助或赞美我。
但它比我发现得更加孤立，因为这是我一直以来的习惯。
Я awared always that people might be critical of my size - many of them doing it openly - but I never realized the tiny level of it, and just how subtle it can be until I lost weight.
尤不仅仅因为我习惯了它，而没有意识到它，但我也认为那些 perpetuate it 的人不是 actively aware they're doing it 的。
я seriously believe that it is a subliminal bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in the media, that many people just don't realize they are projecting.
Nowadays, it feels like everyone is staring at me, smiling at me, and talking to me, etc.
Станш湿 both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that's just platonically.  Pravda both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that's just platonically.
romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like... everyone lol.  Домictically speaking, my dating pool has expanded from a small number of individuals who were willing to be seen with me to a much larger group of people, it feels like.
"It is DAUNTING" can be translated to Russian as "它是一个令人兴奋的事情" (it is a exciting thing).
Я expected that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront ( because I don’t want it to be a secret ) it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.
It looks like it did the opposite and made them more interested, actually.
Huge shock to me.
"Д裂考虑， though, for men who are newly talking to/dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like "I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven't realized how gorgeous you are yet" is NOT the way to go."
Я more times than I care to count听到了类似的 variation of this and they all thought it was a compliment.

"I am hard-pressed to think of a company that is not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, who uses its online infrastructure to protect websites from malicious actors.
untold millions of servers have been installed, and experts said that the fallout would not be known for several days.
Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity company Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing.  "This vulnerability has the potential to disrupt critical business operations, and it is unacceptable that it has not been identified and fixed in the past decade," Amit Yoran said.
The vulnerability, which has beendubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 by the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees the development of the software.
Anyone who has obtained an exploit can gain full access to an unpatched computer that is using the software.

The vulnerability, which is located in the open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba on November 24, the organization said.

Liz Truss pledge another £75 million in aid to Afghanistan at G7 meeting.
UK to provide another £75 million in aid to Afghanistan to address worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss announcement.
Foreign Secretary said that the commitment would help save lives and "support stability in the region."
following discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday regarding co-ordinated action to be taken in Afghanistan and engagement with Taliban rulers.
The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the Central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.  Note: The above translation may not be exact, as it may require further editing to improve clarity and accuracy.
Ms. Truss stated that "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter."
今天我们宣布的资金将挽救生命、保护女性和女孩并支持该地区的 stability.
"我们在为阿富汗人民做出所有努力。"
additional financial support will bring the UK's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.
它将被用于为性别暴力受害者提供支持并 funding essential child protection services.
The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritize those most at risk, including households headed by women and disabled people, according to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).
officials stated that no funding would be sent directly to the Taliban, instead it would be passed through the Afghanistan humanitarian fund, the World Food Programme (WFP), and other organizations.
WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.
EXECUTIVE director David Beasley said that the donation would "help us save many lives."
"What we are seeing on the ground is令人心痛 - 230 million people are facing极端饥饿，在一个受 drought、冲突和经济危机的影响下的国家，" he said.
" women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering, and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day."  Note: The sentence is in English, but the translation above is in Russian.
这个月的这周，联合国人道主义事务 chief表示，阿富汗的经济崩溃正"在我们眼前发生"，并敦促国际社会采取行动，阻止"自由落体"，以避免更多死亡。
"Martin Griffiths said: 'Its getting more and more dire by the week.'"
Сегодгодгод交流之后， ministers this week faced 尴尬的问题关于阿富汗撤离努力，这是在 MP 们的举报下完成的。
СССС年度上， Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed that only 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help, due to the "dysfunctional" and "chaotic" handling of the situation.
Mr. Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those who were hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.
他也是说鲍里斯· Johnson要求提供“相当大的能力”来 evacuate animals from a shelter run by formerRoyal Marine Paul "Pen" Farthing，这导致了 troops的生命处于危险之中，以帮助它们从 privately funded Plane 上撤离。
prime minister has called the claims "complete nonsense"
On Sunday at the Museum of Liverpool, Ms Truss will participate in discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them will do so virtually.
Foreign Secretary will emphasize the importance of working with南 Asian " economies of the future" in addressing the current challenges facing the West.
Invitation to Asian ministers comes after UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region.  Welfare of the Asian ministers is being requested after the UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move that is seen as aimed to counter China's growing influence in the region.
Я told you so...
Сеholes! Сеholes！为我工作的 grocery store was undergoing a complete and total reorganization.
Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was.  "Aisles" in this context refers to the narrow slots or channels that are found in the walls of a building or structure. The phrase "we were all learning where everything was" indicates that everyone in the group was engaged in learning about the location of various objects or elements within the building. The translation provided is a direct quotation from the original sentence and accurately conveys the meaning.
needless to say, it was a mess.
At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was.  注意：根据上下文，此处的“something”可能指代某个物品或事物。
Я no longer remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks?).
" straws?"
由于其 Customers 等待，我不能离开以帮助她找到，所以我告诉她“我相信他们现在在第 7  aisle”。
before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off.  P.S.: The sentence is in informal register and uses colloquial language, so the translation may not be perfect.
Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later and tell me they're not there.  Note: " storming back" means "to come back with a storm" in this context, it's more of a dramatic expression.
minutes later, I heard the manager's voice, saying "I'm sorry about that. I can't help you out on this one. Let's try again another day."
他的眼睛困惑了，他说：“好吧，也许他们在8。”
"Я協助您寻找它们，夫人。"
As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know."  In Russian translation: As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to give someone the address if you don't actually have it."
long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line.  Longer explanation short, she comes back to the checkout but goes to another line.
As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They were on aisle 7, just like you told her."   As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me " they were on aisle 7 just like you told her."
"HA...told you so!" translates to "сравн团...comRADE so!" in Russian.

double power failure in Gabba explained and why it could happen again.
risks of power failure inherent in Gabba's broadcast compound set-up unlikely to be improved before next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Source inform The Age and Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to power the extensive array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to transmit images worldwide.
Primary and backup generators responsible for global broadcast of Gabba Test went down about 25 minutes on day four.
这个原因是，基频 Power required to supply Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.  "As a result" in this context means "the consequence of that." It explains that the primary source of power for broadcasters is a large, diesel-fuelled generator that was hired for the Test match, and that back-up power is meant to be derived from a separate back-up generator.
Nevertheless, on the fourth day of the match, the failure of the primary generator connected with the backup generator caused both to down simultaneously, resulting in the complete or partial loss of broadcast images and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
NEP, the company that provides outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has demands an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
其他城市，包括 Adelaide Oval、 MCG、 SCG 和 Bellerive Oval 在 Hobart 使用，将提供主要电力供 broadcast media 使用，而 diesel 发电机将作为备用。

In addition, the older items are usually boarded as well.  P.S. Please note that the word " board" in this sentence is in the sense of "to remove the item from the inventory or stock" and not in the sense of "to put something on a shelf" as in "to board an item".

Nach获取到其他球队得知 FedEx Field 的 benches 需要重大升级的消息后， Cowboys 带来了自己的升级。
When they arrived at the stadium on Sunday, they were already dressed in Cowboys logos and lettermarks.
Dallas Mavericks received a message from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and expressed complaints about the malfunctioning heated benches.
earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury.   earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott made a comment about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, as heated benches can be beneficial to his knee injury.

"Hey r/Military!"
Я 来自美国的一个國家， where military service is mandatory, and I am just wondering how it's like for other countries.
Здравствуйте 所有人！
"Я from Estonia, where I am a part of the National Defense Force."
here 凝缩为 "here"   Military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29 凝缩为 "Military service is mandatory for all men between the ages of 16 and 29".
You need to complete either 8 or 11 months of training, after which you will be placed in the " reserves" unit until you turn 60.
during that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand that you participate in some military exercises once or twice a year, for approximately 2 weeks per year.
然而，您并不被强制前往外国执行任务。
"If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military guy with pay and such."
"Я just wondering how it is for other countries."
If you join the military, for example, in the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?
What are your thoughts on mandatory military service?
During my training in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada.
Unfortunately, despite our efforts, we really didn't have much time to socialize, and I couldn't ask those guys in person what it's like to serve in their country's military.

after all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help.  Note: A forensic audit is a type of audit conducted by a specialized body with expertise in crimes such as financial fraud, election fraud, and other types of criminal activity. It is typically used to investigate and evaluate the accuracy of elections results. A hand recount is a type of manual count of votes that is typically used to verify the accuracy of election results. It involves counting the votes manually and comparing them to the totals on the election results report. In the context of the sentence, a hand recount of the votes that were already counted may not have been necessary in order to verify the accuracy of the final election results.
Should we just keep allowing them to " Audit" votes until they get the results they want?

Water heater temperature and bath issue.
My water heater is set pretty low.
它是一个小的水罐在衣柜里(我住在一个古老的战前公寓)。
问题在于，它确实把 bathtub  fills up all the way  without going cold 完成了。
If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath?  "If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath?"
Or shall I save more electricity by heating my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath, once the water heater is empty?
Edit: Thank you for the advice everyone!
Я just a little地调了温度， and it worked.
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct, because even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has such a lot of insulation.

Enterprise didn't really bad in any way, but they were never as convenient as National, where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter.

Boris Johnson  teeters on the edge of favor with Tory MP's.
鲍里斯·约翰逊 long been considered a king of returns.
some Tory MP's hope that he will continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws.  Some political analysts believe that the recent events at Downing Street parties, which were held in defiance of COVID-19 laws, have had a negative impact on Prime Minister Johnson's popularity. Some MP's in the Conservative party hope that he will be able to turn this around by continuing to win them over with his leadership and policies.
的反义词可以是：  - A prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken, before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite. (一个人已经通过反复否认任何规则被打破了，在更多的报告和证据表明相反的情况下陷入了迷宫。) - The prime minister had gotten himself into a mess by continuously denying that any rules were broken, before more reports and evidence emerged to support the opposite. ( prime minister 陷入混乱，因为他 continuously 否认任何规则被打破了，直到更多的报告和证据支持了相反的说法。)
firstly, there was a video of No.10 aides laughing while they were discussing a Christmas gathering on December 18, last year.
Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest adviser, promised that pictures of parties had been taken, and with bated breath, critics of the government waited for them to surface.
When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No. 10 and at home, it was not exactly the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however.
С尺素寸断的 Sunday Mirror шоу features Johnson with two aides who are dressed up in tinsel and a Santa hat - they are not socially distanced from one another and clearly participating in a social event while mixing families.
ale896.blog.21c3.fc2.us/p/2a/96/92/But-it-could-have-been-worse.
ДevaMNI kresomshCI zvezda zvezda v Novem粘豆雲u i Conservative party headquarters v zvezdachih smerchenii, where people drinkpedifully amount of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialized until the midnight, sources have told media outlets including Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times.
Ministerial experts will quietly breathe a sigh of relief that no pictures of these scenes have been leaked yet.
"According to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think that people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows Johnson hosting a virtual quiz - a familiar sight during the pandemic."
对父母的翻译是：他们在喝酒，从10房间的不同房间打电话，并且没有保持社交距离，无法看到。
On Sunday, Nadhim Zahawi坚称图片只是 Johnson "感谢他的工作人员"的例子，并用它来淡化派对丑闻为"烟雾弹"。
He told LBC: "On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a Prime Minister in his office, with the two close people that work with him, without alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."  In Russian, the translation would be:  He told LBC: "On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a Prime Minister in his office, with the two close people that work with him, without alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."
Much damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister for allowing a "one rule for them" narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson.  The English sentence suggests that much has been done already to damage the country, and the MP's are angry because the prime minister allowed a "one rule for them" narrative to develop, from Cummings to Hancock and recently Paterson.
Johnson is teetering on the edge of favor with his own MP's; if further photos emerge, they may push him over the edge.
