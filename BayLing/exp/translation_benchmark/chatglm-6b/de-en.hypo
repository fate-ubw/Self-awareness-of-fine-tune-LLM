I am #PRS_ORG# major and therefore it is no problem for me.
Ichch would like to provide you with just a number or instructions regarding the package that I should upload, damit it can be addressed as a return address.
Ich habe vor ein paar Tagen die #PRS_ORG# bestellt... für 249€.
They are offering 179€ today.
I find it really, well said, very irritating.
Should I store the order and re-place it for the better price, or is there another option for the credit card?
I also believe that it is fundamentally wrong for kids to assume the role of parents for their little siblings.
However, I find it quite good that big siblings are also willing to take care of the little ones.
Just a quick look, just a quick help, just bring the wallet, etc.
Therefore, they learn responsibility, help their family members, and are committed.
So long as they can be themselves even as children, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is staying alone for the short time and it's okay for him, that's actually good.
You can most effectively determine if it fits your children.
It's not about him collecting K2 and waiting for his entry to be ready.
Rein rechtlich ist es wahrscheinlich fragwürdig.
Perhaps the statement of a psychologist is also related to this.
Because if something like a brand, incorporation, epidemic, invasion, etc. should really happen, it would be quite too much responsibility for K1 to focus on K2.
Whether this is a risk you are willing to take is ultimately your choice ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a thriller some years ago and I can still remember almost the entire operation, however, I don't think the title "Partout" will still fit. perhaps someone here knows more...
The history was about treating feelings of anxiety.
At the beginning of history, a bird of prey became self-destructive, by covering itself with food and going to its prey in the sky.
The case is transferred to a clinical psychologist after a short consultation with his therapists, who then takes a medical clinic where they treat patients with anxiety.
The police officer has a small child who also has fear (of fire) and lands at this therapist's office.
It's becoming more self-improvement and there is a separate protagonist - a photographer who is ethically bound to go to the location of each self-kill and document it, and to post the photos on the internet.
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist is conducting a type of underground therapy group where the patient is planted with a chip in their brain, which is then underwater, and the patient is ultimately positioned to overcome their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window and runs with intention to death.)
This feeling of fear is addressed in the book as "the fight."
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic where it was about to be done through fire.
That's the complete expression I'm quite sure that the book was translated into French by a French author / author.
If this action is known to anyone, or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.

London - The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, will be faster to start COVID-19 vaccination campaigns because of the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases as compared to what has been previously recommended.
Every adults in England will already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by year-end, as since the second dose has been given至少有 three months ago, Johnson told his colleagues in a pre-recorded video message on Tuesday.
Until recently, the target date was set for January.
The British government would give additional support, damit the Impfungen also become more successful in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that one should beware of the Omikron-variant during a sudden storm, for reasons that require further investigation.
The good news is that increasing the Schutzniveau with a third vaccination could again be possible.
"Let's nowBoost!", said Johnson.

[CW] The feeling when I cannot help.
Content warning: I will be writing in details about human violence here.
I must simply write something from the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and witnesses) of domestic violence from my professional standpoint.
One topic that really binds me and is unfortunately much more common, is that many victims cannot help themselves and believe us not to be able to help them.
It's quite clear to me that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
However, there are less things in my profession that move me more than when I cannot do anything in such situations.
I see the blue lines, the blood, the feeling-free eyes...
But even in a discussion with four eyes, even with the attacker close in view and range, I cannot achieve all of them.
I'm not sure what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of crime, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of introducing the children to this place.
Ich would like to make it clear to everyone, especially those who are very close to the point of exhaustion, that all are worth living without暴力.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply bear violence.
I often wish that I could help in any way... I know that I cannot.
"However, it will never be better than that."
Please, always remember that you are valuable to live without violence, which is so crucial.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's next in the series compared to " League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complex names, a captivating theme: "Arcane", the latest series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, is now available on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two teams?
Basketball- bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei den Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was an offer.
No more: The earthquakes in Crailsheim have gone missing - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg trainer John Patrick had said with a look at the October Week-Three match at the Hakro Merlins in Crailsheim: "We still have some revenge in our bellies."
The has not gelegt after the game then but still increased due to the 61:72 (28:38) – reinstallment in the basketball league.
Although more than the nude result affected the nature and way of the approach.
"Stellvertretend betrug die Dreier-Quote nur nur 13 Prozent, 4 Treffer (allesamt von jungen Johannes Patrick) im sage und schreibe-Beweis 31 Versuche - stillgelegt?"
The answer provided by John Patrick was: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory in Teneriffa, and did not accomplish what we had trained for."
Specifically, moving the ball.
completely different reaction from Sebastian Gleim: "To Win a Clean Game for the second time against Ludwigsburg" said the happy coach.
It feels like before 10,000 people.
However, on Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came on their own terms.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and helped his team lead.
"The best player I have trained is still there," he offered still.
While members of Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7 points), failed to contribute throughout the series.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the robots prevent a total debate and were still back by only 8 points, after having already lost by 39:59.
Alongside Johannes Patrick,kam auch Justin Simon auf zwölf Punkte.
"Little time remains happily without."
Just past midnight (1900 hours), the Riesenbank Frankfurt will host the Skyliners, and up until then, there will be a maximum of 750 viewers in Ludwigsburg.

Likely translated to: "Just like from the egg: Max Raabe will be 59"  Note: This is a sentence from a German book about a 19th-century scientist named Max Raabe. It is not a common phrase in everyday language and its translation may vary depending on the context.
He vermag his Critics with new interpretations of songs from the 20th and 30th centuries to charm them.
Currently, he's on the program "Good Day, Good luck" - if he can come on board.
In reality, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this weekend.
But nothing will come from it.
The planned concert is scheduled to take place in May 2022, but it has been moved to "under the advice of authorities" to combat the COVID-19 virus.
Other seiner planned performances in the Advent season must also begin at once, as stated on the website of the singer who is 59 today and of his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
By January, the artists will then follow their already-January 2020封盘的日期.
Birthdate: 12 December 1962, city: Lüne, country: North German West Federal Republic (NFW-Fremd Republic)  Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962, in the North-West Federal Republic of Germany, where he was already a young adult who had done much and often.
He studied Operang Performance, and in 1986, together with colleagues, he founded the Opera House ensemble.
Since then, the Bariton has established himself with his skill set of songs and rhymes as a comedic Harmonist.
He was often praised for his achievements in numbers.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged"-reihe (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women, It's Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He made it into the mainstream from the mainstream.
Max Raabe, always dressed beautifully, with a clean-cut white hair tied securely and focused on the line, is no longer willing to participate in the current German musical landscape.
With the program "Good Day, happy life," he has been on a tour since 2020. dpa

Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: No new home is created through annexation.
The new Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz (SPD) has expressed her opposition to the merger of large housing cooperatives, as that is being requested in a Berlin people's decision.
"With a donation, there is no new home, only the owners' structure changes,” says Geywitz in an interview with The Tagesspiegel (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their lease will remain payable in the following years.
A black-and-white mix, such as private agents, clubs, or homeowner associations, is indeed the best protection against a dominant situation.
The coalition between SPD, Green Party, and the Linke Party in Berlin wants to organize a expert commission to discuss how to proceed with the result of the people's vote.
If the situation is not stable, Geywitz did not exclude the possibility of further discussion with the FDP in the Ampel-Koalition about further adjustments in the mortgage law.
The cooperative agreement sees a rent payment freeze until 2029, a limit on tenant demands in struggling housing markets, and the expansion of the rent variance.
I will speak with the justice minister to put this quickly and efficiently.
If the rent market doesn't yet recover, "we will talk to our colleagues about further steps," said the SPD politician.

"Meets兴城 100 Tote through Tornados in Kentucky"
At a nearby radar system, many Tornadoes have been launched by the United States.
Only in Kentucky could more than 100 deaths be rewarded.
These images from there remind of a war zone.
On the morning of Tuesday, several Tornadoes were engaged in serious accidents in the United States, and possibly up to 100 victims were sought.
The drones leave behind a大约 320公里 long stretch of operation, especially in Kentucky.
When Andy Beshear visited the Tornado's site, he said that everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just go.
parts of industries, databases are in the buildings.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible.
He is alone in Kentucky among up to 100 deaths, whose official numbers are growing steadily.

Firmen zahlen Impfpräprä曼 und ändern Werbesprüche.
While the Bundes Government continues to resist the idea of vaccines, businesses in Austria have taken the initiative and provided their customers with financial contribution options for the vaccination.
Therefore, they are on a line with the Social Partners, the ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, who today request financial incentives for implementation of vaccination.
Moreover, the transformation of shopping ads to Impfing calls - following the German model - will also increase the readiness for COVID-19 vaccines.

Help in the most private campaign.
Boron zum Grusse!
I am currently leading a trip for a group of 4 friends over the threshold pass and I want to actively participate in my own designed campaign for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big hook has been made, the weak points and their motivations documented, the individual act定制 and now I'm ready to write the mid-level adventure and start to troubleshoot about my own weapons at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a train with beef from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
There should be a development of the remaining behavior.
Some meters away from the village, a group ofgoblins will follow him and lock them in a secret room.
I want to give the player premium the ability to create different forms of confrontation: messaging, transactions, suffering, and early detection of any situation, regardless of how it affects the players.
Group strength: 8 conventionalgoblins, 2 with spears, 6 with weapons and shield.
The Goblins lead the hero in a slow path, surrounding him to every three sides and blocking the wheel while two stop the wheel with their spears.
If it comes to a battle and the heroes are involved, I have two solutions ideas.
1. The victims will be buried freshly and privately by the son of the village schoolmaster, a Halbelf, and will be taught and remembered.
The cart is indeed gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, this Halbelf, along with two of his opponents, risks diving into the fight and brings the protagonist to their aid.
The Karren is still there, everything is great.
How captivating are you in holding Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the encounter as a start to the adventure too much?
The group Goblins will play a significant role later on, therefore not only a vegetable vendor.
Edit: Wow, I didn't respond to so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I shall be guarantees that many of your ideas will be absorbed, and I now have even more trust in my narrative.

I'm frustrated by Sky Sports F1.
Hello F1 fans, over the season, the quality has been reducing on the German Sky, so I want to make a little bit of air using this post.
First of all, today in the F2-racing, the transfer was stopped at the end of the F1-race to allow for immediately starting the F1 commentary.
Although through the延缓 start and the start-up incident the time plan was slightly ahead of schedule, yet we would have been able to show the last planned ten minutes and the mastery decision (!) still.
It seems that, for legal reasons, F1 enjoys the priority and therefore must reduce everything else, so Sky DE here had no choice.
Nonetheless, despite Sky UK having given the fight over to the winner.
Nonetheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well-balanced the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was a recurrence of Reeling agreements between解说rs Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both knew not that one should change the gears under a red flag.
Although this situation existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone in this year, both teams came to the conclusion that it was necessary for Verstappen to change the drivers' bikes when there were corresponding bikes for this topic at Hamilton.
At Sky UK sowie RTL, bothCommentators knew immediately that there is this option for drivers.
I'm the belief that one should simply know such fundamental rules when reviewing the F1 on a Pay-TV provider.
It's not even the first reminder that is allowed or prescribed according to rules, both have constant uncertainty about rules.
Overall, the kününstelte Commentary-style of Roos does not align well with me, but allow me to note that it is the taste quality.
But there, even Heiko Wasser of RTL loves it more.
There are constantly occurring harmony that makes both of them appear unprofessional, just like the coffee cup selection scene from (also nameless) journalist Peter Hardenacke, or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Just this last one brings a lot of unhappiness into the comment, which he clearly does not understand.
Not only does the advertising stand still at Sky, but Sky is the only provider of advertising to the race直播. As you can listen to on F1TV, only the German audiopur without commentary comes out during the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising on the training than Sky and they are classified as Free-TV channels.
Although one must commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, simply doing so does not allow me to focus on the negative aspects.
The current program on Sky Sports F1 is also quite demanding and full of opportunities.
In total, Sky is really the worst foreign language channel that covers F1.
Unironically, RTL ensures that the advertising industry has a better job with the four races they can still offer.
Ultimately, the luxurious F1 season makes it significantly less fun than it would be possible with a smaller channel.

Hello, I sent an article that should have been shipped last week, but it still has not been shipped.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing has been done so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent tomorrow, and the Second Lady told me last night that she will check and send an email, and she has never answered.
Hello, I was hired on December 12, 19.
One of them has already addressed a fault (the substance has a hole on the lower part of the stand).
I'd like support.

It is also possible to set up a filter system over Luftheber.
This series will be offered in 3 variations to us.
Check at the end of the offer in the table.
There, you can see the results in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can put quite a few things together.
If you have a large aquarium, there are two or more pumps that can be used to allow multiple streams to enter.
The MK- Series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model, but also allows forLUFter pumps to be set up in the Aquarium, such as with a air column (find us in the shop) or with a device that converts the air cups into a function.
Here, one could refer to a scatologist, catholicism, or something similar.
The MK-Serie has a specialized, segmented construction and thus leads to reduced operating expenses.
The installation is very simple.
The Lüfter pump is connected using a 4/6 mm Luftschlauf to an ocean going vessel...and already it can be connected.
The Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü Lü).
If the Lüfter pump is set as deep as the water stand, one should place a return ventil.
Just穿越空气喉咙并在那里停留。
This would prevent this if water were to flow back towards the pump, which flows the water from the pool through the pump.
If the air pressure gauge is taken out of service during the day, you, like other air pumps, should be protected and cleaned from moisture.
The MK-trig series are pure energy packs that don't require much energy to use.
Even though we are offering the bearbeitungszeit with 3 days here on eBay, it will be packed daily and the packages will be taken here daily as well.
Everything is going well, it's very fast.
We will only take a bit of time to prepare, so that no one is surprised just because it has lasted for a little longer.
It would be like not everyone has understanding for all the colleagues who work also in the expedition team... actually, this does not make any sense with regards to COVID-19.
Please don't judge you negatively just because the delivery is taking longer, this is mainly due to the package handlers.
Of course, people love to hate on this service, even if we currently say... they have it pretty tough.

Amazon executive Bezo is sending his astronaut daughter and host to the universe.
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV journalist, and four others have undergone a short trip to the space.
They were transported on Saturday from the Raketensystem "New Shepard" of Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the short nine-minute flight occurred in the western region of the United States state of Texas.
Under the bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the freshly cooked astronauts upon their return to launch.
"Welcome back", said Bezos, dressed in a blue suit, as he opened the valve to the cabin.
With the applause of friends, family members and colleagues of Blue Origin, the six passengers ran after and after, embracing the Amazon leader.
According to Blue Origin, they were together for approximately 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of Alan Shepard, who was NASA's astronaut in 1961, and the 50-year-old TV personality Michael Strahan were employees of the company who had paid for the other four participants' tickets: space traveler Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much did they pay for their tickets, Blue Origin did not provide that information.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered after the short flight the mission of her father.
He must work hard at his assignments and make things alone.
She was just floating around, she said with a smile, 74-year-old.
Even Michael Strahan expressed himself with enthusiasm.
The English translation for this sentence is: "He would rather go back to the all, said the host."
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers.
The aircraft system "New Shepard" is fully automated.
The boat-borne column reached a height of around 100 kilometers over the earth, temporarily with软实力， before returning to land by large riversine platforms.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts view 100 kilometers over the Earth as the boundary to the universe, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned All-Ausflug of Blue Origin: At the first flight in July, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was onboard along with his brother, Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old大陆子女.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was among the two actors who made headlines worldwide with their roles in "Star Trek", along with former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, partner Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's chief operating officer Audrey Powers.
Criticizers suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to proceed with space tourism activities significantly without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without focus on the climate.

"Extra Stress vor Ferien & Feiertag-Wochenenden"
This topic came up last week.
I now have to use my long weekend to get relaxed.
"Darum erst jetzt ein Pfosten dazu."
Not only during large festivals like Christmas, there is great stress in the workplace.
It seems there is also this option during meals plus the bridge.
It was just like that: Last week, Mariä Himmelfahrt was the name of the flight we referred to in Switzerland as "Auffahrt".
On Friday, most people and businesses make a weekly meeting, which is semi-official.
Last week, also, there was a long 4-day-weekend at home.
Was ging also letzte Woche?
" Überall Stress"
Translate: Unlock any e-mail messages that must be done before departure, task here task there, all *especially* during the long weekend.
il... ja weil?
Because "NEXT week then" sounds suspicious after so much time, it cannot be.
Or because the people will learn so much in a normal week than in a stressful one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also deeply pressured.
What will this individual's operation be due to婚礼？
Why would we then have another birthday if we can't give them enough?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very self-centered there.
My question is simply: Are we just the Swiss?
Is this your reformulated evangelical art?
Or do you know that too in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld ist wunderbar auf Weihnachten in Thüringen.

They will consensus on the festival by backing and pushing each other with their son.

Until the bedtime, they still have some things to accomplish: "I still have no resume, I must now start fresh."

The DDR-handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, which was in use in境界 and Central Europe, is likely to have come from the model development proposal of ME Heft 11/1968. It was built using holes and missing parts, see photos, function good. The building code E 95 is a seriousware transport console of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the transportation of harder than average fuels in the Central European network. It is possible that the building also came from the small company ZschutsCHKE and BACHMANN.
One train car is located in DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being restoration at the present time.
The German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had been assigned 1924 to submit plans for a diesel-powered train, which it believed could increase the capacity of 2,200-tonality cars and 530-tonality people cars on this route to 45 km/h travel speed with a diesel engine.
As the highest speed was requested, it was 65 km/h.
Therefore, the DRG in March 1926 determined the delivery of a 1’Co+Co1’ train car with Tatzlager-Antrieb AEG and the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six cars containing the business numbers E 95 01-06 was accomplished.
Alles Überstanden den second world war, und danach fanden sich wieder auf dem Territorium der lateinamerikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikanikan
In 1946, the train cars were considered as compensation in the Soviet Union.
They traveled back to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the functionality of the six场上 was declared.
[4] As the progress of reelerating the mittelmitteldeutsche network increased, the three cars E 95 01 to E 95 03 were patched in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as substitute donors.
However, initially the larger pages, which were E04, E44, and E94, were prioritized.
Once the E-94 was exhausted, as it was unable to improve the work rate further, the E-95 came into focus.
[4] At first, the trains were stopped at the Leipzig-Wahren Bahnbetriebswerk.
You arrived 1960 at the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P.
They were mostly used before芝士场ügen (geiseltal) in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt in a private upload plan.
The English translation for this sentence is: The complex pricing system of the cars is becoming increasingly problematic with age.
So it came up again that students would stay behind in the corridors.
Then the constantly driving Beimann with a Hammer and Holzkeil must trigger the sword during the journey again.
The English translation for this sentence is: damage to the carriage motors occurred frequently and led to prolonged breakdowns in the train.
[5] Since there were sufficient new fuel-efficient cars available at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of the electric vehicle market was planned then, the Reichsbahn couldn't refuse to operate older cars and most Split-gate classes, thus placing the E 95 in a serviceable position.
Furthermore, it was with them that the German Reichsbahn wanted to travel only in single-engine mode, which would have caused a problem in the operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machinery and view perspectives from the driver's stand.
[5] After being established in early 1969, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were the last to be disconnected, and as such, E 95 01, which quitted the service on October 5, 1970.
The previously scheduled new ID number 255,001 has not been used.
Alle Lokomotiven until the E 95 02 were removed.
The E 95 02 was installed as an alternative for the future museum train E 77 10 as heating equipment on the Haupt Hauptbahnhof, Halle.
It took some time before the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was worth collecting as a museum car.
In 1979, the initial expressed goal was to present the locomotives to a train show at RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since been added to the Dresden Traffic Museum as a non-functional museum train.
In 1986, the inner completion of the train was accomplished.
At the DB Museum in Halle (Saale), the train is being prepared for the museum.
From 1995, members of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational maintenance of the train.
In April 2015, the train was first presented at a display in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer insulation, where the transformers were checked and five train motors were operating-able.
The train cars were in use on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and the adjacent side tracks until 1945, where they were preferred due to their favorable operation and lower maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were transported to the middle German network after Leipzig.
第一个指令区域先是 Schlesien。
The English translation for this sentence is:  The handarbeitsmodell H0 in OVP is doing well, it is necessary to perform optional maintenance on the unit in owner work, and it has been logged with Spielspure, Kellergeruch!, very rare handarbeitsmodell, very small scope- maybe it comes from the small company Zschutschke and BACHMANN.
The packaging can include edges and containers.
Yes, the F-Team are them.
I have a bed for you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle shelf is held by two feet, but unfortunately, these are too short and the shelf cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The Mittelbalken is held by two arms, however, these are currently produced错误的.
The middle-sized button doesn't fit into the pre-determined button hole.

These are, according to the montage instructions, the correct forms, they were only too small.
But that's okay.
Hauptsache sie了她的目标。
For this sentence, the translation is: "For me, they are not flat."
Could I receive this addressed?
Hello #NAME#, would you like me to explain the problem again?
A homebranding with two broken bones and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured during a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
Moreover, an estimated damage of 500 million euros was reported in the seven-tentatively European region, as the police made aware on Tuesday.
The fire had probably originated from a carport and spread to the nearby house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Saturday morning with serious  rumor injuries.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not come from a pre-existing fire investigation.
The police station at Fortfeldbruck has completed the remaining investigations.
Then she will come again.
And I still need to pay for distribution.
To combat fake news, Biontech CEO reveals funding picture
Uğur Şahin shared a photo of his first exercise in February 2021 on the social network LinkedIn.
The English translation for this sentence is: Biontech's CEO, Uğur Şahin, has yet to publicly address his fitness status.
Now the employer releases a photo showing his COVID-19 training.
The illness of one of his friends had moved him, source said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo that shows how he receives an vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information in the social media that I actually wasn't injected.
"Wensch findet sich die Biontech-Pfizer-ImpfstoffEins购买程序", findet Şahin am 十几enabend auf LinkedIn.
"Fortiven Monaten drängen mich herzlich好友们， ein Foto von mir zu posten, auf dem ich geImpft werde, um diesen falschen Gerüchten entgegenzuwirken."
He has rejected it because the communication should not focus on him alone.
But a call in the previous week had changed his perspective: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old schoolmate of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 infection and has been using a breathing apparatus for three weeks.
The teacher said, "The schoolmate and his family were not kidnapped," etc.
He asked not about the reasons.
The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often perpetuated by incomplete or false information and mistrust.
Angst ist nur schwer mit Fakten bekämpft, manchmal kann es besser sein, diese Erfahrungen zu teilen.
An internet is spreading an interview with the German Shepherd, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not injected.
However, the video became available in December 2020, just as Germany's public opinion was clear.
"对我而言，目前来说，拿到疫苗本身还不符合规定。"，伊凡·Şahin在当时说。
There is a priority for the elimination of the脊椎动物的手术。
However, the priority has been long raised - and the Biontech CEO has challenged himself to calculate the priority three times based on various sources.
"Fuer in Umspannanlage: Zhntausende Menschen ohne Strom"   = "Fuer in Umspannanlage: 数以万计的人没有呼吸机"  This sentence describes the situation of people without access to oxygen therapy in a foreign country due to COVID-19 pandemic.
On Friday evening, lights were out in several cities in Nordrhein-Westfalen: no power and in many cases, no heating also.
A brand had hit aspannstation.
After one accident with severe damage on an Umspannstation in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in Nordrhein-Westfalen, 1000 people in the region need to be without power for up to 24 hours.
Following the fire at midnight on Friday, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several cities left the lights off.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous Notstromaggregate were in operation until the large-scale stroke was completely removed by the late afternoon.
Fire lookouts and volunteer firemen and women of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities distributed job training programs and called for neighborly assistance.
The provider thanked the clients for their dedication and the witnesses for their contribution.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
"We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire engines, and the THW for the unrelenting effort," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday.
The repairs of the damages would take some time, he explained, since the Westnetz-Monteure initially only started working temporarily again.
A technical failure led to the outbreak at the company.
"Strom fließt wieder" is a German phrase that roughly translates to "stream flows again" or " waterfalls continue".
The盆蒸站(Westnetz)表示，周六下午19点15分发生的洪水已显著损坏了 Neunkirchen-Seelscheid 站( Umspannstation)的10,000吨储备能力。

With the help of these bypassings, the electricity supply will be back.
Since Saturday at 18 hours, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity back.
Additional 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were already scheduled to be shifted gradually starting at 21:30.
Since 23:15 hours, also until then, the still affected by the incident Stream would have been available.
More than 80 Monteure von Westnetz and partner firms were in use.
The authorities had called for neighborly help after the construction of a Notstromversorgung for important buildings on Saturday morning.
"Now, it's important that the Bürgerinnen and Bürger consult with their neighbors, especially elderly or alone people, and inform the local fire-fighting stations of any needs for assistance," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a conference.
During the installation and operation of Notstromaggregates, especially the inhabitants of Altenheimen stood in the focus.
Furthermore, according to government officials, there have been newly established feeding clinics in schools for those who couldn't afford to feed themselves or who require large medical equipment specifically for medical treatment.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the decking is out of stock in Germany.
Can I buy them and pay for them with Euros?
It's about the daily deck #PRS_ORG# in Blaugrün.

I would be delighted about a reply.
Yes, that is really simpler!
Then we do it!
Could you send me the return ticket via email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already attempted something like this before the chat.
However, during the purchase, I had not started the E-#PRS_ORG# again.
Will ich das jetzt tun?
I find a so low reward very disappointed.
Therefore, we are not understanding each other.

So, if I wanted to open it, the message will come, ups!
This document couldn't be opened.
The sentence in English is: "The file is possibly incorrect, please report it to the customer service."
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# Epub file.

The dark could otherwise come in later.
Metalltöne und Metallicfarben kommen ganz zum Schluss mit einer separaten Pinsel.
Otherwise, it can lead to beautiful metal highlighting when they mess with normal colors.
Please stack the newly cleaned parts one day before you move them.

More important than the right tools like rubber bands, pins and clips is spending time, maintaining focus, and having a steady hand.
Break every needed decimal individually and place them right.
Decals are also called Watercolor paintings because you can briefly wet your back side with water until the Tray paper becomes dark through the strokes.
Then you should cut the image just a small piece from the paper and put the piece on the corresponding line on the model (which you also fixed before).
While holding theDecal on the model with a tool, take the trainer paper directly away.
Watch out: Please first check whether the picture is correctly placed before you put it completely on the paper, so that it does not bind to the finger, curl, or even fall off.

"Attention not suitable for children under 3 years old"
I can open a book only briefly, once I look at something else, I cannot read the book and must login and register again, and download the book and search for the page until I have read it.
I'm already having a conversation with you on Monday.
Ich bekomme diesen per Email.
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp was already in 3 separate packages at my side.
Thank you, but please note that the English translation for "ok trotzdem vielen Dank!" is somewhat unconventional, as it does not follow typical English grammar. A more standard translation would be "Again, thank you!" or "Thank you again!"
Then, I'll buy from someone else as soon as the money is back.
I'm getting this, but I'm not entirely sure what you're asking for. Could you please clarify or provide more context?
Kinderwunschbehandlung bei PKV / What is a "customer retention"?
"HALLO zusammen!"
We were some time in child-friendly treatment, now that it's regarding the agreement with the PKV, this child is suddenly standing up for herself.
After that:
We had requested the child-friendly activity at the PKV in advance and received the usage agreement over 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time-window, success, etc.).
The first attempt directly led to the successful birth and was reviewed by the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to bring another child, and we went through 2 ( unsuccessful) attempts, but these did not meet the PKV criteria yet.
We Again request the cost assistance from the PKV and are again submitting 3 additional attempts.
After several attempts (we have conducted more attempts than promised, logically, the most expensive ones should be covered by the PKV) we send the payments to the PKV and achieve the悄悄地 surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only require 3 attempts.
The reason: After pregnancy/ childbirth, the remaining two attempts of the first call will fail.
The second kindest gift is a new source of comfort.
According to the AGB, "The guarantee period starts with healing treatment, and ends when treatment liability no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be processed) or us (it is necessary to provide 5 attempts)?
Had the PKV required us to be told that with pregnancy, the further attempts would fall?
Is the desire for a second child truly a new source ofcherried?
The capability (except for through separated adults) will not be trained by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could hear your perspective.
Thank you very much for your help!
Could you please send me the three options via email and let me know how I can best handle them?
In order.
We won't be making any further offerings to you.
When they add the addresses of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have effectively lost good customers.
They should send it to their manager.
That is not Wettbewerbsfähig.

I'm not sure what I can do to make the cursor completely disabled in front of me.
Please see the screenshot what the colleague has written.
There is clear and evident that the payment has been authorized, and I still have not received any payment through #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have lost two original customers.

These products will be purchased in addition to the required pots, but we unfortunately cannot find them at your store.

Week's Theme: The Best Low Budget Movies
What is a low-budget film exactly, there is no exact definition with specific budget limits.
Wikipedia has said something about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net, you can find many lists of low-budget films, such as at Letterboxd.com.

"Hallo" is the German word for "hello".
The English translation for this sentence is: "The advance against Minsk with high costs for the EU."
The EU can declare a "half- victory" in the conflict with the Brazilian regime, according to the Politik expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs were, however, very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to the border with Poland andaitun, said Bossong, the Evangelical Pressedienst (epd).
The EU had not resolved the confrontation, according to the scientist of the Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This sentence in English translates to: "This薯饼困境 - Belarus doesn't seem very small, but the EU feels like a winner - it's still going far beyond."
Bossong declared that the interaction with the people on the border was not in line with the European Union's Menschenrechtskonvention.
Today, it appears that there is a "slowly growing normalization ofbacks" among individual EU governments.
Since the EU is not genuinely united against itself, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development is also challenging the cohesion of the Union.
It seems that they cannot make any progress, if a member state sets its head in making its thing, as it is the case with Poland, which even allows the EU's空间保护 agencyFrontex to access the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays a additional fee for its policy towards the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A fundamental agreement on the issue of immigration policy would be frustrated, as the line " Grenzschutz, Grenzschutz, Grenzschutz" has been strengthened.
Erneuter Versuch der Grenzüberschreitung
According to Poles' border closures, lately immigrants have been trying to pass through toPOLnish territory again.
On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the government said that 55 immigrants had been arrested in the overnight hours on Tuesday and taken to the border.
The Polish officers were at the time near Czeremsza were beaten up by the immigrants with stones.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and needed medical treatment from a military doctor.
Insgesamt registrierte dergrenzschutz 52 versuchte Grenzübertritte within 24 hours.
Just before Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed over the border barrier.
Many people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU puts Alexander Lukaschenko as the ruler of Minsk, with the intention of forcing him to admit the country to the EU.
波兰s und Lituanian presseberichten zogen Grenzabschnitte ab.
The EU sanktionated Belarus and threatened airlines that would bring immigrants and refugees to the country.
Additionally, EU Commissioners visited countries of the people's origin to facilitate travel.
Bossong said that the most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines.
Here's the English translation of the sentence: "Therefore, the EU has placed its market power in the Waagschale and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh regulations and territorial sanctions."
Minsk should also consider internal political costs.
The Russian society was not aware that the security infrastructure regularly attracts thousands of people through the land.
Mercedes protests after umstrittenem Formula 1-Finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen will have started two regulation breaches during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has confirmed an entry.
The silver pages suspect two rules breaches at the last Grand Prix of the year.

Verstappen had already crossed Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and was just ahead of his first Formula 1 title.
The vehicle came into operation just after the end of a Safety-Car phase, during which the Niederländer's driving vehicle had beenOVERheated.
I'm checking that.
I'm going to talk to the bank and call you back again.
Thank you for the support.

早在20世纪90年代初， already since the early 1990s, there is cooperation between the Bundeslignant and the free time park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg fantag at the Europa Park, it had shown again how well the partnership works.
"我们看到一起享受走廊乐趣的球迷，这会增加这种感觉", says Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In der Gemeinde Krembz women are searching for Christmas trees.
Landwirt Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations at theTannenverkauf.
One day, a man will even go home without his partner because they couldn't get along.
Every year, he cultivates about 2,000 pieces.
However, the 56-year-old has already experienced somecoreose situations.
He says that it makes the nightlife always exciting.
And what about the Gutschein?
" Sonst bin ich als Kunde weg?! " is an English translation for the sentence " Sonst bin ich als Kunde weg?! " which means " But then how am I as your customer?! "
"Despite having received a defective delivery, I am now paying the full price."
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to conduct any discussions about the better judge, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat, which is grilled on a rotatingslice.
And both have their own names.
In German, something like "Dreher" could be an equivalent, which to be honest doesn't sound so good.
"Probleme mit Glasfaser + Devolo DLan/Magic" translates to "Problems with Glass Frame + Devolo DLan/Magic" in English.
We have since a few weeks had a new glass fiber connection in the house.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Before that, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLA, which had received and sent 50 Mbit on demand.
The new glass Fiber connection sends 500 MB to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module which is connected to the FritzBox, also comes up.
However, the other DLan module which connects the wifi, no longer sends the full 500 codes, but the more I connect to the module in my house, the less comes through (so I use a bag that has 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module positioned far away).
This sentence means "That is why with the new glass fiber connection, the internet is now even longer than before (about 45 Mbit) in the first stock."
I also received a new Deolo Magic Set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here also there were similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why with a glass fiber network so much internet speed is lost over the network connection?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely necessary to send the LAN cable to that house still.
I'm really confused, why have I created an extra account here?
Therefore, I would be much more delighted about an answer.
When is it time to switch the bike loan?
Who thought, now that it's finally quiet at the train stations, they're getting lost.
While many banks used the spring season to revisit and adjust previous fees with their clients using various techniques, the free bills for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
The German Bank, for instance, was found to be relatively large with a limit of 100,000 Euro.
Now she has just reduced the free balance and even changed the threshold for the daily charge.
In einem ersten Schrittritt wird die Grenze only for customers of the Conference-based Postbank changed - updated to 50,000 Euro for Giro and Anlagekonten, and to 25,000 Euro for everyday payment accounts.
Currently, these smaller free transactions are applicable for the entire German Bank, as a representative on inquiry confirmed.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly negotiated individual agreements with vendors."
The Commerzbank was already going over a limit of 50,000 Euro, which still applies, just like with the ING Germany.
The popular full-service bank DKB has reduced the free accounts to two levels, first from 50,000 Euros to now 25,000 Euros.
Furthermore: More than 100 banks, according to data from Verivox, now have a free credit of 25,000 Euro or less.
also die Sparda-Bank Berlin ist bei 25.000 Euro angekommen：黑白 genau mit meiner russischen Familie ging es häufig die russische wähähler朴实 daran, meine Wähählung erfolgreich an die Sparda-Bank zu erfolgen, und wir sprechen auch immer die Wählung an meinem Wunschgefinden an. Was erfolgreich erreicht haben wir die Sparda-Bank Berlin, die es weit besser erwartest ist, die Wähählung an meinem Wunschgefinden erfolgreich anzuerkann.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutions should even consider providing retunings - for the case that also the secondary institutions should demonstrate that negative terms are essentially unpayable and many millions of clients must be paying.

Jennifer Aniston is engaged to a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of the Hollywood ladder.
But your life is nothing but a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) wurde vom US-Magazin "The Hollywood Reporter" zur einflussreichsten Frau des Jahres gewählt.
For her, who caused great excitement in 2021 by重新启动《 Friends 》并继续进行他们系列《 The Morning Show 》,this success in first place is mainly the result of much discipline and hard work.
"To view your appearance, a whole army of assistants, consultants and trainers is involved."
Despite this, so Aniston, they could give themselves a chip at night (yes, correctly: a original chip from the deck).
It is actually a wonder that the hearts of both genders of fans still follow verbatim.
Maybe because she has a lack of happiness - and still searching for the great love.
And the baby dance has been removed from the list.
Before, she was constantly asking how she would become a mother.
"Das schmerzte sie."
The people who asked that question have no idea what's going on personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really unfair.
It is important to hope that success and peace also make happy.
Unwürdiges Ende einer Karriere: Räikkönen muss aufgegeben werden
Kimi Räikkönens Abschied aus der Formula 1 verlief noch leiser als gedacht.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his shoes and flexed his wrist.
That was it.
After a mistake and a long train journey, drivers must not only take the middle of the ranndistanz to avoid accidents but also must bring their Alfa Romeo to the station in Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, as the "Iceman"结束他在赛车岭岭的职业生涯。
Upon her departure, also her husband Minttu and the two children were still staying in the United Arab Emirates.
The greatest success of Rachmaninoff's career was the win in the 2007 World Chess Champion title in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand-Prix battles, 18 of them starting from the Pole and reaching the lead up to 103rd place. dpa
Friedrich has scored 60 goals. The Weltcupsieg has taken place -lte has scored in the second round of the World Cup - sport.
The goal of the Bobpilot is to achieve the mark of Norwegianbiathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories.
"I've calculated it, I need to win no less than half a dozen games per season, then I Could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double-OlympiaOlympia participant from Oberbärenburg, who took two victories in just two days at the Winterberg tournament.
At first, he was dissatisfied with the attack by Johannes Lochner on Friday, where he went from rank three to rank one.
Then he changed some of the material configuration and started a journey on Sunday with 0.30 minutes of travel at a higher speed.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he set himself up against the British player Brad Hall.
The third person became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We are going to be more risky today and get paid," said Friedrich, who also launched his 22nd attempt at the series.
The English translation for this sentence is: The driven Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was traveling for Stuttgart, arrived earlier this time at rank five.
The English translation for this sentence is: Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed after class four in the first race on position eight.

The English translation for this sentence is: Second-place winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Germany joined Germany's fastest relay team, Alexandra Burghardt fromburghausen, in the second position.
She took the first floor after her Olympia certification this winter.
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig landed on stage three.
For me, it was super cool to be the first opponent in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama gets to meet me.
I'm very excited about the development.
"There is still much potential at start-up, but today's start-up times were okay," said Burghardt, and emphasizing, "It's not only about turning on, but there is also a lot going on nearby."
Jamanka不要抱怨那些不完全准确的旅行，但他指出：“它走对的方向。”

Hello, beautiful young girls and women,
I have something I just want to write and maybe it will be okay for one or another...
I'm 24, I have KPTBS, I'm a full-time student and a cat mom - although my cat doesn't cry or go to kindergarten, he actually is 1 to 1 with my kid.
My friend (who is together since 6 years old) is sick, he has surgery today and has been depressed (but now is in therapy).
I had visited him last week because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we spent a lot of time fooling around and it was quite fun.
I've helped him with the translation (because language is in the partnership with translation).
He is out of bed now and we see each other less (1-2 times a week) which makes it very difficult for me to achieve my goals of love and affection.
My dog is having a heart attack, I've been helping him out and now he's lying in his couch, he's feeling a little relaxed after I was there with the wagging and scratching for him.
I am living alone with my sister and mother, and they are away for a month now.
Now it's also coming up to us to divide the housework among us, which we will naturally do.
But even cooking is quite satisfying for me...
My TB disease is currently quite well-controlled, I am still under treatment and am able to come back to work.
Not bad, but I'm close and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university requires quite a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't done anything and then tomorrow morning there is anatomie class for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I'll have a mid-week test on Wednesday, and what comes then will be in my schedule and not in my head because there's no more space.
Also, my week goes on like this: only until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then everything goes back to normal.
"Only until the birth day."
"Only until beginner's班开始."
"Nur noch bis Wochenende" Translate to English as "Only until next week."
Nur noch bis...
And so, this is continuing forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual parameters, because otherwise, I pack it down.
I somehow feel guilty and "chaotic," but I cannot make it different...
How is it like that for you?
"True, I am extremely grateful that I need not work."
Ich bin wirklich unendlich dankbar, dass ich das nicht in Worte fassen kann.
I don't know if I had Over Learning 障碍 (Overlearning Disorder) before.
I believe that this also has some connection to the mental load of women, and therefore I believed that I would find here some true dear friends...
Ich wünsche euch auf jeden Fall noch einen erholsamen Abend, die Woche ist fast geschafft!
I received my order today, butUnfortunately, the other color plus the top is twisted and the table stand has taken compression.

What can you offer me?
Wenn wir now den Tisch tauschen werden, bekomme ich noch andere Farbe oder wie?
The email requesting storage was sent on the 26th of December, #NUMBER#.
In addition, two more times.
She wasn't confirmed yet.
Something completely different: I while back in school, I realized that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it's just a additional skill like math or astronomy for them.
For me, this was always strange, perhaps because I was Christian- convert and I always had this strange belief.
How are you?
Perhaps you can also tell about your work-and-study colleagues with different attitudes.
Ultimately, I understand the distinction between private and professional, and it is beneficial to separate them.
"Is there also a learning plan, etc."
But it's actually quite unusual to have a physicist who doesn't believe in relativity theory.
What brings someone then to want to learn religion if they do not believe in it?
礼仪重要还是什么都不重要？
"hoffe es ist兴投入你的问题并不是私人的."
Can it not be changed or not? Please translate it in English, I understand it well.
That's already quite long, then I would be潜行离去。
"Is it good, thank you."
I am eagerly waiting for a reply as soon as possible until the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support, #NAME#.
" filmsuche Hilfe bitte" 的 English translation is "Please watch me doing work".
Hello, lovelies.
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I'm convinced it's a film for teenagers.
In the movie there are two seasons (or parallel worlds).
Zum einen die Moderne (reale Welt).
Among other things, the past (or the realm of the dead) is not entirely clear.
Because I cannot understand it further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the cross of Karibik).
Due to some reason the path splits and it results in a decision.
The protagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who will bring women into this kingdom so that they can live. I am.
I believe this is also the grave site of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers will fight against each other.
If you say something to me, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little has slept only on the waist since week 1.
Fast forward: still sleeping:D
Embrace you.
So one child holds much more than one thinks.
Carefully ensure that everything around is okay, no cushion rolls, come back a few times to check, but no further monitoring needed.
That does you a whole lot!
"Fresh air in the room."
"Gute Matratze" is a German phrase that means "good Matratze" or "good noodles."
No戴口罩。
Oh so and ours had no sleep bag, but already had a deck.
Watch your child while he's sleeping.
What does the subject "es" do to the head of the table?
Can something express itself from the waist up?
Or is it located directly above the matress?
Can you enable, if everything is in order?
We are also all grown up and when my husband comes to the world, it's clear and it can be that you put the kids on your lap to sleep.
Additionally, we are already "hometown" to you and have already ordered many articles.

RBTV has done much homework.
And indeed, I know that not everything can be achieved.
And I had also much fun with RBTV.
Simply, it's just that the news of this channel is now under all the Sau.
almost every format is responding (OK), but then still going on large Betteltour.
It was said that one was a "unique" Internet sender.
Translates to: "Arno said: One should not be a "latent leaf node"."
Was ist man jetzt?
A 0815 spam sender is trying to bring his生物多样性(Billo Merch) to the elite fan.
And then we have still Marahs "Do's" and "Don'ts."
The naturally apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
The people should definitely help each other.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking empathy and is taking the饱和 rooms on the outbreak instead, is attempting to make soup.
How should one find all that?
It's quite impressive that it interests you, I really find it quite impressive.
I would like to request a call because my exported wooden table was delivered damaged.

With the everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design, there's no problem!
20 liters Fassungsvermögen can also handle larger photo- usage without any problems, which can be safely stored with the encrypted FlexFold servers.
And what you still need for everyday circumstances, remains well organized and separated from photo制片 technology thanks to practical connections in the individually configured internal space.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the previous series is still presented in a new look.
The desired, minimalist design is truly integrated - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the inner side of the backpack while still allowing for quick photo processing in the morning.
This function is achieved with two possibilities: one legally over the decimal key that can be closed with the MagLatch-Verschlusssystem, and a highly effective solution for comprehensive protection that has already been incorporated in the messenger bags.
Meanwhile, there is a metal strap attached to the front side of the backpack with suitable hooks.
Unlike many rapid coverage situations, Peak Design has关注不同的“填充结构"：事实上，有4个稳定创新的板，可以在过滤器上安装。
If the backpack is full, just take the top button, it's usually empty, and a deeper one.
Contact closure and休憩 point are also magnetic.
So can the backpack also be booked explicitly, without leaving the mind open.
The second option is also fundamentally different from other, photo credit backpacks: alongside the Deckelklappe, there is also a side熱口紋放 on both sides of the backpack.
This sentence is in German and it means: "This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of accessing content from the top - you no longer need to scan the content!"
Moreover, this clever detail increases the all-day variety of the backpack significantly: not only does one not only wear their camera gear, but also applies daily amenities or travel luggage.
In your everyday backpack, you can customize theInside space (more info here) and easily store both items together - and also use the both side openings independently.
Therefore, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards the body, so for example, you can put on the camera armor in the right side top section while the everyday items stay safely in the left backpack side section and do not come between.
"Help! Uncomplized, interconnected puzzles will be helpful."
And because the exterior shell of the backpack is also made completely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant plastic, then the content itself will be dry when it goes to Switzerland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I was constantly waiting for your support's email.
"#NAME# sent me a email yesterday containing congratulations for the hiring."

#Where is the post here?
If one looks closely at the active behavior in the past months of Monday morning, one can conclude that it is not Extritten.
We are arrival in a winterstarre and have transformed the summer pond over some months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, where is it?
Most likely, this is connected to our unhappiness, as here some things are happening and we generally stand here.
In the past days, there has been a growing feeling that many of them still have a lot of support for the MBundestag.
"Was wir müssen ändern"
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asking what one wants to keep this day for a lifetime.
The request came from u/edizVEVO, who has been increasingly active on this project in the past days and has discovered a, simply put, dark channel.
After some back-and-forth, several members of the community have found themselves with the desire to build the project again.
Moreover, I would like to explicitly call upon all to participate, only so can this project have a future stand.
We have created this discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange information, and work on specific things together.
You can connect to the server over this link.

How do you respond to the question of why are you vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague who I enjoy very much.
She herself has been vegetarian for a while, and at the current moment is also very rarely eating meat.
I myself was previously some years a vegetarian.
Upon asking if I had always intended to be vegan and whether veganism was a planned intermediate step, I had responded honestly without much further consideration.
And indeed, I longed to support the animal well-being as a vegetarian, but eventually I realized and understood that I thereby support animal exploitation.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I felt the feeling that there was Missmut on her side, she then rejected veganism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegan, we could reduce animal suffering.
Now I ask myself if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan, you're quickly pushed into a corner and come up against conflicts without ever considering it.
It depends on the context and the meaning of the sentence. If the sentence is about a vegan who is harmonious, then the translation would be "It respects a harmonious vegan." If the sentence is about the act of greeting a vegan, then the translation would be "It greets a harmonious vegan."
It does not involve a special exception according to section 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not bind you to the company's requirements for the transmission.
I am the last day on which #PRS_ORG# has not taken my property out of storage.
Since I cannot be present for a wedding at the moment, it also cannot be changed inadvertently.

"After the 01.02.#NUMBER#, I'm back again."
The English translation for this sentence is: "Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Retention: 45,000 Euro Zuschuss from the Land."
Recently, the莱茵-Hinf内斯内斯 Minister of Interior, Roger Lewentz, reached out to the Lahnsteiner Rathaus to provide a高达 45,000 Euro loan for the new device for water treatment of the Freewillig Feuerwehr Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle that is in use since November 2020, believe to be 135,000 Euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am glad to hear that the state of Rheinland-Pfalz is supporting us here." says Peter Labonte, Oberbürgermeister of Lahnstein.
The device is used by the Lahnstein team, which consists of seven teams in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfill duties in the water and ice retention, as well as the technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one compares the situation gradually with rising attendance: The Boom of Hotelschifffahrt on Rhein and Mosel, as well as the gradually increasing use of the Lahn as a seasonal flight point, add to this.

First of all, thank you for making me the entire matter here. I have also spent nearly a year in the state department in a similar task, speaking of which, we were also waffaffants in the executive branch, and I do not want to go into that!
I find the question of rights and links always very concisely handled.
Ultimately, one should say that naturally the controller of the state comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Linken, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, even in the case of wearing distinctive clothing and weapons, it should be clear to everyone that this would make them vulnerable to conservative magic, and it should also be clear to everyone that these people would be difficult to communicate with in the real world. You, of course, have many German people with Migrationshintergrund, women, and even Homosexuelle (and I'm not talking about the over-the-top feminine stereotypes, because those are relatively rare in the practical realm, but rather normal men and women who won't be mentioned unless they choose to tell you about it). And I can and must leave these people, because in any case, they will return your life or set it up for you.
But even these marginal groups, although it may seem absurd from my experience that they possess a conservative attitude, speak highly of Germany and feel rather less treated by over-zealous left-wing politics, even if this politics truly seeks to do them justice and say it is theirs to be addressed, they will simply want to be treated as normal.
Moving on to the rights, because naturally police and activists are also a part of society, you will also find extreme rightists here. However, allowing these to freely express their opinion here, even if it's against the state-owned platforms, is quite far-fetched and personally, it bugs me.
Of course, it comes up that even police and soldiers who often went on international missions often began to speculate based on negative experiences, and even said things that were controversial until they were technically accurate.
It also comes into play that, perhaps, even some red-hot mental opponents may engage in a game of thought-provoking brainstorming.
Nevertheless, something about my perspective is being well-effectively challenged and also benefiting from political education and clarification throughout!
Germany is so deeply integrated into international politics that it's not even funny, according to my perspective, that we could not even stand to have good-hearted racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand what I've purchased, but I've also purchased the other product on the German website.

I am very organized and structured when it comes to work (I am alone, have very little free time), but already in my life I am not getting enough to properly run my home efficiently and comfortably.
There are always phases where everything remains put, and then and when I pack up and move on.
But it's not actually "that someone might actually visit".
My partner is ( unfortunately) not better, it affects me somewhere but most of the time, the house-hold budget is losing against work and greed.
The kitchen will still be freshly cleaned since we love to cook.
Now to my question, have you made it a goal to become more involved with your children?
We have nothing, but we are working on it and this question has been affecting me longer.
because for me, I don't have any encouragement, it just doesn't help me to feel down, especially when there's no visitors and/or fresh clothing and the kitchen is available.
Has a person with a child experienced a larger influence or remains isolated?
Please follow my response.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-unconscious personality?
I have completed a training course in the field of software development and am now aged about one year.
Unfortunately, I still feel that this position is not the right fit for me, so I have been considering starting over and studying social work again.
The English translation for this sentence: "The problem: I have a selbstunsichere (or ängstlich vermeidende) personal connection (ÄVPS)."
That means very simply that I don't have a self-worth feeling and indeed, I am quite confidential.
I have no problem talking to people on a serious basis, but it's very difficult for me to conduct private conversations and I've been told repeatedly that I'm unnahbar (which I believe I've become better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather work, especially in search assistance or family assistance, than as a streetworker or in an open-ended youth program.
However, I still don't know if the actual work day is really like what I am seeing it for myself, and it is difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is causing problems in my job (emotionally for me), because it always pulls me down when something is wrong with my code ("even the simple things are getting complicated again") and it's hard for experienced colleagues to give me help ("I should really learn how this works"/"I'm not sure how to ask him out of work"/"he must be holding me back really" etc.).

Hello r/LegaladviceGerman.
I have following problem.
On our homepage, a Walnuss tree should be planted.
Therefore, the file has been sent to the community.
A colleague writes to me that the cases ofObstbäumen and consequently thewolf are not part of the meeting.
In the codex, but the Walnuss is specifically mentioned as a protectress tree.
Can I leave my resignation on the message of the colleague or not?
On the one hand, I must let go of my dependence on an expert's opinion.
Nevertheless, the opinion is clear.
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an English translation for this sentence as it is in German. Please provide a translation in the appropriate language.
We understand that.

Translation: Eilmeldung: Schwerer Verkehrsunfall bei Selb
Recently, a slower traffic accident occurred on St. 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the press alarm of the Polizei currently (14:03 Uhr), a car is approaching to merge in the traffic.
There are wounded.
"Ah okay verstehe." translates to "Oh okay, you understand." in English.
Good, then thank you again that it all just worked out!
" Rat und Ideen zu keinem Berufsleben"
First of all, happy Weihnachten to all!
My Christmas is unfortunately very good because my favorite part just understands everything one can understand.
Before I leave here now... Briefly: I need advice and, preferably, from people who know something about my situation - also from you.
I'm just using the Ref as a prompt.
Initially, I had studied something else and was also working in a certain area (to at least maintain some level of anonymity, I'm not going to give more details here).
All of this was then quite boring, and I looked for alternatives that would make me more fun.
As soon as I became a student, I was confident that it was - although the conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that was irrelevant to me.
I'm now at the third "I Google other places" post.
And it's only one month back.
At those angles, I always decided to proceed and, at least, clear the reflection, after that, I still can hear.
But I'm completely done.
I had so little free time that I completely was overwhelmed.
Now, it's vacation time, but there is still a big amount of work waiting for me.
During the reference, I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my bedtime was my bedtime.
"Da hatte ich frei."  This sentence is in German and translates to "I had freedom."
And the stress on the work was in the moment equal.
Now, even the family gathering is causing me a lot of stress.
And then there are those obscure structures that even get me nerved.
Ultimately, it's fun and looking back at it, the feedback process seems to work well for this context.
But I'm completely exhausted and I question how much stress my body is承受 before it completely shuts down - if he's not already doing that.
Ich frage mich, ob ich das den Rest des Arbeitslebens so havene - gerade als ich hereche some quotes from you -, or ob ich nicht doch wieder in den 昔时的级别 holen sollte, da mir wertgeschätzen wird, meine自由時間 nehmen kann,wenn es erforderlich ist und die work appeared somehow langweilig, but it was paid appropriately and I had worked on it in a team, not as a single opponent like now, which is the most time of the case.
But then I question myself if I'll be notciable again in one year like now and feeling unfulfilled.
You might think that everything is somehow exciting, but maybe as an audience or ideas, how I obtained this situation, where I'm completely done and starting to think about the smallest things, comes into play.
Ich bin nowa y podklane, es führt wahrscheinlich zu nichts gutem.
也许您的建议可以帮助我，至少看到隧道的尽头一小部分灯光 - 我可以 enjoy Christmas Eve, which already fits for me.
Thank you for reading and I apologize to the润色r for my dog.
I hope, my situation is at least a little clear now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continuously evolved, which includes the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" control system, which has resulted in perfect modeling of the behavior of a reactor driver.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X speakers, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest stage of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and Amp measurements, the VTX drivers are waiting with an authentication, which is absolutely impressive.
Furthermore, these Amps include the more sophisticated Valvetronix resistor青配器。
This may be translated as: "This is partly based on real analog watches, because these can better capture the variations and nuances of a watch's dial as compared to any simulation."
In addition to this sophisticated tuning, the VTX speakers also include a closed system and a bass reflex system, allowing natural sounds to be extracted just as easily.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level and delete until the intensity and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of wheels- sound with modeling technology is primarily to thank the 2001 presented VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Certainly, they were constantly updated to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led again to a failure of the VOX Valvetronix series - this time with increased functionality and numerous, highly improved strength models.
From the traditional VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix-Serie has been designed in such a way that all Gitarristen will be绪 auf der Suche nach einer maximumen Sound-Vielfalt hierfür.
Alle Gitarristen türumen von der Druck und der Dynamik eines Röhrenverstärkers: Sie erwarten einen fetten Sound, eine nuancierte Wiedergabe von Game Dynamics und Saitenanschlag sowie eine prompte Ansprache.
During a comprehensive analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that mainly the end section determines the turbine character of a conductor, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The valve-Reactor-selection of any VT+ generator with a 12AX7 bell functions the behavior, effectively matching the subtle nuances and sound character of the bell generator to perfectly.
NBA: Despite having 20 points, Wagner loses to Clips.
The Orlando Magic's victory series in the NBA is on.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite scoring 20 points with seven assist from Franz Wagner and a game-high 106 points, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clips on Saturday.
The big head is also adaptable: with three customizable and flat-bottomed Klettverschluss-Teiler, it depends on your photo measurement needs and is suitable for all types of cameras - from full-frame system cameras to full-format wide-angle lens cameras.
Ultimately what goes into the backpack depends on both the size of the camera and the objective.
A possible completion would be a DSLR camera with an assigned objective, two to three alternate objectives, and a focusing flash.
larger DMSM cameras like the Sony A7 series or the Fuji X-T2 leave space for further objectives.
Furthermore, one can still collect quite a lot of ingredients.
And who has a small DDSL-camera (MFT-cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A, or E-Serie), can use the backpack for its accessories and for sensitive items.
Piloten der Drobot系統 treffen auch mit dem Everyday Backpack 20L eine optimale Wahl, denn der Rucksack bietet eine wunderschöne K率 von 20L fort und hat wunderschöne Platz für eine DJI Mavic Pro.
Vulkanausbruch auf La Palma: wohl längster der Geschichte
In the在短短的三周内 since the beginning of the outbreak, the lava streams on the Kanareninsel have caused great damage.
Is an end in view?
With a duration of已有85天， the vulnerability scan on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the outbreak of the Vulkan Tehuya in the year 1585 with 84 days is considered the fastest on the African Great Lakes region's waterway system before the Western Cape.
There are no relevant previous experiments available.
Although the activeness of the still unknown Vulkan in the Vieja cloud has reduced in the past days, Vulkan experts have still refused to provide any progress on when it could potentially end.
The indicators point to a continued process.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Kingdom, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-owned TV station RTVE.
"Schäden in Millionenhöhe" means "action in a million degrees" in German.
In just three weeks since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000-degree hot Lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
A quarter of a million km2 were covered by a meters-deep lava tube.
This sentence translates to "This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields."
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuate, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 millions of euros.
There were two new Landings caused by the heated Lava, each with a size of about 50 square kilometers.
Mostly, the significant and crucial banana production was affected particularly by the high-quality banan production, which includes about 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly, and which was already affected during the epidemic.
225 Hektar Bananenplantagen werden zerstört, weitere Flächen stark beeinträchtigt, schrieb die Zeitung "El País".
"Weihnachts und die Geschenke" ist eine von ihm wichtige Sache.  It is one of his important jobs.

The many bright colors under the Christmas tree are connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the bitter tension, something creative is involved.
Winterbreak belongs to the few traditional events that keep our increasingly split society together.
It is even more important to be aware of the festive tradition of skepticism, since the gesture of skepticism, which was considered aFriendly Agreement among natural beings by the French sociologe and ethnologe Marcel Mauss, could be removed from the status of a "Community Agreement among Nature's Hosts" and once again filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How did the Christkind come from Nikolaus?
Taking into account that the Reformation was led by the Protestants, who integrated the Christmas season strongly with the gift-giving.
Before, clothes were distributed on some kind of way on Christmas Eve.
The background of this still popular custom today is that the legendary king, Myra's bishop, secretly offered three women gold in their windows during a night to spare them a full life in sin.
From this non-ventional art of sharing, the beloved practice in Germany involved filling toys especially for children with coins.
Protestants stießen sich an diesem Brauch, because they reject the notion of "Heiligenverehrung" between God and the people.
From these reasons, they reject the institution.
Martin Luther made Jesus Christ child and founded new tradition line.
The focus of the gift moves Away from the holiday season.
Since most Protestants no longer focus so closely on these detailed matters, only the most vulnerable are affected, as the services of the Holy Spirit, such as the Martini glass and Martini cocktail, remain the principal part of the Christmas Eve celebration like the Martini introduction withMartini glass and Martini.
Today, you can find everything that your heart desires in packets before the table and under the Christmas tree, from desired luxury items to delicious treats.
Vielfalt and Traditions in Christian Land
Sources indicate a tradition of reading the Bible on the day of the Lord's Supper since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of the soul's separation became Christmas Day.
In allen christlich geprägten Ländern herrscht jedoch ein fröhliches Kuddelmuddel über die Frage vor, wer denn nun die Geschenke bringt den Kindern.
In Deutschland, the matter depends on the particular region whether it is the Christ child appearing on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Evesman, who essentially is a kind of Nikolaus, who was given some properties during the time.
There are, for example, his white仲夏夜之梦 (Arsèneèneèneèneèneèneèneèneène) which only has a little to do with the much more powerful Assyrebart of historical fiction, his Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl Schl

I hope I did everything right here, it's really my first post on Reddit after one year.
Regarding my issue: I started taking the vaccine again about five years ago because I had so much painful menstrual cramps and PMS during my period.
Now I would like to leave it again because I already need enough medication that I cannot do without.
My main problem, to some extent, not the pain, but my body.

This is a sentence in a language that has no word for " Kommode" or "Karton", so it will have to be translated manually.
The computer monitor is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
That means that the coffee machine cannot be removed because no one can stay alone in my apartment.
Thank you for the news.
But why only 20 EUR?
The origin value of this bench was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it's not in all textbooks, therefore, the query to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be about a fundamental problem.
The English translation for "Ref: Unterricht planen (EK)" is "Request for Feedback."
Hello, dear colleagues.
I have been studying since summer, studying makes me fun, but I still have big problems planning my study in economics in the afternoon.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not very well equipped, so I can only use the table, the curriculum book, and an OHP as a medium.
I also cannot copy s/w in the school (which is quite uncomfortable).
I currently need quite a long time to plan my days.
We are currently working on the topic of Geofaktoren and there is really no one else for every hour.
In short, the methods remain the same, but另一方面， I don't want to spend overly much time on simple teaching tasks (which I also need for UBs).
Ich bin daran interessiert, das Lernziel zu erreichen, und我会首先考虑达到目标的方法，然后思考我是如何做到这一点的(通常在我学校的教材之外，我产生一个工作笔记，其中包含来自我没有在学校学习的书籍的文本)。
We have the book "Terra" and among the most important goals in the book, I am more dissatisfaction.
Therefore, also the work notebook.
Perhaps a doctor who specializes in time-efficiently studying with the book could be helpful to me.
I would really enjoy it.
I would like to receive the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
Ich hadde我真的已经为一个新的在#PRS_ORG#上entschieden，不过我会非常乐意首先尽快安装这些路由。
The trade fears about the 2G regulation of the Christmas market.
In most operations, only the person who has beenimperialist or geneseed can be involved.
The trade places it as unnecessary and complaints about unit trade discounts.
He has also solved a possible solution.
The 2G regulations are detrimental to the important Christmas market from the perspective of the Germany Trade Association (HDE).
Among those with non-essential requirements, payment invoices should be highlighted, according to HDE's Head of Accounts, Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE (Human Development and Education) among 1100 vendors, more than 70 percent of them viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many would have already taken the Christmas church down.
"What should really be the positive point of the year now is often a pool without a platform," said Genth.
According to the source, companies with 2G connectivity restrictions lost approximately one third of their pre-crisis output in the previous week.
It's running smoothly only in the individual food market and online.
The conference requested consequences from the significant development.
The主营业经理 said that the sale with mask, distance and hygiene policy was a safe activity.
"2G beim Einkaufen bringt uns im Kampf against the pandemic not further."
The current regulations7 caused customer confusion and required high personal involvement.
He requested that the Banisterial regulation should be洞开 throughout the country.
Afterward, every customer would only be controlled once on 2G (improving or upgrade) and would have access to all products on that day through the obtained key card.
Furthermore, in the individual market - as already in the public transport system with the 3G Regulation ( Impf, Genese or Getestet) - storage probe control is necessary.
The spezialised apartment supermarkets, German Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas market.
The frequencies were previously at approximately 75 per cent of the pre-Corona- epidemic level, and the ratios were about 90 per cent.
"These numbers will certainly decline further in the so-called Christmas market, according to Vorstandschef Wilhelm Wellner of the " Wirtschaftswoche"."
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs for the center, it was attempted to find solutions and receive compensation.
Furthermore, it includes the so-called "bändchenlösung" where " visitors, for example, can once出示 their 2G connection and then, like in a club hotel, – equipped with a armband similar to a club club – can access all sales without being interrupted". dpa
I recently received the #PRS_ORG# and was delivered.
The Spiegel has a leak, and also there is another error that was trying to be cleaned up with a clear liquid substance.
"That looks nice."
I would be grateful if you could take the mirror back and I have already将该镜子放入包裹并包装起来。
How must I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with higher performance and higher color output.
For the adjustment of the color temperature and color scale of the lamp, a modern monitor with unusual possibilities is needed.
In addition to the adjustment of illumination, there are two standard temperature values: Daylight and Artificial Intelligence.
It's also possible to adjust the color temperature range of 3100-5650 K manually and specialize it.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simply and intuitive to use.
The green creates a very bright and high-quality lightstorm, completely without flash.
The防晒指数 of 120 degrees, with which you can enhance the visibility of small breasts at relatively small distances, is outstanding.
Additionally, this is also true in small spaces or short periods of time in media situations.
You can adjust the alignment几乎 without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on the film set and in the studio.
The optional acquisition of DMX512-Controller enables the remote control of cameras in video studios or when the camera is mounted on weak access points.
On the right side of the blind, there is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a gleaming display.
The display shows the current Celsius degree setting in percent and the current temperature in Celsius.
Additionally, there is the slot for the NP-F Akkus (not included in the giveaway package).
The consumer bundle has up to three panel settings for horizon and color temperature.
To convert the individual preferences on the storage洞穴， simply by longer clicking on one of the storage buttons and it's done.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the familiar state returns when new switching is done - very useful in the studio if, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperature.
working with a battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of the company with high NP-F power capacity.
These are often owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can easily return to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be tested before the set to determine if the adsc have sufficient performance - it's a battery tester with built-in battery cell - for each of the two battery cells, a value is displayed in the two display monitors (the left adc top monitor, the right on the bottom monitor).
Additionally, it's自然而然 possible for the passive recipient of the transmitted network segment to continue to be supplied with energy.
The construction of the invisible mirror is very simple.
They have used a 16mm lens as an approach, thereby allowing you to directly approach your camera.
The agreement between the two sides can be made by setting up markers on both sides.
It was addressed that also the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and therefore are specifically designed for high effort and harsh applications.
Moreover, a jumpgelenk is included in the delivery beginning.
The English translation for this sentence is: "Moreover, it is included in the delivery package."
So you can easily buy the new vegetables with all the necessary products without any problems to transport or store.
Sorry, I took the gift and it's too small :(
"We wanted a party: Frankfurt wins after impressive comeback against Leverkusen"
What kind of惊人的反应 from Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two-time habitually promoted Germans were perceived as on the way to the next League game.
But then the SGE came back on，消除 within a good minute's time the frustration of a through-the-wall season start of the soul and scored with 5:2. "It's terrible what the kids have done today", trainer Oliver Glasner said at DAZN, and speaking about a "Pauschal-Lob, to everyone who was there."
However, at first, it looked like the new addition to the list of players standing behind their expectations on the number 10 Frankfurters was coming.
Patrik Schick had brought the Leverkusener into play with a 2:0 lead.
Then what happened, impressed the SGE trainer as well.
"How the players have then come back and shown a great performance," said Glasser.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Also, auch Abwehrspieler Christopher Lenz, der erstmals sincerhin und因其overwogenen Muskelverletzung auf dem Platz stand, betonte die moral der Teamkollegen.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly vast," the 27-year-old said and thanked the audience with a look specifically on the result.
That was the party we wanted to have today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner will now keep the focus on herself, but she also thinks highly of herself in terms of her personal situation.
It is unusual that we had all players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top-classification.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players are very professional.
Now, we want to continue“step by step”and remain“bescheiden”and cover the tasks until the upcoming year“on this level”.
Next, there is already an outdoor game on the program for the English week at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30 Uhr, Sky).
"I'm receiving the email that my package is coming to you because of a mistake on my end."
I have attempted to register at #PRS_ORG# and there is no chance left.
Can it be sent directly to me or do I need to wait until I have received the money and cancel the request again?
Would for me then effectively mean that I cannot yet bring it up because it has already been a very long time since I last mentioned it.
Are they already eating at the #PRS_ORG# table?
Help : Please provide the English translation for the sentence : Dämpfer für Handball-Frauen vor Viertelfinale gegen Spanien
Germany's volleyball women return after the defense against Denmark with frozen hands and boring eyes on the notebook.
At the end of the World Cup quarter-final, the DHB team scored a herbe Niederlage against 800 spectators in Granollers with a score of 16:32 (8:13) and must now play against Gastgeber Spanien in the final.
"We were much more anxious and had too much respect for the competitor."
Against Spain, we must act differently.
After the first defeat in the round, Germany closed the Hauptrundengruppe III with 8:2 points behind Denmark (10:0).
It's painful that we couldn't take the flow.
"That was one bad game that we must solve", said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for the quarter-finals, there must be a significant improvement against the WM-Zweiten of 2019 on the upcoming Saturday, in order to keep the dream of the first medical degree since 2007 in life.
The best German Werferin in the match against the previous season's Olympiasieger Team Denmark was Rückraumspielerin Alina Grijseels with six teams.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack, nor in defense.", said forward Xenia Smits, adding, "We must now quickly look to the front."
From above to below not on the height.
Unlike the previous five matches, the German team was not on the height.
Mistakes and technical errors in the operation and inaccuracies in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 lead after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job market and avoided some dark prospects.
The first goal arrived for the DHB-Team after 9:30 minutes, as Grijseels successfully防下了一场精彩的反击。
The expected initial reaction was not this.
Despite the aggressive stance of the Danish women, the Danish women were unable to get into a game - and if they did, they suffered at the hands of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the stands of the Scandinavian women.
So, die Partie begann im early morning with the score at 3-10 after 20 minutes, although Rückraumspielerin Mia Zschocke Few hours later, because of one harsh Fouls to her Gegenspielerin still looked red.
In the quarterfinale, they can still participate.
Only in the end phase of the first half, the DHB selection improved slightly and until the break, it was even up to 5 players.
The previously only faint hope of an automatic activation after the loop was already at 7 minutes past 9:19.
The Groener-Schützlinge Again silenced all areas and made it clear to the well-planned opponent who qualified for the medical trials side during the end round, consequently.
In the aftermath, the German team couldn't seem to catch up to a level of performance improvement and was clearly the clear winner on the field.
The English translation for "DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Familientraditionen in der Weihnachtszeit" is "The Bach-Advent Calendar, Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season."

Could you please send me some sort of transaction number or anything that might help?
The English translation for " Überweisungsbestätigung... etc" is "Release proof...etc."
I would like to receive a good code.
类似于#PRS_ORG#礼品卡
Does that work for you?
The title is there, I am a trained Impfsmith in mobile Impfteams, where (until now) only the BioNTech/Pfizer-Impfstoff is used to impregnate children and adults in training hospitals.
Since these are almost fully done, part of it is being used in Impfzentren for me.
I would be happy to answer questions without time limits on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, if these are not focused on a person-level (e.g. "I take medication X, it agrees with the Impfung..").
In my task area, the information for the vaccination, the indication (person has an appointment for a vaccination after the COVID-19 vaccination protocol and no reasons to others), the medical documentation, and, if applicable, emergency assistance during allergic reactions (it has never happened to me).
The treatment itself is available through qualified personnel, such as medical方的专业人才。
However, we often have, rather than "only," (to God's mercy) medical-technical assistants for the medication preparation who cannot perform Impfations themselves, so I can perform the majority of Impfations there myself.
Deep "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, contributed by an Amberger, it has been addressed in the BR News program "Wir in Bayern" for heavy reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term "Host mi?" this time was not compiled by the contributors.
No, it was not a "person who is anxious".
And no one "must" make everything quickly.
That what they heard from the TV host was completely wrong.
The English translation for this sentence is: "The man from Amberg expressed the solution and probably did it also help many supervisory farmers to produce Erstauen."
The speakers, according to the listeners, the "hidlerer" is a step where someone passes the door.
Dialektforscher Antony Rowley, who has been asked by the Bayerische Fernsehen as an expert for years, supported this.
With the annotation that this is a typical upper阶层 term, something like the more familiar word "Houdern", it is essentially贡ebled.
What a education hub was established - even for those who have lived in Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy any more books since two weeks.
It comes with the following error message: Oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have downloaded the #PRS_ORG#, started it again, connected to the PC, synchronization enabled and repaired.
Nothing was helpful.
"Reifenwahl beim Rennrad- wirklich so pannensicher?"
Today, I'm very excited to be back because I wanted to at least train for my bike tour in the upcoming week.
said, starting, and I went with my bicycle I bought online yesterday.
The first 40 km were also really beautiful - but then that happened which is typical of every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!)
Glasssplitter on the line.
Zack, thick-cut welterse Zischen und mein Hinterreifen wollte den rest der Strecke auf gar keinen Fall mehr mitmachen.
Since I had no real possibility to search for my replacement pockets and replacement belt, I had to circle back and take the heavier train home with a slightly lower pace.
Was then also technically not quite so good, perhaps it is better if I do it again before the bike tour.
Now I am but a moment behind you, and I hope that you can help me.
Since I had a relatively long route over several days, I would be very interested in having this problem频繁地 afterwards.
Now it wasn't exactly bad, because the old wheels from the owner (a kind-hearted older man who had taken me to buy the bike at 14 pm and had taken 120 km away!) and the one he had already described as suboptimal because he had been riding them for me here for a year.
If I but am thinking that I must take a turn after 80-90 kilometers, then I am really bad-hearted :D
Now I've come into a conversation with a older man on the train, and he was curiously asking me, "Why don't you have the Marathon Plus seats? They should be available."
Now it sounds very catchy.
But are these really so uncomfortable?
I have little enthusiasm now to donate 40€/reifs, just so we can get back on track.
Further on, I am asking myself: at the moment, I believe I am on a bike with a wheel size of 25 x 622.
Although there are also (it looks like) marathon Plus shoes, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you rate me overall compared to other drivers on the course?
The Schwalbe-Seite seems to me! Lauewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the support and kind regards!
The car is driving against a tree: the driver has been killed.
The 53-year-old man was driving his car with unknown cause from Rheinberg to Xanten on the B57 between those two cities and ended up on the opposite side of the highway, as the Polizei told us.
There came a situation involving a crowded front seat with a vehicle containing a 27-year-old man.
Then the car of the 53-year-old was pushed against a tree and the person inside the car was trapped.
The English translation for this sentence is: The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old co-worker were seriously injured during the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Breitbänder B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our solo series received another round of returns.
OLO 15 means the new Solo 15 and visually reminds of the big images with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this proposal, a suitable designed foot is directly integrated to support the lower part of the structure on the correct height position.
This sentence in English translates to: "This does not have an impact on audio, and therefore can be adjusted based on specific circumstances at home."
In principle, theOLO 15 is very suitable for individuals who play a less prominent role in terms of maximum speed, but it aims to achieve an extremely high level.
A 10 cm lens is simply not capable of producing quite such small blood pressure monitor readings, almost completely unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that theOLO 15 sounds harsh.
In相反，它们已经相当年轻，并且对于它们的体型非常着迷且具体。
The English translation for this sentence is: "TheOLO 15 was awarded with a significant high-ton格."
This is commonly done in cold-chain vehicles to optimize the increased frequency of circulation.
"Exkurs auf den Hörplatz: Die SOLO 15 bedient sich mit sehr klarem und feierndem Klang."
If the sound source is远离源头， the high-tone range can be reduced, and so the sound level can be adjusted to be lower.
Thanks to the pointillistic source, the positioning of the individual components of a musical score on the optimal stereo grid is precise and highly immersive.
The referents with extremely low mechanical losses of B100-6 OHM contribute to a false dynamic that seeks its own.
TheOLO 15 not only adds to our solo series, but also strengthens these aspects in terms of potential and assessment.
How does it recommend making thoughts about the final optimization of the leadverter at the beginning of any construction project, in order to plan corresponding changes during the construction process?
If you want to furnify the tables, the height reduction of the梁 must be adjusted accordingly, as the梁 is adding yet another material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the factory), you should first embed an 8-mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate location, so that you can easily pass the cable there later on.
With the help of an antenna, now comes the launch of the low-frequency oscillator in the front, so that the B100 - 6 OHM can be launched later.
This sentence in English is: "Rückseitig sollte dieseÖffnung mit einer 45° Fase versehen werden, um dieÖffnungsfläche des Lautsprecherchassis im Inneren so groß wie möglich zu gestalten."
The four reconstruction points of B 100 - 6 OHM will receive a differentiation in the phase, as demonstrated in the figure "Detail Phase".
Then, you begin with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side mirrors on a flat surface in front of you.
On these, the backline, the Deckel, the front, and the ground are now raised.
However, also the three verifications should be done and加密ed.
The corrections themselves may vary in the material quality depending on whether one wants to corrections, for example, from fresh materials from the factory instead of making them herself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second page will be added.
Then follow all the cloves of the finger, also the two sides, sowie the front.
With a suitable anchor or for anchor, the opening of the shallow draft, as well as the intersectionklemme on the return path, are facilitated.
After that, one uses a randfraser to address different lines of the actual box.
Also, the upper surface of the cushion can damit be bent.
After that, the cushion is attached securely to the floor with its feet and additional long metal chains are attached.
It leads to the annotation and heating (2.5-mm蒜器) of the Legendre column and the access plate.
After the roof was insulated (insinsify / scrape) with ice, one begins with the assessment of the balcony.
The best way is through the 35mm bass reflex opening in the background.
However, one can take the entire and unprocessed cable piece by piece through the 8mm Bohring until the termination opening and let it stand there about 30 cm长.
In the upper part of the house, you can lead the电话线 to the switchboard and also let it run smoothly there.
Next, the Frequenzweiche are prepared and used.
The building plan of the flexible spaces, as well as the corresponding addition plan can be appended to this document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the fluency wires are installed and the access terminal is transferred, the initialization of the 8mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is still not completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bastREFLEX opening and with some force, you can let the hot metal stick to the opening and thus release it.
Through the activation of B100-6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can monitor the depth accurately.
Now comes the evaluation according to the description.
After that, the B 100 - 6 OHM isgonnen und mit den entsprechenden Schrauben festgeschraubt.
The orientation plays a crucial role here, so the plus lead ( marked cable) must be connected to the plus side ( greater contact) of the driver.
At the end, the Bass reflex register is shortened to the given length of 28 mm (total length of the register).
For the purpose of treatment, a cushion of de淳ing material is divided into two parts and locked in the warehouse.
The opening of the低音中心 channel should be stopped.
Can I receive a order now and have it delivered by June first?
Hello to all.
Finally, we can confirm that we will also organize the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us from known reasons to bring more than four people to the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short delay in the implementation.
"aber"：行为大约会有三个人使用跟踪器，这样我们就能预测2021年的奥斯卡电影，并希望还能够影响到数以万计的您！
"We do our best to avoid delays or other problems."
But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we'll do everything possible to keep the Oscar ceremony as harmonious as possible.
It will be around 030 UTC.
"Bringt euchuch mal getränke kalt, plante gute Erden und Macht euch bereit für eine lange, though very interesting night ahead!"
