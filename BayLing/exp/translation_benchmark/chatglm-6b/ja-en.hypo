The keyword for this sentence is "building condition survey system".  The article "落とし穴": What is a hole in the "building condition survey system"? (ダイヤモンド・オンライン) - Yahoo!ニュース
●为了促进中古住宅市场的活性，a newly established "Building Condition Survey" system has led to a good demand for middle-aged and older housing loans.
The prices of apartments, houses, and houses of origin are rising, and the market for services such as maintenance is growing.
On the other hand, while the dream of owning a home is rising during the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of items represented by the acronym "駅前・駅近・駅直結 " "large" "TNT" has increased, and the reduction in the number of newly constructed homes is also having an impact.
However, compared to abroad, the流通水平 of existing(mid-sized) residential communities in Japan is still at a relatively low level.
So, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MLIT) revised a portion of the Building Estate Transaction Law, and began an Estate Condition Survey aimed at conducting transactions for comfortable and safe ancient residential buildings, known as an "Instagram Survey" (see <https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf>).
This is a system where a architect who is skilled in residential construction checks for existing conditions and contents of a building, and presents the report to the buyer along with a notice.
The Ministry of Interpersonal Relations claims that introduction of transactions will bring benefits to both the buyer and seller.
The seller can conduct a property inspection before the sale and purchase negotiation to avoid the subsequent fees, giving customers peace of mind.
There is a saying that the differentiation of competition objects also matters.
On the other hand, for the seller's side, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the middle-aged and older houses they are planning to buy and obtain the necessary information for purchase, which suggests that it is a system with significant benefits for the seller.
However, within the existing system, the guiding power for building condition surveys lies primarily with the seller side.
Furthermore, it is important to be mindful of the point where only the notification system, i.e., information overflow, is considered as a duty.
Therefore, the property broker who represents the referral has a duty to introduce a builder who can conduct a property condition survey during the referral, or not, and mention that the implementation of it has not been authorized. This means that there is a duty for the broker to do so, but the actual implementation has not been authorized.
● Risks associated with operator-led offerings: On the other hand, if one looks beyond domestic markets, it is found that in well-functioning markets such as America and Britain, similar systems are already in place.
In the early stages of residential sales, there is a system in which the buyer asks a "builder" or "builder's agent" called "インスペクター" or "ビルディング・サーベイヤー" to conduct a building inspection.
For example, in the United States, states as well, 70 to 90% of vintage housing transactions are currently in process.
From the point of view of having a "purchaser" as the main driver of an transaction, the Japanese-style transaction and its characteristics are significantly different from those of a "seller"-centered transaction.
The seller's side demands to show the interior of the building at least once, to make it as high as possible and sell as soon as possible.
Therefore, the customer side is considering铭刻ing the survey content and implementing appropriate repairs to ensure a comfortable and stable living environment.
Even with the same transaction, there is still a disconnect between the two parties' goals and thoughts.
Therefore, regarding Japan's system, there are several concerns that have been mentioned as potential risks.
● The调查的范围 of the country's export-oriented market strategy is limited to the minimum.
Due to the fact that this is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of missing out on truly important issues.   For the company involved in the transaction, the introduction of a broker (client) who紹介s the assigned case can be like a guest.
However, there is a possibility that "clueless" transactions such as not reporting不利调查 results to the merchant may occur.

The saying goes that there are different opinions on the star system evaluation system from ancient times.

"The price of effort is a song of humanism"
In recent adolescent漫画， "The Spirited Away of the Dragon's Bite" is an unusual one because "修行 is more numerous".
There is a saying that the training sections that do not include fight scenes, even when they are bright and dark, do not have users' popularity.
That was also true of the same serial novel 'ONE PIECE', where it took two years of practice to learn to only touch the water without floating, but it is important to know that even though the remaining part of the water was left unchanged, the author made a point to emphasize that it was still quick and ruthless.
Although staying in the same place for practice can be beneficial, there may be cases where it does not have the same correlation.
So the protagonist of "The Ghostly Sword,"炭治郎's修行， ended with him bowing to Ikoria Ishiguro, who helped him live, and then offering himself for sacrifice, as Ishiguro told him, "You cannot hold the power of life and death over others!" It started from there.

The sentence in Chinese is: "が、まだ修行もしてないド素人の炭治郎を狭霧山に連れて行き、夜明けまでに山の麓まで降りてこいと言い放つ鱗滝。"  The English translation for this sentence would be: "He brings a non-human, un修行ed man, who doesn't even practice, to the narrow mountain and says, 'I will come down to the foot of the mountain by night.'"
The mountain has holes and石头投石機s and traps, and it seems that it may fall apart before it can become a place of spiritual practice.
Although it is difficult to trace the origin of this phrase, it can be translated as: "Despite all this, they still enjoy嗅ing the sweet scent of someone who has been given a shot of alcohol by someone else and trying to avoid it."
But still, "It doesn't mean that if he suddenly can't avoid it, his physical abilities will suddenly become very high!", which he quotes to炭治郎， is the essence of the game of desolving the ghosts and not being killed by them.
Humans do not suddenly become strong without any underlying reason, and the awakening process is only able to utilize the " strength and skills" that have been cultivated up to that point in a natural and dramatic way.
The English translation for the sentence is: "For those who have worked hard, they only get paid for the effort, and no effort is worth anything in return. The concept of '等价交换' of effort is a human song that differs from those who possess abnormal powers and is difficult to follow for this game."
This, old?

The purpose of this chapter is to convey the message that this is not just a match between two monsters, but a representation of the larger society and the struggles that people face in their daily lives.
From the beginning of the calligraphy competition, even though we have changed our match to other challenges such as special scenic landscapes and various styles, it still is not a match but rather an experience that is not only challenging but also not regrettable.
In this context, the feeling of a world tournament starting with gradually increasing tension reflects the certainty of the increase in readers' interest and the fact that the performance during this period was actually calculated. It feels like a heartwarming moment.
And, in the crucial game before the final match, there is one mountain that cannot be avoided: the third place match of the professional league player.
Although the tournament card is magnificent, it is still hard to beat the excitement of watching a拉面man approach the stage while holding a chicken and beef sign, saying, "This is my show from now on!!"
The English translation for "とチョップを叩きつけようとする" is "to knock down the opponent and fight."
However, a pedestrian who was accidentally struck by that sword stopped him and prevented him from moving, saying in a silent manner, "This is just the way it is, and we will separate just like that."
What is this? Both teams have already lost, and there is no chance left for us to play against King of the Hill in this game.
However, there is a phrase "that's why you should never cross the street after dark" that is often used to express the idea that something is not worth the risk of getting involved in.
If this were to be shown, it would be impossible not to imagine the活躍 of a distant future!
The phrase "キャラが立つというのはこういうことなんだと、僕も漫画家として今なお痛感させさせられる一幕です!" translates to "The thing that a character stands for is this, and just today, I was subjected to this painful experience as a漫画家！"
Such a conflict between them will not end with just a few inches, but the famous scene is the tears of the拉面man after the match.
The translation for this sentence is: "You don't need to be strong as God's运 to do great things!!"
This is the English translation for the sentence: というセリフです。
This is a heavyannotated annotation for the original text, which suggests that readers and knights have until now never won against each other, and instead, have been defeated without actually having any power. It seems that the author feels a sense of "unfairness" towards these characters.
But by forcing this statement on the beauty queen, Yudetamago先生 has刺了她自己一手的贈品。
This sentence in Japanese is: "This line says, 'Then what makes a lion a real fighter, capable of defeating a man-eating lion?'"  The English translation of this sentence would be: "With this line, readers are wondering, 'Then what makes a lion a real fighter, capable of defeating a man-eating lion?'"
"How do you do it?"
It seems that this sentence is trying to convey a sense of surprise or confusion about a previous scene that cannot be seen, and from a writer's perspective, it is clear that this is a statement about the similarity in this situation to a lesson that the author, Yudetamago, has given to himself about cutting corners.
This is really something!
I believe that this is the largest point in this volume without a doubt.
