The student participants took the lead at the Zhejiang University academic conference, bringing interesting research findings to light. (Source：新华网)
Here's the English translation for the given sentence:  "We used air to wash our hands, took a breath to diagnose illness, and accurately searched for the source of smog."   Note: This is a fictional translation and may not accurately reflect the actual English translation of the original text.
The main研究者 of these achievements are students, and their research covers various major fields such as environmental, machinery, energy, healthcare, life science, and cultural education. Students start from a curious idea and have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biofeedback: Your Home Health Care Doctor
The team of Zhang Diming from the Medical Biotechnology Engineering Department demonstrated a biological sensor on a mobile phone endpoint, which is only half the size of a mobile phone.
"你只需要轻轻呼出一口气，这套仪器就能从你呼出的气体成分中，初步检测你的身体健康状况。"  The English translation for this sentence is: "Just take a deep breath and this set of instruments can conduct an initial assessment of your physical health status from the气体 composition of your exhalation."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to smartphones, and after breathing out, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart watches that are available in the market can detect health conditions typically measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This sentence can be translated into English as follows: "And this set of biosensing devices utilizes a novel material called carbon nanotubes, which targets chemical elements. Its keen "嗅觉" allows it to deeper and more accurately reflect physical health conditions."
Intelligent手术 lights：医生的 high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart medical lights have also been used in surgical theaters.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss日内瓦 International Innovation Fair this year.
The graduate student from the Institute of Photovoltaic Science and Engineering, Zhu Linqing and Shuang Junfeng, has opened a new perspective by discovering the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED surgical transparent lights.
" Many diseases are not detected or treated early, which is related to the lights used in doctors' operating rooms. "
Shen Junfu said that when a doctor performs early cancer screening, if she is unable to see all tumor tissues in a timely manner，癌细胞 may continue to spread after that.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lampholders that can enhance the contrast between different tissues under UV light by adjusting the color spectrum.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, color contrast, and visibility of the beam according to the needs of the operation and their personal habits at any time.
This intelligent手术 light has been trialled at hospitals affiliated with Zhejiang University Medical School, including Zhejiang University Children's Hospital.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the national ACM-ICPC competition.
Translate this sentence into English: Use air to wash your hands: save water and look cool.
The English translation for this sentence is: "普通人洗手就是用水冲，顶多擦点肥皂，挤点洗手液，而李启章等同学则发明了一套‘空气洗手装置’。"
As long as we sit on the device's水龙头， our weight can compress the air out.
"就像一个打气筒。"的英文翻译是 "like a pump."
压缩d air results in a fluid formation at the water tap, merging with the water.
So, we can get our hands clean!
The color reaction and bacteria residual test prove that the effectiveness of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary washing methods.
This device can only be driven by our own gravity, ensuring洗净程度 and saving 90% of water resources. The entire process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second global major challenge summit, this invention stood out among many world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
"Please arrange for a back-up to be sent to me as soon as possible, thank you."

"暂时没有，谢谢" 的英语翻译是 "暂时还没有，谢谢"。
The English translation of this sentence is: "He called me to tell you about his location #PRS_ORG#."
"I can't wait any longer,Cancel my order."
I bought it from #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the address wrong.
Can you modify it?
"或取消订单" 的英语翻译是 "or cancel order"。
"好的，麻烦了"的英文翻译是 "Alright, thank you very much."
The certificate that comes to mind as being very meaningful is the emergency medical certification.
This is one of the important skills certificates that I feel is more important than a driver's license!
的普及一下：急救措施实际上是在发生突发事件时紧急救援的应对策略，即在救护车到达之前进行抢救。
It is well-known that there is a certain period of time when the救护车 comes after the事故 has occurred, and that this is the most critical period.
This is the moment when you need emergency medical attention.
If I really have a heart attack, brain stroke, and respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes of life, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so crucial to have close friends and family members who are familiar with first aid!
When someone passes away at our hands, we can use our professional knowledge to save them, rather than simply standing there with no action to take. The feeling of helplessness is too可怕 to describe.
"In China, according to our official data, there are over three million accidental deaths each year, the most dangerous being sudden heart failure."
The average of 15% of the US population can survive.
"In Las Vegas casino hotel, about 80% can come out fine, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is said by Lu Li, the founder of First反应.
If someone has a heart attack, they can no longer breathe and their heart can no longer beat, and holding them down with a hand on their人中 will do nothing.
There is only a possibility of saving someone's life through artificial respiration and chest compressions if they are in a critical condition.
I found that very few people have this awareness of learning emergency medical treatment now, but when things happen, it's too late. So, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can make timely responses in在面对紧急状况时。
"You might still be able to save a life!"
"急救证 can be applied for emergency medical training center in your local Red Cross training center. I applied for emergency medical training center in Zhuhai, and students have discounts."
"PS: The last picture is a record of the goals that I have to achieve before the age of 25. Adding a lifeguard certification to my goal list was also a few months ago, but it's确实是 completed!"
Next, I plan to take other certificates I want to study for. I'm thinking of taking a diving certification. I saw a diving emergency certification on Xiaohongshu, and it seems like you need an emergency certification to take it. So, actually, an emergency certification is still very useful!
我订单了 ##NUMBER#。
"There's only one虾饺 at 13 yuan!"
I have not tried it yet.
"How can #NAME# be unclear?"
Is one price 13 dollars?
"昨天 #PRS_ORG# 漏送餐品，这次就一个虾饺给我吃！" 的英语翻译是：  "I missed the delivery from #PRS_ORG# yesterday, so please give me one虾饺 to eat this time!"
"Because I saw that the code I entered earlier was有效."
"Let's start with the conclusion. In my opinion, 'The Great Buddha' is a total piece of shit, from all perspectives."
But if you要说 this movie is not even a highlight, then it's not entirely true - at least the soundtrack selection is quite good.
Here's the English translation for the sentence: "烂片有很多种类，能让观众在电影院里安然入睡的算一种，能让观众看完后充满愤怒也算一种。《四海》对观众来说就像是峨眉山上的猴子，它能用无数种方式来点燃你的怒火。"  Translation: "Bad movies come in many forms, one of which is to make you fall asleep while watching in the cinema, and another is to leave you feeling angry after watching. The four seas for viewers are like monkeys on the峨眉山， able to ignite your anger in countless ways."
"In terms of侮辱观众，韩寒 is truly talents beyond measure."
The most painful thing about this film is that it feels like a creation from a K-drama, difficult to describe, with gaps that are as apparent as a windbreaker worn by M哥.
Even after watching it, you might be怀疑 whether there's a导演 hidden隐喻 in there, but when you carefully think about it, you realize that it's actually just a load of shit.
Let me give you a brief overview of some情节 that I find difficult to understand.
The男主角's residence should be on a small island located in a Southern direction, with his grandmother as his sole support.
Her grandmother has an愿望 to see snow, and the plot arranges for a neighbor's grandfather to drive a small mini-van to take her to the northern part of the city to see snow.
The translation of this phrase in English is: "An elderly man is sitting in a cozy面包车 from the south to the north to see snow?"
He and his father are still very confident about it.
Then this old man left without saying anything.
How did the女主's brother obtain a business license to open a hotel on a disabled ship?
The sentence in English translation is: "Why can't the岛上飞车党's little street gang make a narrow mountain road stand still easily?"
Then the truck delivering concrete stopped at the side of the road, and no driver could be found anywhere around.
This equipment feel is too obvious.
Why would a small-time hustler 飞车党 with criminal suspect status become a part-time police officer when their record is not good?
When faced with high-interest loans, why don't they报警？ In the movie, the police even asked if there was any difficulty?
A adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in the hotel. They then force-fit someone who is unable to find the hotel owner and decide to stay in the room for a night outside.
This absurd storyline persists throughout the entire film, causing me to feel distress when I recall it because the plot is so unrealistic.
"Apart from the plot, what is even worse is the film's theme, or rather, there is no theme at all. It is just a divisive and unpleasant reunion."
At the beginning of the movie, you would think he meant to film a comedy, after 20多 minutes, you猜 it might be a motivational film, when you are halfway through the movie, you think it might be a drama about the difficulties of young people in a small town, and after finishing the movie, you don't even know what you just watched, followed by a deep怀疑 of yourself, why would you go to the cinema to enjoy someone else's diarrhea?
For the majority, it is also familiar with the approaches and patterns of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about motorcycle drivers, you can make it a励志-喜剧 film that tells audiences how a talented beginner can gradually progress to success through perseverance.
If you want to make a romantic film, you should just tell the story of a typical小镇青年 who loves riding a bike and a server girl from the local restaurant with a clear and straightforward narrative.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your narrative should not contain things that are inconsistent with the normal world.
Why couldn't they just have some wild imaginations, like the character that Yin played who got his摩托车 burned and still sang, something that even Kennedy would have been embarrassed by?
"Regarding the woman, who is not弱智 but behaves like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I don't know whether this is due to acting or the director's request."
Another thing I'm wonderng is why does韩寒， as a赛车手， seem so interested in adding crash scenes to his movie?
Is it not about adding frustration to给观众？

重庆中等职业教育学校试点现代学徒制，入学即是企业准员工-新华网   This statement can be translated into English as:  Chongqing Senior High School is taking trial of modern master and apprentice system. Upon enrollment, students are considered employees of the enterprise. -新华网
Last night, I was informed by the City University that from this year, our city will pilot the "现代学徒制" talent cultivation model in 60 secondary and junior high schools. Students接受试点培养 will also have the status of apprentices, and will be pre-recorded as employee members after enrollment.
The City University requires to regulate the enrollment and recruitment procedures of higher education institutions and corporate employees, and clarify the双重身份 of apprentice students and corporate准员工. According to the principle of mutual choice, the apprentice, the school, and the enterprise sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but not over 18 years old, the agreement must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise. It is necessary to determine the rights and interests of all parties, as well as specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for apprentices in the active training.
Encourage试点 schools to adopt the modern apprentice form and collaborate with partner enterprises to conduct workforce pre-training and transfer training for employees.
试点学校 need to reform the training and education development model.
The institution and the enterprise jointly design talent development training programs, jointly establish professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master teachers standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program consists of a pilot cycle, in which students'实习时间 is determined according to the professional personnel training plans of the enterprise. The duration of internship in key positions is usually 6 months.
In corporate practice, the company should implement the company team-based management model. Depending on the characteristics of different professional fields, one teacher can lead 2 to 5 students and form a learning group, ensuring that students have a thorough understanding of the skills required for each training position.
According to arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 pilot programs for modern apprenticeship systems in secondary and higher education institutions in the city, with a batch of 50 people for each program. Therefore, a total of about 3,000 students ( apprentices) have been trained through these programs.
According to the principle of piloting before implementing and gradually expanding from point to point, we are exploring the potential mechanism of joint enrollment, jointly training, and integrated personnel education for campus and enterprise. This will effectively improve students' job skills and increase their job satisfaction and quality.

South African physician: Although Omicron's spread is strong, it is mainly associated with mild symptoms.
Many doctors and healthcare experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus are less severe than those caused by the Delta variant, although the spread of the Omicron variant is faster.
According to美联社， with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of over 5000 doctors from the province of Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of patients currently treated by them include relatively mild, similar symptoms to those of influenza, such as pain in the body and cough.
The director, Unben Pillay, says he sees几十 patients a day, but there are still no patients who need to be hospitalized.
P莱说： “他们可以在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复。”  This sentence can be translated into English as:  P莱 said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He stated that this included older patients and those with health conditions, who were generally more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infections.
He said that compared to the previous de塔 epidemic, the patients he treated during the previous wave had "diarrhoea and low blood oxygen levels."
" Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
After the first report of the Omicron变异毒株 in Southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences within two weeks.
Although obtaining enough data will still take several weeks, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some hints.
According to the South African National传染病研究所， a total of 30% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in recent weeks are severe and half of the severe cases were seen in the previous wave of the pandemic. The average length of stay in hospitals has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized recently have died, while the death rate in recent cases in South Africa is as high as 20%.
"Willem Hanekom, head of the African Health Institute，引用data from the National Institute of传染病 Research and other reports said: 'At present, almost all signs suggest that this is a less aggressive disease.' "
He also said, "It's still early, we need to obtain later data."
通常情况下，the time of hospitalization and death occurs later, and we entered this wave of the epidemic only for two weeks.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring the cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the dominant form of the COVID-19 virus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa serving as a hub of the pandemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in Halle-Wagram region in the first week of December increased by 400%. The tests showed that cases of Ormistola variant占比 above 90%.

Education commentary: What makes a difference in saving拐卖儿童的 cases?
If we compare the famous public service advertisements slogan "No trade, no杀害，" to the classic saying "No buying, no selling," then in a good environment without the need for "catch and release," community protection and community governance, as well as the widespread against trafficking, will make trafficking activities profitable, risky, and costly, thus preventing such crimes from recurring.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's criminal investigation department's anti- abduction unit has launched an emergency information release platform for children's disappearances.
This is an online information platform created to establish a authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to promptly locate them.
Upon hearing the name "Unity" of this app, I felt a warm feeling in my heart.
The new technical methods not only have a "文艺" name and a sense of passion, but they also are effective in the use of information technology.
"拐卖执法 is the priority to find and reunite children拐卖ed with their families, protecting their physical safety and rights."
"Secondly, it is the trial and punishment of those suspected of crime."
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed under various categories, including individual punishment, social prevention, and legal education.
However, before the cases of拐卖 are solved, it is important to prioritize the safety of the victims.
Things have轻重缓急之分， under the urgent need for the " retrieval" of children, controversial topics such as "should children be killed for selling themselves?" can be put on hold and discussed with care; but the matter of helping children who are being kidnapped cannot be delayed.
Based on our experience in investigating such cases, human traffickingrs are often willing to flee the scene of the crime as soon as they get away.
The more delay in the rescue operation, the further away the children will be from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will also increase by one degree.   (Note: The translation is based on the assumption that the situation in the original text is about a child being stolen and being taken away by the thief.)
In this situation, coming up with effective ways such as the "Unity" platform that directly help to solve crimes and recover children is indeed a practical action.
After all, "detaining and returning missing children" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
打击犯罪、保障儿童和家长权益，从立法的完善，到司法的保障，以及执法的缜密，无不需要贯彻“护幼扶弱”的关怀。  To combat crime, protect children and their parents' rights, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice and the meticulous implementation of law enforcement, it is necessary to embody the concern for " protecting the young and supporting the vulnerable."
Furthermore, there is still much that can be done to prevent the拐卖 of children, from the family to the society.
For example, a common case involves a family taking a nap at a train station, where the parents are asleep and wake up to find that their children are nowhere to be found.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-defense skills, but as a parent of young children, at least you should have a certain level of protection awareness.
"轮流休息，或将孩子置于稳妥的保护之下，都是预防儿童被拐的最起码手段"的英文翻译是：Both parents taking turns rest, or keeping their children under adequate protection, are the basic means to prevent children from being stolen.
From the other side of the police's efforts to combat拐卖犯罪， the party purchasing the stolen children should also be paying attention to and punished.
The single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Chinese criminal code, the法定刑 for the crime of kidnapped children is 5 years; in particularly serious cases, it may extend to life imprisonment and没收财产.
With a high penalty point and a heavy maximum penalty, under the general trend of "lighting the bar" on criminal punishment, the crime of trafficking in children clearly falls into a more serious category of punishment.
However, there are still many cases of拐卖 that occur each year.
It is evident that some people have backward ideas about raising children and have a weak sense of legal awareness.
The legal education of this group should be continuous and coordinated.
In order to effectively control trafficking犯罪， it is not sufficient to rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If there is a widespread "market" for trafficking, the traffickingrs are motivated by greed and constantly innovate in ways to traffic people, creating a "war" against law enforcement agencies. As a result, the trafficking operation will inevitably fall into an inefficient trap.
Therefore, eliminating outdated beliefs and promoting legal knowledge的普及 also plays a role in根绝儿童拐卖和买卖犯罪。

In the interactive communication phase, senior level representatives from local governments, enterprises, and youth representatives提问ed on the relationship between the three historical decisions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two established", how to grasp the direction of cultural enterprises, and how to draw strength from the history of the Party's 100-year struggle. Yang H Dong provided simple language and vivid examples to answer their questions. He encouraged youth members to draw strength from the Party's 100-year struggle history, to unite closely around the Party central government, and to stay committed to the Party, writing responsibility and responsibilities in their youth dedication.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, and offers five grades of each.
"Unprocessed橄榄油， also known as natural橄榄油， is obtained directly from fresh olive fruits through mechanical cold processing, which removes异物 and produces a liquid oil."
The following can be three different levels based on the acidity:
特级初榨橄榄油(Extra Virgin)：是最高级别、质量最高的橄榄油，是纯天然产品。  Translation: 特级初榨橄榄油(Extra Virgin): is the highest level and highest quality olive oil，是纯天然产品。
The flavor is excellent, with a light and delightful taste of plant aroma, and the acidity should not be超过 1%.
"Fine Virgin": adjective, refers to the oil extracted from the first-stage distillation of olive oil without any refining process. It has a slightly higher acidity but not beyond 2% and a pure, fragrant taste.
普通初榨橄榄油的英文翻译为"Ordinary Virgin"：该词汇表示的是未经过精炼和加工的橄榄油，其口感和风味还不错，但酸度较低，不超过3.3%。
精炼橄榄油 refers to refined橄榄油 produced from initial压榨橄榄油 that has a pH level greater than 3.3, which is often referred to as "二次油".
精炼橄榄油可分为两种级别：
普通橄榄油 (Olive Oil): refined olive oil is mixed with a一定比例 of raw olive oil to调和味道和颜色， the acidity is below 1.5%, and it is呈现出透明的淡金黄色。
精炼橄榄杂质油或橄榄果渣油(Refined Olive-Pomace Oil)：是通过溶解法从油渣中提取并经过精炼而得到的橄榄油。  Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is made from olive waste pieces, which are collected and processed through process of decantation to obtain refined橄榄油.
"After seeing the grading system, you should have realized that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator."
"You need to know that olives, like grapes for winemaking, come from different regions and olive variety, resulting in橄榄油 of varying standards."
"油橄榄的最佳生长地："的英文翻译是 "The best growing place for olive oil":
The coastal areas of the Mediterranean have the ideal soil type and climate conditions for olive oil production, including temperature, sunlight, humidity, and precipitation.
The following is the English translation of the given sentence:  In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only grow small amounts of crops in appropriate areas.
Main production area and location (地中海):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey，葡萄牙， Morocco，叙利亚，以色列， Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan，黎巴嫩， and many other countries in southern Europe, South America, South Africa, and Australia have similar climates.
"油橄榄的采摘月份"：橄榄的采摘季节是每年的3月至5月。
The period from March to June is the time for olive trees to bloom and produce olives. From July to October, the olives begin to grow and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally turning black.
The season for fruit harvesting is from November to February (the freshness of橄榄油 is very important).
橄榄油的营养成分：
橄榄油 is rich in单不饱和脂肪酸， including 油酸 and 亚油酸， as well as 亚麻酸， vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
橄榄油 is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the edible oils discovered so far.
The democratic summit has come to an end, and Biden has said that the flame of freedom will never be熄灭.
The online "Summit for Democracy" organized by President Joe Biden and joined by leaders from 110 countries around the world, including governments and civil society, and private sector, ended on Friday ( December 10th).
Biden said in his closing statement that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of every person on Earth, and the authoritarian regime will never be able to put it out.
He also expressed his plan to hold the second global " democratic summit" next year.
The official representative of the Chinese government, Tang飞翔， and the Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Luo Guang聪， who is currently living in英国， also spoke at the subsequent summit.
Biden said, "We know the work that lies before us is incredibly difficult."
"But we also know that we can face challenges, because as I previously mentioned，正如this峰会所表明的，民主世界 is everywhere."
The authoritarian regime will never be able to extinguish the small flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere.
Biden also said that preserving democracy requires a collective effort from throughout society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the firewall of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and better resist the force of authoritarian缓冲 and impact, as well as those who want to pursue权力 nakedly before公共利益."
The second day of the democratic峰会 focuses on protecting human rights, strengthening democracy, countering authoritarianism, and defending democratic values.
This day is particularly noteworthy as the International Day for Human Rights.
In his opening statement on that day, Secretary General Goodtiz also stated that the democracy project faces challenges globally, particularly from emerging digital technologies.
He said, "It is time to reinforce our common values and positions, as well as our democratic resilience."
This requires furthering social dialogue to address issues of inequality, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires strongly谴责ing all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremistism, including using all the tools provided by the technology革命.
Run Guangqiao, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist, spoke at the峰会 through a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong, ethnic minorities such as the维吾尔族 and the藏族 in China, and to prioritize their rights and interests.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
"We must utilize all that we have, including what we have available, to ensure the revitalization of democracy as our top priority."
Luo Guang聪 also呼吁 the free world to unite to face the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, " Perhaps some of you are afraid of惹恼ing Comrade Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose China's market, or perhaps some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values posed by the Chinese Communist Party."
And that is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.
During the roundtable discussion on "打击数字独裁主义，肯定民主价值", Tang Xuan凤， the representative of the State Council's Executive Committee for Civil Affairs, released a "National Statement" through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of对抗专制 and霸权.
He also shared his experience in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
He said: "At the moment when Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we have always been steadfast on the front line of global resistance to authoritarianism. We are also playing a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments across the world have合理化ized human rights violations under the pretext of public health and collective interests, showing a trend of倒退 in global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to封城 to control the epidemic, and we do not need to remove the apps to defeat fake information.
At the same time as the schedule of the第三天 of the "Democracy Summit" was being held, the US Department of Finance announced that it would enforce sanctions under the law against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries that were found to have seriously violated human rights, while also implementing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.

Hello, the restaurant送来的 raw口水鸡 was delivered.
I want to try playing tennis, but I am afraid I may not be able to stick to it, so I want to try out for a while and find a price that works for me.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you cannot distinguish, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheaper ones, and these "beginner cameras" are actually industrial garbage.
These are very weak, when the ball hits the bat, there is a very large vibration, hard balls cannot withstand them, and high-ranked players are very difficult to control.
The logic and undertone of these exist is——网球这么难， knowing that you cannot learn it, and also knowing that you are not willing to buy expensive items, so we will give you a cheaper version to fool you, you play twice and then you will no longer play, so this ball is cheaper, you are not willing to spend money on it.
"等你真的能够分辨好坏时，说明你已经进步了。到时候再来我这里买贵的，我能让你赚两次钱。"   A possible English translation for this sentence is: "Once you can distinguish good from bad, it means you've improved. When you come back and buy something expensive from me again, I'll make you earn twice."
suggest you spend the same amount of money to buy a second-hand better击球拍， choose prince or邓禄普 brands, these two brands are quite unknown, so good击球拍 cannot be sold at a high price, new击球拍s are 500, 600 yuan, and second-hand ones are 200 yuan, would it not be delicious to have the pleasure of playing with a high-end 1000-yuan击球拍？
The这句话的英语翻译是：It is friendly to beginners, but once they pass the beginner stage, it becomes鸡肋. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The delivery date of the order has been delayed multiple times.

There is a lot of attention paid to clothing搭配 for women who are slightly overweight.
The skirt that a girl with a胖 body should wear should not be too short or too long, just about the length of my knees, and it should just cover the area of her thigh that is thick.
The short dress reveals the obesity on the legs.
"过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。" 的英语翻译是：A long length gives the impression of being矮 and fatty.
If you divide your outfit into three sections: top, bottom, and accessories, it will give the impression that you have naturally grown taller. For example, using different colors for your top, skirt, and long-toed socks will create a sense of length and修瘦感.
In fact, many dark colors are a common sight among slightly overweight girls (which the author is well aware of), and darkness can be an excellent way to隐藏 body fat. Additionally, elegant black short dresses are also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black short dresses, will make people think you are a bit thinner.
If your小腿 is physically large, do not wear your socks and shoes too attention-grabbing.
"The more大众化 it is, the more should it not be too vivid," is the translation of the Chinese sentence "越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了."
"以避免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。"  A possible English translation could be:  "To avoid giving the impression of being overweight when people are paying attention to your legs and feet."
"For girls who are slightly slightly overweight, there are some tips for dressing well that you should always keep in mind."
Don't wear a tight-fitting short skirt for微胖 girls, and never wear a top that is too short or is stuck inside the skirt, which can make people look uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, wear black long-johns or网格 stockings (with the细格子 ones), choose a soft and colorful wide-brimmed hat, and wear a soft and colorful喇叭裙 with a open-neck top, which can fully cover the shortcomings of those who are naturally thick.
Of course, the matter of wearing short dresses for微胖 girls is also significant.
When wearing a short skirt, fat girls should choose a上衣 with a consistent color to the short skirt, so that it will have an effect of increasing height while showing off their fat bodies.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your两条腿 look more修长， and this is the most popular outfit for the summer!
If you are a girl with a round belly on the upper body but a slender leg, I recommend choosing a luxurious short dress.
"Not only can it cover your large belly, but it can also showcase your strengths."
The A-line skirt will definitely make you look taller and slimmer, and it is more suitable for girls with larger waists. You should choose a tightly-fitting上衣 to create depth and make you look even slimmer.
" simplicity is the key - wear a white T-shirt with a short skirt, and even overweight girls can try."
A slightly overweight girl can also wear fashion sense.
As long as they can master the principles of clothing搭配，矮胖的女孩子们 will also be the focus of attention.
After making changes in our clothing搭配， we should also exercise more in life. We want to break the label of "overweight women" as soon as possible.

Last night, the public information officer of Hangzhou police District 2, West Lake branch told新京报记者 that this girl's name is Ji Jiali, and she is募捐ing for her elder sister Ji Jiayan.
However, due to the still-required amount of over $30,000 for treatment, we were unable to come up with a suitable fundraising solution at the time and had to make this decision.
He said that during the entire process, two girls took turns being the target and one took care of backup, but they did not participate in the act. There were no shots fired during the entire process, only someone was围观 and took pictures of the event on Twitter.
After assessing by the police department, the used arrows were determined to not fall within their control parameters.
The official statement did not recommend taking such sensationalistic fundraising methods.
After being commanded by the police officer at the police station, she had already left the station.

What was the most popular in 2021?
"无疑是东京奥运会"的英语翻译是 "It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics 2020."
Do you think only athletes at the Olympic Games can win awards?
In recent times, a popular article called "Please see! Project managers can冲击 gold metals in Olympic sports" was on the rise. It mentioned that project managers, on many occasions, can excel and no one can match them: working as heroes, traveling, and working under theclock are their daily routine, and solving problems，背锅， and apologizing are not a problem at all.
This article, which seems to be a lighthearted and humorous piece, also reveals the daily hardships of project managers. The背后代表的是 their inadequacy in managing the current project work.
"And those who work in project management are also gradually choosing to摆脱 their working conditions by taking some actions."
From the growing number of participants in the PMP (International Certification for Project Management Professionals) exam each year, it can be inferred that an increasing number of project management professionals are seeking to improve their project management skills through learning.
According to the "20th anniversary development report of Chinese project management (1999-2019)", up to September 2019, the total number of PMP® registrations in China was近60 million people, with a total number of 4.2 million people passing the PMP® certification, and about 3 million people with valid certification, accounting for 31.2% of the global total of PMP® certification holders.
The number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing every year in the past decade, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that working without relying on simple套用 past "old experience" is no longer advisable. The constantly evolving work environment teaches us that it is necessary to learn and step into the shoes of scientific giants to explore the path ahead.
However, having a PMP certification does not guarantee the absence of project management problems?
Many beginning project management professionals indicate that by studying PMP/IPMP-related courses, they can acquire a systematic understanding of the ten major areas and the five major process groups related to project management, but it still remains a void when it comes to actual project management work.
Many project managers often report the following issues: lack of understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having only theoretical knowledge of project management, and not knowing how to apply it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, making it difficult to get things done, estimating projects incorrectly, having poor control and sensitivity, and causing projects to be delayed; unclear team roles and responsibilities, "经验丰富的老油条" not knowing how to handle the team, and cross-departmental collaboration communication not smooth, making it difficult to push forward the project.   Note: This translation is based on the context of the original text and may not be perfect.
Therefore, with a focus on product innovation and research and development management for more than a decade, Chien-Ming Chang consulting has helped numerous outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of research and development key personnel such as product managers and project managers.

This is also a chance for businesses to promote the training process of project managers at a lower cost and less investment, bring high-performance results to the company.
Here's the English translation:  "We can't rely solely on our words. Let's first look at what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only led by the Zhongshan Honghua team (formerly the Huawei Research and Development Management Team) but also combines the best international project management methodologies with real business scenarios from numerous leading enterprises.

"Jingxin is promoting rational consumption before the Black Thursday event"
This year, the total amount of online支付 transactions during the "11th National Day of Internet Payment" celebration across the country reached 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of discount红包， attention-grabbing online shopping直播， and the once-again benefits for consumers have led to a surge in consumer spending, leaving people to感叹 the stronger national consumption force. At the same time，冷静下来思考 the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer base is also necessary.
Before the “Black Friday” arrival, Jinx International Home Finance Limited (以下简称“Jinx”) issued理性消费 advocacy, reminding广大 users, especially young people, of the importance of establishing good consumer awareness and habits, and拒绝盲目消费和过度消费.
The result of the national consumer finance literacy survey and analysis report released by the People's Bank of China this year shows that the national index of consumer finance literacy is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, the performance of our residents on the financial consumption level is relatively good, but there is significant discrepancies in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and further improvement in basic financial knowledge is needed.
The level of financial literacy among elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be a focus of持续关注 in financial education. The "China Young People's Debt situation Report" by尔森 and the "2019-2020 Chinese Young People's consumer spending report" by China Central Television's Financial News show that the younger generation has a huge consumption potential and credit consumption has become an important route for upgrading consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and almost half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the overall consumption trend among the younger generation is rational, which is in line with the外界贴上的"over consumption"的标签， some young people indeed have excessive consumption and following the crowd behavior, which has resulted in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, even leading to increasing social problems. Enterprise companies should be brave to assume social responsibility and正向引导.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, JXN has been committed to helping ordinary people build their happy lives through high-quality and thoughtful services. We encourage consumers to establish good and correct consumption habits and are fully响应ing the regulatory calls to improve their practical理性的 consumption awareness, especially among younger generations.
In the past few years, JI Holdings has continuously conducted comprehensive and diverse financial knowledge promotion activities targeting young groups, including college students, through various forms of潜移默化 influence, such as organizing innovative practical competition collaborations with top-tier universities in China, to reasonable guide the consumption needs of young groups. This helps to help them establish rational consumption concepts and efficiently plan their consumption needs, ultimately contributing to their accumulation of personal wealth.
On the day of Black Friday，捷信 reminds all our consumers friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct money perspective, resist the盲从症 of over-consumerism and over- borrowing, avoid consumer- loans mistakes, and thus not以免影响 personal credit report and future economic life.
It is important to plan for your spending in advance and make responsible choices about paying back your debts on time.
If you miss the payment, the late payment record will be reflected in your personal credit report, which may have negative consequences for your economic life in the future, including buying a car or housing.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also important to choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the相关机构 have operational qualifications.
In the future, JXI will continue to serve consumers with their mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly update and iterate their products to provide more personalized and diverse services. They will continuously support the general public in improving their financial literacy, helping consumers develop a sense of rational consumption and responsible borrowing, and being their reliable partner for a lifetime.

越南人民报网 -海湾合作委员会应对共同挑战
The停留 points of Prince Muhammad bin Saud include沙特阿拉伯，阿联酋，卡塔尔，巴林 and科威特.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Undertale's男主角， Tetris's protagonist, and his沙特阿拉伯 and its阿拉伯盟友 in 2017 implemented the封锁 of Qatar, leading to the海湾外交 crisis.
In this crisis，沙特阿拉伯，阿联酋， Bahrain, and Egypt have断绝了 their diplomatic relationship with Qatar, and have implemented a complete trade ban on it. They have accused Qatar of supporting恐怖组织， while also having close ties with伊朗.
The foreign policy tensions have greatly impacted the internal cohesion of the Shanghai International Cooperation Organization and have had a negative impact on the economic development of the country in the region.
Four阿拉伯 countries have blocked the land, sea, and air routes leading to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the海湾合作委员会 (CBIC) summit in January 2021, where the海湾国家 signed an agreement on "Unity and Stability" that was调解 by the United States and科威特.
沙特阿拉伯 has resumed the opening of its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking first steps to try to regain their relations with Qatar by任命ing new ambassadors from both countries in the Qatari capital, City of prayer.
The海湾阿拉伯 countries resolving differences to restore their relationship with Qatar出自于 the requirement of Unity in order to protect the interests of each country and regional stability, with the aim of addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the parties agreed to open the first direct land route between the two海湾邻国.
The的通道， which is长达725公里 long, will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of supply chain for both countries' citizens.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Yemen, and both countries' enterprises have signed 13 cooperation agreements with a value of $30 billion.
The visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to the海湾 countries came at a time when Iran was in negotiations with the world's major powers to挽救 the Iran nuclear协议， known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that海湾阿拉伯国家谴责 because it couldn't solve their导弹 problem with Iran.
The海湾 countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term " competitor" and have regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "的威胁" to the regional security.
各海湾国家认为，不解决伊朗导弹问题，不采取行动来遏制伊朗在该地区的活动是有缺陷的。
In the context of the lack of satisfaction among major powers and Iran's nuclear negotiations with the海湾 countries，沙特阿拉伯 and Iran开展了 direct negotiations.
The goal is to mitigate the upgrading of the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors that can slow down the economic growth of the countries in the海湾 Cooperation Council.
The upcoming Hainautnaut Summit will be the first summit of the Hainautnautnaut countries since the dispute with Qatar was resolved.
This is the opportunity for the海湾 cooperation committee to reconsider the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the promotion of the restoration of Hegemony and Unity of the League of Nations, while proposes measures to enable its member countries to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and making contributions to the stability and development of the海湾 countries.
There has been no delivery since 7:00 PM until 9:30 PM, and we must return the payment and cancel the order.

The low-rise body, aggressive split door, large air intake channels throughout the body, and a 6.5 v12 engine under glass perfectly embody the spirit ofLamborghini.

The car is too large, and parking it in a standard parking space will be narrow. I fear that I will be hit when the neighbor's car opens the door!
There's a bit lonely because there's no one else in the road. (This is a quote from the editor and doesn't refer to the car owner. Have a great day!)

"Make the university spirit resonate with the spirit of times."
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of management ideas and values that have been accumulated in the development of a university over a long period of time, and is the core of the university's soul.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the诞生 of the first modern-day university in the world, universities have been carrying out a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For our universities, which emerged during times of national crisis, their spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of time. Promoting the values of "ingenia sui" and "修齐治平" and taking up the national爱国主义担当 of "strengthening education and building a strong nation."
Currently, the trend of digitalization and globalization of higher education is becoming more显著， while the global competition in education, technology, and talent is constantly increasing. As a important "供给侧" of higher education, its structural reform is facing前所未有的 opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal for the "Overall Approach to the Construction of World-Class universities and fields of excellence" demonstrates our confidence and determination to move from a large country in higher education to a strong country in higher education. At the same time, it also imposes higher and more updates requirements on the development of universities.
How to strive for rapid progress and achieve world-class status within a short period of time, while still leaving room for improvement, by accelerating the construction of several world-class universities and a collection of world-class disciplines，来实现“兵家必争”战略？
In addition to being confident in their goals, paths, and capabilities, universities should further maximize three advantages: Firstly, the advantage of later arrival, which involves continuously importing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from and studying the experiences of top-notch universities around the world. This can significantly improve academic levels and teaching quality. Secondly, the cultural advantage, which inherits the wisdom and connotations of China's long history of culture, promotes the development of excellent traditional culture，以此凝聚 force, brand塑造， and image enhancement. Thirdly, the advantage of system, which utilizes the advantages of socialism's system, strengthens target驱动， collects consensus合力， optimizes resource allocation, and provides a sustainable and solid guarantee for universities to accelerate catch up with world-class levels.
It is particularly important to realize that building top-notch universities is not possible at every institution, and each school must showcase its unique qualities and strengths while发挥自己的优势.
"The unique features of corporate governance should not only include common Chinese characteristics but also reflect individual unique goals, teaching traditions, and resource allocation."
For浙江大学， we focus on highlighting three distinct features in our educational programs: first, we emphasize the突出创新创业人才培养特色， constructing an integrated curricular framework and a mixed-use enterprise-education environment that combines education and research, forming a comprehensive entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we emphasize the clustering of disciplines, promoting the optimization and adjustment of discipline systems, creating a的制度 environment for disciplines cooperation, actively nurturing emerging disciplines and标志性 cross-discipline achievements; third, we emphasize the features of the educational system and social services, engaging in in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a broad浙江大学 industrial, economic, and scientific research and education cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to uphold the university spirit and resonance with the spirit of times.
For Zhejiang University, the校训 "精勤求是，创新超越" and the common values of "learning hard, improving moral character, distinguishing between truth and falsehood, and being sincere and hardworking" as well as "incorporating rivers and mountains, opening up the world to true and profound values, establishing our nation and promoting progress" form the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important保障 for schools to maintain the right direction of teaching and continuously accumulate cultural heights and精神力量， which has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
In this context, "Hei纳江河" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the capacity to use "all the talents in the world" and the willingness to acquire high-quality concepts for teaching and nurturing students at world-renowned universities. "Zhou真厚德" highlights the spirit of seeking truth and creating good character, suggesting that universities should not only pursue knowledge but also receive the cultivation and education of character and personality. "Xue物前民" embodies the spirit of innovation and reform, including the pursuit of new knowledge and scientific innovation, as well as the transformation and innovation of existing things. "Li树我邦国" emphasizes the spirit of national loyalty and dedication, suggesting that universities should always be associated with the success and failure of the nation's destiny.
This series of spirit and value pursuits are the core of Zhejiang University's 120-year teaching experience.
The English translation of this phrase is "A wise person hears in the silence, and a bright person sees into the depths of things before they have formed."
China's universities should further establish themselves in the overall context of the socialist construction project, deeply grasp the historical and时代方位 of higher education, and accelerate their rapid development to become top-notch universities in the world.
At the same time, holding dear the values of humanistic人文关怀 and individual independence and自由， allowing the spirit of the university to stimulate the spirit of the times, and the national spirit, providing an endless source of动力 for national prosperity and national revitalization, and achieving the common dream of humanity.

As NFTs quickly emerge on the blockchain, a new concept has emerged in the加密 community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a significant impact in the Southeast Asia region. Players who had lost their job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn a steady income through this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-养成 game based on blockchain technology, which集合s multiple gameplay elements including NFTs. It is currently the highest-交易额 NFT project and has already exceeded $3 billion at the current time.
TokenTerminal's data shows that the daily revenue of Axie Infinity has exceeded $8.2 million, reaching levels that are紧逼《王者荣耀》。
On August 6th of this year, the official Axie Infinity website said that the daily active users had exceeded 10 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will introduce a new "play to earn" model to more people, thanks to the help of blockchain and smart contracts. With this mode, players no longer have a single role. In addition to gaining乐趣 and economic rewards from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game's ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game creators, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a news article about a friend's stock price, my biggest revelation was the choice of companies over the赛道， which refers to the choice of investment industries for target companies. Firstly, it's important to choose industries with large growth space, at least with a market capitalization of 10 billion or more. Secondly, it's important to choose industries with good future growth prospects, considering industries that can reach the optimal growth state within 3-5 years from now. Finally, it's important to choose industries with government support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
"为对的赛道加油！" 的英语翻译是 "Drive in the right direction!"

The strategy在于 finding direction, while tactics在于 putting it into action. There is space for strategic thinking above and beyond most tactical considerations.

The Chinese national Asian American group filed a complaint against three Ivy League universities, including耶鲁大学， for discriminatory recruitment practices. -新华网
The following is the English translation of the sentence:  新华社华盛顿5月23日电(记者徐剑梅)"On May 23, 2023, more than 130 Chinese-American organizations filed complaints with the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice against three Ivy League universities -耶鲁大学，布朗大学， and Harvard University - for discriminatory practices in their recruitment processes against Chinese-American applicants."
The Asian裔 Education Alliance held a press conference the same day in Washington D.C.
The president of this group, Zhao Yuing, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the criteria for admission to top universities in the United States has doubled, but the ratio of Asian students among these three top universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called " holistic assessment" Admission process of these universities, "long-term and systematic racism against Asian application students" is present.
Zhao Yuquan explained that according to research by桑德斯 and others in 2014, among these three universities, the percentage of applicants among Asian students was the lowest among all groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivies，布朗大学 and Trinity College have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students, while耶鲁大学 and布朗大学 have实施ed actual种族 quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yuxiang told News Corp journalists that they expected the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to conduct investigations after submitting the complaints, and to take measures after realizing the facts to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in recruitment.
They also hope that the universities投诉ed can take proactive steps to address this issue and change their hiring policies towards ethnic minorities.
Currently, the three universities that were投诉ed have not yet made a response.
The Asian American Educational Alliance was established in 2015, and at that time, it filed a complaint against Harvard University's recruitment歧视， but the United States Department of Education did not accept it for processing due to procedural reasons.
The groups participating in the appeal this time include not only American Chinese groups but also American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory facility located in Yueyang, Zhejiang from a house中介. After visiting the facility on multiple occasions, Mr. Lu decided to purchase it.
In December of that year, Mr. Liu consulted with the family of the owner of the factory, Lin, about the details of the purchase of the factory, and on the same day, transferred 20 million yuan through a bank transfer as a deposit.
The sentence in English translation is: "Lin某， as the seller, signed the contract of purchase and sale of factory equipment on the contract of payment of advance payment, which states that, 'If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this advance payment shall be returned to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell this factory, the advance payment shall be双倍返还 to the seller. The parties agree to sign the factory equipment purchase contract within one week from the date of this contract."
However, the parties could not reach consensus on key contract terms such as the sale scope of the factory, payment terms, and eventually did not sign the housing contract until late.
Considering that the two parties couldn't agree on the contract terms, a few days later, Lin某 returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
The English translation for the phrase "好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差"临门一脚"签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒" is:  "After spending a lot of effort finding a property, the down payment was made, and the property price was ready. Just when it was about to make the final step to sign a contract, the seller did not sell, leaving Mr. Lu feeling frustrated and angry."
Therefore, Mr. Liu has filed a lawsuit against Lin某 at the余姚市人民法院.
After consideration, the court believes that the parties' inability to finalize a binding agreement cannot be attributed solely to the plaintiff and should be reasonably inferred as a result of mutual incapacity, thus excluding the application of the deposit fee principle in this case. The plaintiff is not required to pay the compensation for the breach of contract caused by the defendant's failure to return the deposit in twice its original amount.
After the first appeal is heard, the applicant files a second appeal.
Recently, the second court maintained the original judgment.
"Lawyer alert": Make sure to exercise the necessary due diligence obligations during the transaction process.
When entering into a contract, the buyer should fulfill their necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the ownership information of the property and ensuring that the house is not being occupied, and in the contract specify the specific date and location of delivery in order to prevent disputes between the parties when carrying out the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" last Friday, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, who was attending the summit, spoke by phone on December 11th (the day before Christmas) and stated that the United States' hosting of the " Leaders' Democracy Summit" was "to划线 on political ideology, to democratize and weaponize民主， to use the name of democracy to advance counter-democratic measures, to stir分裂 and confrontation, and to转移 domestic矛盾."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has强加于人 its political system and value concepts, promoting '民主 transformation', applying单边 sanctions extensively，策动ing the 'color revolution', and causing catastrophic consequences."
"民主" has already become a "large-scale杀伤性武器" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is a的行动 to fulfill Biden's campaign promises.
The two-day conference was conducted in virtual format, and 111 national leaders from around the world were invited to participate, including the leaders of Taiwan. However, China and Russia did not receive邀请.
Before the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States had no right to host such a summit.
There are also质疑声音 from the international community and the United States, such as criticism that the leaders invited to the summit include some who have a tendency towards authoritarianism, such as those from countries like the Philippines，波兰， and巴西. Some people suspect that the true purpose of the Biden administration's organizing this summit was not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Prime Minister, Angela Merkel, also attended a video democratic峰会.
The statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is in a state of病态， with issues such as money politics, identity politics, political polarization, party对立， political polarization, social分裂，种族矛盾， and income inequality getting worse." It referred to American democracy as a "luxury game" built on capital, saying it is a "rich-vs.-rich competition" that has turned into a "rich-vs.-all" struggle.
In his statement，美国总统拜登 said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the firewall of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and better withstand the force of专制 and its缓冲 and impact. We also have a responsibility to protect the公共利益 of the people before seeking power recklessly."
He emphasizes that democracy is not something that can be assumed, "We must update it with each generation. In my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
By Biden also said that when全球 democracy and human rights are facing continuous and令人担忧 challenges, democracy needs warriors to defend.
The United States has promised that after this democratic summit, a one-year effort will be launched, including an initiative with a funding of 4.244 billion dollars, aimed at strengthening democracy in the world and providing support to independent media outlets.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments before the实体 democratic峰会 is planned for the end of 2022 to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let's all do our part and report on the progress we've made by next year."
Sure, I am afraid he got the address wrong.

"Education reflection: How university exams can ensure that '学霸' and '学渣' reach their full potential - CNN"
Three students from Lanzhou University wrote to the school leadership, reflecting on their confusion about university exams and proposing the demand for increasing the difficulty of exams, changing exam formats, and truly reflecting students' actual levels.
Yes, indeed, university exams have been a popular topic for a long time.
In the university's campus, students come from different regions around the world, with varying levels of ability and learning progress, so the situation of learning is greatly different.
The assessment of a group with such diverse characteristics contains different perceptions, which is inevitable.
Of course, if the exam questions have a single type, high repetition rate, and are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different experience.
A student who doesn't work hard may pass the exam by studying for a few days before the exam. If they can find other ways, they may achieve a better result.
Under this condition, there emerges a strange phenomenon where " below average students" can pass with little effort, even earn good grades; and "high-performing students" never miss a class, excel in their assignments, and still didn't get too much higher grades in exams.
As it seems, the students of Lanzhou University of Science and Technology indicate that the problems found in university exams are not arbitrary, and it is believed that this condition is not limited to Lanzhou University of Science and Technology.
In this sense, I would like to promote the three students who wrote straightforwardly.
In fact, everyone who has studied at university knows that突击复习， trying various ways to obtain test questions from teachers，划清考试范围， and obtain "key study materials" before the exam is not a rare occurrence. Even the case of夹带小抄 during the exam and asking the teacher to give them a higher hand after the exam is not a uncommon sight.
According to the author, as a direction for evaluating the quality of teaching and learning, the question of whether a university exam passes or fails is more about the comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning by teachers, as well as scientific propositions based on it.
Upon entering university, majors begin to specialize, and many major courses focus primarily on fundamental knowledge.
Undoubtedly, mastering the basic concepts of a subject is the subject matter that大学 exams考察.
"And undergraduate knowledge is largely based on basic principles and common sense of each discipline. From a perspective of知识点， there is not much room for change, and it is largely fixed."
As one teacher said, "If you learned the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago, you still are studying it and it is still the main focus."
However, the basic concepts remain constant, this does not necessarily mean that the test formats are单一 and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams typically form a出题 team, which then organizes the exam papers together. The exam review process also involves the participation of all teachers who teach the subject, thus overcoming the situation of identical questions.
However, to create a set of questions that match the practical teaching and learning needs, the questions should be designed based on the overall learning situation of students, with difficulty呈 bell-shaped distribution. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively understand the teaching situation and analyze the level of learning of students. This will enable the exam questions to have a dynamic understanding of difficulty and types of questions, highlighting the考察 of fundamental knowledge and兼顾能力考查， while also innovatively designing types of questions.
The exam is the arrow of university education. Whatever exams there are, students will have corresponding study plans. On a long-term basis, this will have an impact on the effectiveness of university education.
For the students' suggestions, the校方 of Lanzhou University is highly concerned and has already deployed a solution for improvement throughout the university.
Please provide the English translation of the following sentence:  "Requirements for teaching units to organize teachers to carry out discussions and comparative assessments of course exams at the end of the course, develop examination question paper formulating and related policies, and at the same time strengthen oversight and monitoring of examination question paper formulating and review processes，细化 grading, and enhance comprehensive assessments across various aspects of course teaching."
Solving the issues of单一 type of questions and repeated questions through mechanisms is a problem that大学考务 needs to face. Of course, corresponding institutions need to be established. However, the key is in daily practice, which requires teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of teaching conditions. We need not only to understand the teaching content but also to understand the learning conditions of students. We need to understand both ends, so that teaching and learning can better match and form a positive interaction. This will also make the exams more realistic, thus giving "学霸" and "学渣" equal opportunities.

Golden miss摄影(South Street store) 暂时还没有分店
Before the photo session, we had to change the schedule twice because we didn't manage our time well. Our consultation agent兰兰 was patient and helped us arrange the schedule with ease.
Later, I chose to take photos during a good weather weekend.
The staff of Mrs. Goldfield, whether as consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are absolutely fantastic.
That's my first time正式 dressing up for a formal event in my life, and Wow! I couldn't believe it when I realized that one day I would look so beautiful. Ha ha!
Xiao jie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are very patient when化和 dressing, and their makeup looks very natural.
The external photo was taken in Jiang湾城， and Fortunately, the weather was good that day and we didn't feel cold. During the photography, the makeup artist always paid attention to our clothes and jewelry, and if anything went wrong, she immediately helped us tidy up as soon as possible.
摄影师 are also very funny, they feel happy all day after taking pictures.
When selecting images, because of seeing many cases on the internet, we are not willing to allow the clients to remove too many photos. However, when we were selecting images, we really did not have any intention to add more photos to the套餐. We selected the 24 images included in the package without any additional fees. (I heard that my表妹 who拍摄婚纱照 was charged an additional 1,500 for a package that cost around 7,000, and I was amazed at the time. I also担心自己 would choose too many images.)
"The photos were finished today and ran ran sent it to me. I saw two of them didn't like them, and they immediately helped me retouched them."
Look at the photos of my sister that I have pulled out from time to time, and I truly feel that we have produced some beautiful and satisfied pictures. Simple and fresh, they just meet my requirements for style.
I heartly recommend that everyone visit Qingh航拍摄影！
The package price is 3,999 yuan.
"The golden lady感恩s to have you, and with all my heart, I wish you happiness, success, and a bright future!"

The commentary of The People's Daily: A good start with the "145th Central Committee Economic Work Conference" - On the implementation and learning of the spirit of the Central Committee Economic Work Conference.

"We have achieved a positive start to the '145th anniversary' year," the Central Economic Working Conference held from December 8 to 10 highly praised the achievements of China's economic and social development in the past year.

We celebrate with great pride the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China's founding. We officially declare the establishment of a complete and comprehensive socialist modernization country, achieving the first century's goal, and embark on a new journey towards the second century's goal of building a socialist modernized country.
We held the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which summarized the significant achievements and historical experience of the party's 100-year struggle.

"The十四五规划 has achieved a good start, an important aspect of which is the迈出ment of new steps in constructing a new development pattern and the achievement of high-quality development results."
The Chinese economy has maintained global领先地位 in terms of its development resilience, huge potential, and strong motivation, continuously demonstrating characteristics such as strong resilience, large potential, and strong动力. National strategic scientific and technological forces are acceleratingly growing, with significant innovative achievements emerging, continuously improving scientific and technological innovation capabilities, and achieving new breakthroughs in key core technologies. The industry chain resilience has been improved, with an increase in foreign trade volume and quality, and the structure continues to be optimized. New emerging technologies, such as those representing new industries, new models, and new modes of operation, have grown and strengthened. Efforts are being made to deepen the reform and opening up, focusing on打通 bottlenecks that restrict the matching of supply and demand and the movement of resources, and cultivating new advantages through high-quality open-door policy. The reform and opening up have been efficiently implemented, with the scale of employment continuously expanding, the growth of household income基本同步 with the economic growth, and the food price has been maintained at over 1.3 billion tons for seven consecutive years, achieving the "十八连丰". The environmental protection and ecological development have been continuously advancing, with efforts to achieve carbon peak and carbon中和 in a coordinated manner, the green and low-carbon transformation is steady, and new results in environmental protection have been achieved.
The achievement of these results is the result of the resilient leadership of the Central Committee under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee and the scientific guidance of Xi's New InternationalStyle. It is the result of the joint efforts and struggle of the entire Party, people from all over the country, and all ethnic groups.
The practice has once again demonstrated that the Party has established the central, central, and core position of the Party Central Committee and the entire Party in Xi Jinping's circle, and established the guiding position of Xi Jinping Thought on Social equality and Nationalism with a fierce determination to promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the new era.
With Xi Jinping as the core leader of the Central Committee and the core driver of the party, there is a scientific guide to China's New Strategic Policy, and the Unity and determination of the party and the people of all countries in China, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve new achievements in the new journey of building a socialist modern country.
The二十大 of the Party will be held next year, which is a significant event in the political life of the Party and the State.
Promote the great founding spirit, maintain the overall work tone of progress and improvement, fully, accurately, and thoroughly implement the new development strategy, accelerate the construction of a new development landscape，全面深化改革开放， adhere to the driving force of innovation, promote high-quality development, and maintain the main focus of structural reform and economic development，统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展，统筹发展和安全， continue to do the "Six Stability" and "Six Protection" work, continuously improve the living standards of people, strive to stabilize the macroeconomic landscape, maintain economic operation within the reasonable range, and maintain the overall stability of the society.

It requires personnel leaving a land border city within the last 14 days (except those with borders connected with Hong Kong and Macao) to obtain a negative test result for核酸检测 within 48 hours, and personnel arriving in a land border city will至少 undergo a test once after arrival."
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date when the borders city的范围 were determined and announced by the local governments of each province and city, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice proposes that border cities with conditions can study the setting up of ecological protection buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The official of the National Health and Social Security Commission's disease prevention and control division introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic支柱 and the frequent exchange of border residents between the two sides.
Here's the English translation for the given text:  Implement分区差异化 management policies, transforming one comprehensive prevention and control barrier into two separate barriers, with the hope of achieving a shift in control points, reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading, and achieving the maximum impact on epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost.
In recent times, several local clusters of infectious diseases have occurred in our country, all of which were imported from outside through border cities.
The above notification indicates that this has resulted in the following issues: in some places, timely epidemic monitoring and alerting have not been implemented, closed-loop management of high-risk positions has not been落实， regular health tests have been in place in form, inadequate cleaning and消毒 of ice-cold chain components have been done, and inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, as well as insufficient scientific and accurate response to epidemic situations.
The notice requires efforts in 9 aspects, such as improving border control measures, strengthening health prevention and control mechanisms in border cities, and fulfilling the monitoring and warning systems, to speed up the filling of shortcomings and weaknesses in border cities' prevention and control, strictly adhere to the prevention and control work without relaxation, and build a strong defense line against external input through dense deployment.
The notice emphasizes that cities at border ports should conduct parallel research and deployment of epidemic prevention and public health support tasks, publish and prioritize public health support hotlines, regularly investigate early warning signs in the fields of basic life assistance supplies and prices, and promptly address and respond to the key issues raised by public requests.
According to the notification, the cities referred to in this warning include the county(city, district, flag) where the road, waterway, and air interface are open, the city(state, county, league) where the interface is open, and the capital city. The specific scope is determined and announced by the各省(自治区、直辖市) according to the need for public health prevention and control.

Here is the English translation of the phrase:   "On YouTube, a video exposing the truth of the US military's 20 years of bloodless violence and killing has been uploaded -新华网"
The video source is from YouTube.
On December 11th, a micro-video titled "的机器" on the YouTube channel caused widespread attention.
This film tells the story of the US launching the阿富汗战争 under the name of " anti- terrorism,"强行 exporting American democracy through the war, becoming reckless and的血液循环， killing innocent civilians for 20 years, committing numerous human rights abuses.
The translation of the phrase "滥用无人机空袭医院、学校等民用场所，扭曲人性，成立杀人小组" is:  "The abuse of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools扭曲了人性，建立了杀人小组."
20 years ago, the US military killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in阿富汗.
The US military has established "black sites" to apply various forms of torture and human羞辱 to "嫌疑人s."
Each piece of anti- Humanity crime激起s more hatred among阿富汗 people.
As mentioned in the video, the American "反恐" war is "reversing its counter-terrorism efforts and becoming more terrorist."
The war did not bring peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of阿富汗， but only a devastated country and countless killing and destruction.

I came across a article accidentally that discusses why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded warehouse to help with packing. Although packing is a high-level processing and does not fall within the scope of the bonded warehouse logistics company, this article may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have been to many milk production companies and had contact with many milk production lines.
"Actually, the packaging of罐装 and听装 breast milk is exactly the same, with no differences at all."
So, people will definitely ask why the保质期 of boxed products is one year, while the保质期 of listening装 products is two or more years?
"Or do you also ask why the price difference between boxed and unpacked versions is so significant?"
"Actually, from this perspective, many consumers, or even mothers, believe that because the raw materials are different, the quality will be much better."
"Actually, the raw materials are the same, but everyone believes that the one that is expensive is good."
There are also consumers who have reacted after consuming it that the taste or texture of听装 is different from the original!
"现在我跟大家先说一下听装贵的原因，贵在哪里？" 的英语翻译为：  "Now let me take everyone's attention and first explain to you why listening versions are expensive. What are the reasons for their expensiveness?"
Why is the difference so significant between the prices of these products with the same raw materials?
The English translation for the sentence is: "Because manufacturers usually consider that if the price of packaged goods is too high, consumers may not be able to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is low, or there is no profit. What do manufacturers rely on to survive?"
所以他们在听装定价上有了一个很大的上升幅度来保障他们的利润空间。
Therefore, most manufacturers are promoting listening versions rather than boxed versions.
"还有，每年那么多厂家的广告宣传费用都要几千万甚至几个亿，这个费用来源何处？"
"大家可以想象。"的英文翻译是 "You can imagine it."
As society develops, the marketing promotion costs, such as store promotional staff, store display fees, product gifts, and advertising expenses, are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, both inbound and outbound, with continuously rising prices. These are new products that emerge due to the increase in market costs.
The main goal is to obtain a higher profit, and actually the increased cost of raw materials will not go beyond 3 or 4 yuan.
Another part of the brand, in order to promote their products, has不择手段， linked themselves to doctors from hospitals, and assist in the promotion of the product, extracting profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a single bottle.
However, China's legal regulations strictly prohibit such operation methods and practices, which in fact are harmful to consumers.
建议大家在购买袋包装的奶粉时，在家里有罐的情况下购买。这样不仅可以节省费用，还可以增加奶粉的保存性和密封性。而且对于小孩子来说也没有任何影响。
"Another thing, don't think that听装的保质期 is longer than boxed versions. If the听装 and boxed versions have the same保质期 after opening the box, it just means that the boxed version is less likely to be stored and prone to受潮 and变质."
The delivery was late and the food was cold. After it got cold, it was dry and hard to eat. It's completely impossible to eat.

Don't make people scared to fall behind at the starting line-新华网
When strolling through a book market, one often feels the excitement of success-oriented books.
Many success学 books today promote the "best principle" -- that is, they assume or暗示 that you can "do it" before telling you what the thing you need to do is.
It means that you have directly bypassed the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 - 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。  This is why all these books have a common feature - either you work to the best or you do nothing; either you are 100 or you are 0; either you climb the泰山 or you are just staying at the same place.
This "best principle" would be admitted by anyone as "无比的正确", but 99% of people would be intimidated before starting the race.
因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。  This sentence in English translation is:  因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。
For someone who is stick to old ways, trend-resistant, and resistant to change, making them hear you confidently say "You need to change" in their presence is undoubtedly a delusion and a fool's paradise.
Most people will feel intimidated by the word "转变" and hesitate, making difficult decisions; or they may make a strong determination to "转变" based on a sudden冲动， but it is often short-lived and they may lose their way in the end, making it difficult to see its sustainability.
Mr. March's famous dialogue "From tomorrow on" is the classic that最能传神地表现了 this "common human nature"。
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that it has a too high threshold, often exceeding the capabilities of most people and leaving the vast majority "叹口气 and looking in the wrong direction."
Perhaps, the "次好原则" is just one way that it is possible for more ordinary people to pursue a relatively successful path.
The core of the "次好原则" is " lowering the threshold" - it encourages the theory of " Gathering small victories to achieve great results", that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is also fine: because 1 always exceeds 0. If you can't climb to the top of the mountain, doing just the small在沙滩上的小山丘 at your家门口 is also fine, because it's better than standing still.
In a word, anything you do is better than not doing anything.
Due to a significant reduction in barriers, there is more likelihood for ordinary people to persist in their efforts, and as a result, the probability of success is also increased.
"The path to success, following the '次的好的' principle, is just slightly longer than others."
In short, while the "best principle"打着 the的名义 of making everyone successful, it ultimately can only motivate a small minority；相比之下， the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and make the most impact on as many as possible.
"那我现在是否需要重新下订单？"的英文翻译是： "Is it necessary to place a new order now?"。

Could you please let me know when the package will be delivered?
How can I contact you?
"Please cancel the Order."
"I can't wait any more. Thank you."
He hasn't delivered two meals yet, but one order has been completed.
"I'm thinking of asking how to contact the driver."
Just then, the first骑手 told me that there should be another骑手 coming to deliver again.
The total resource reserves of wild鲤 in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's Lake Qinghai have increased by 710,000 tons this year, according to a news article from新华网.
The latest monitoring results show that the total amount of Baiji River white fish resources in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is a total increase of more than 40 times compared to the early days of protection in 2002.   Note: The above translation is a rough approximation and may not fully reflect the actual tone, language, and syntax of the original text.
The common name of the raw鲤鱼 in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is "Hángyǒu fish", which is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It has a crucial role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human-induced large-scale fishing, the number of white fish in the青海湖 has decreased significantly, and in 2002, the available stock of white fish in the青海湖 was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the dragon Lake paddlefish was listed as endangered in the Chinese物种 Red List.
From 2003, the State Council in China has implemented the fish farming and resource conservation policy of lake Qinghai. It has prohibited any unit, group, or individual from fishing raw fish and its products in the main rivers and streams of Lake Qinghai and the western lake region.
Meanwhile, by continuing to enhance protection efforts through artificial breeding and release, cleaning out the main river channels of the Qinghai-Tibet Lake, and designing科学合理 "fish passage" measures, the amount of white fish resources in the lake has been gradually increasing year by year.
According to Yang Lin, the vice president of the Ministry of农业 and农村 Affairs of the Gansu Province, until now, over 180 million fish have been implemented through artificial breeding and release, making a contribution of more than 23% to the restoration of the natural resources of the Lake Qinghai裸鲤.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source retention area for China and even Asia. The Qinghai-Tibet Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the向东 progression of desertification in the western part of the region.
In order to protect the ecological environment and marine wildlife of the Three rivers source area and the Sea of China lake area, to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, respectively, from the beginning of this year to now, Qinghai has issued禁捕 notices on key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Sea of China lake, and has constructed a comprehensive禁捕 management system of "one river, one lake and one waterway".

It's been 1 hour and still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw a article about menstrual cycles, it's too long.
"科普一下" 的英语翻译为 "科普(科普sī kǎo)一下"。
The English translation for the sentence is: Most girls experience their first menstrual period on a sudden day during the period of 13-15 years old, and stop having periods at around 50 years old.
After maintaining a healthy body, it will regularly occur every month.
However, it is not规律 enough to predict with precision. There is a variation of about a week, and it requires advance preparation. Sometimes, bad luck can cause a disaster ( sudden advance by several days).
The duration, blood volume, and degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person, with some people having a period for three days, while others have a heavy cramp for a week; some people have little bleeding, while others have a large bloodletting; some people experience no reaction, while others are pain-free until the救护车 arrives. menstrual cramps can change with time, and not experiencing them before does not necessarily mean they will not happen again in the future.
The sentence in English翻译为：  "Menstruation cannot be controlled; it bleeding for 24 hours from the start to the end within a few days, and there is only one thing to do: use pads or menstrual cups to吸取 blood to prevent it from flowing into the clothes or chair."
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the production of relaxin. When the menstrual cycle starts and menstrual cramps haven't started yet, taking布洛芬 (Blofeld) can help to alleviate the pain for the current month. However, it doesn't work well if menstrual cramps start before taking the medication.
The sentence in English translation is: "Before menstrual cycle, due to emotional strain and excessive release of hormones such as relaxin, it is common to have diarrhea."
If you're around your menstrual cycle, you might experience sudden diarrhea, and your menstrual cycle usually starts within two days.
The English translation for the sentence "卫生巾最好两三个小时更换一次，不然容易滋生细菌" is: "卫生巾 should be replaced every two hours or more, otherwise it can promote the growth of bacteria."   Note: This translation assumes that the speaker is referring to a menstrual cup as an alternative to卫生巾.
"You don't need to constantly replace your卫生棉条， usually it can be replaced every few hours, up to about six or seven hours, but it's best to do it every quarter to half an hour."
The season of the month with荷尔蒙 imbalance may be more暴躁， and during the period of ovulation, the body's hormones can be unstable, which can lead to emotional不稳定. It's quite unfortunate that the body plays tricks on itself.
"However, official crime statistics can indicate that women have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional issues as an excuse."
The phrase in English translation is: "It's not just blood that flows, it also includes脱落的子宫内膜."
The uterine lining is the most thin after menstrual bleeding ends, and it gradually becomes thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is like a house, building a house (the uterine lining thickening) every month with the intention of welcoming guests. If the guests do not come, the entire house is拆除 (menstrual排出) and new houses are built the next month, repetitively.
"Having a menstrual cycle is not convenient, it happens for decades, there are several days of bleeding every month, and it can cause abdominal pain and backache, who would choose that?"
The English translation of the given sentence is:  "But a person can be born because his mother has eaten a meal during her menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle is preparing the house where you would spend 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for eating a regular and healthy meal during her menstrual cycle."
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and the society brain washed women into believing that they were dirty, ashamed, and what they thought was the case. However, times have changed.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "If someone finds it恶心 to hear about pregnancy and the preparation that a woman's body goes through to give birth, they shouldn't say it out loud in front of a large audience. Women should stand up and stop thinking like this. men who have never experienced it, or will never experience it, and don't know much about it, shouldn't be so irresponsible and disrespectful.How can one have the courage to face one's mother and want to have children with such a attitude?"
Finally, brothers and sisters, try using洞洞巾 properly, and you will see how useful they are!
"Today is the Winter Solstice festival, and送错东西 can be quite disappointing."
I need to make a reservation for a meal for my children.
"I hope that the stores will check the production while being busy."
"足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？"的英语翻译是：Is the water in the bathroon causing麻感 after脚泡脚？
Choosing the right足浴盆 can play a very good role in foot massage保健作用. Today's Chinagoods editor will address this issue and hope to be of help to friends.
With the increasing awareness of health，浴足盆 has become increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of different grades of浴足盆 have emerged on the market. There are plenty of浴足盆 available from一百多 dollars to thousands of dollars, giving consumers a wide range of options.
According to relevant data, sales of health-related appliances such as的脚浴盆 are very popular compared to traditional consumer electronics. However，脚浴盆 do not have specific industry standards, which means there is a potential safety hazard.
"In that带电 water泡脚， it's completely dangerous!"
李先生 telles the journalist that recently, he bought a泡脚盆 as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father takes a soak in the泡脚盆， he feels a sense of麻痛 in his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath would be the cause, but没想到关掉了这个功能， father still felt like his toes were feeling numb.
"Table of contents" for the article:  1. Introduction 2. Background 3. Problem and Solution 4. Conclusion  The English translation for the above sentence is:  李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。
He later contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good. Although he had returned the bathhouse，李先生 still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulations for the current popularity of浴足盆 in terms of setting the highest temperature, suitability for different groups, and ensuring无害 materials.
"However, generally speaking，泡脚盆 will not have electrical problems, but it is also possible that a few products are not thoroughly checked before being shipped out."
Therefore, choose a split-level浴盆 when you buy one.
"水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。"的英文翻译是：  "Water electricity separation, there are no safety risks."
"You can pick up a battery meter to test at the same time."

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for the humane assistance they have provided during the long period of 30 years after our loved ones were killed, especially since I had called for humane assistance on my own behalf at the beginning of 1994 to friends at home and abroad. The assistance provided has never been interrupted until now.
"现如今绝大多数遇难者的老父母均已去世，遗孤们也已长大成家就业。"的英文翻译是：  Nowadays, most victims' elderly parents have passed away, and their orphaned children have grown up and become married and employed.
Your noble gesture helped us through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading globally, and most donations have already retired.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the humane捐款 to our難属 - Tiananmen mother group, as this humane assistance activity should have been completed perfectly otherwise.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your bravery will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I am only able to express my wishes in this way, please accept my apologies!
Please accept my heartfelt wishes.
陶业 note: Please allow me to take this opportunity to provide a brief overview of the history of the International Food Security Group (IFCSS) and the明尼苏达中国民主基金会 (MCDF) in the field of人道主义 assistance.
In the process of providing人道主义 assistance, the African Union, United Nations Association of支那斯坦 Nations and the Foundation for Chinese Democracy in明尼苏达 are two parallel organizations, with project implementations often involving collaboration.
The English translation for the given sentence is:  "Apple Daily Photo: The parent website of Tiananmen mother is managed by stone industry."
The subsidies often cannot be successfully delivered to the hands of those in need, as六四难以属。
In 1994, under the suggestion of Ms. Dan, a specialized group was established by the "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and distribute humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Sixty-Four孤儿教育基金", which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all Sixty-Four孤儿 had graduated from college, the MCDF then established the "六四孤苦老人特困户救助基金", and has been in operation until today.
The funding for these projects largely comes from campus and social contributions in 1964, thanks to generous contributions from individual donors, and is supported by the Democratic Foundation of the Brothers University.
Since 2018, the support of the labor research foundation has also been provided.
until this year, after 31 years, the six-four loyalists finally received a partial contribution from Hong Kong in the name of the six-four fundraising campaign in the year ago.
During this period, the Chinese People's Rights Association was also independently executing their humane assistance projects.
We understand that Dr. Dan stopped the six-four contributions for the sake of donors, and we are indeed some aging adults who do not have as much income as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Dan in this letter for his kind words addressed to our friends.
"We will respect the decision of the difficult members and terminate this project within two years, and if needed, we will promptly resume it."
Thank you and respect to all the brave colleagues who have consistently offered generous donations and risked their own safety to递送 community aid funds for many years.

Model price: $1000.
Thank you for the review of the rabbit. I本来还说拒绝古风 because it is not suitable for traditional Chinese, but没想到 the final product is so beautiful that I could not resist.
Thank you for the recognition of Zdan. Your satisfaction will enable us to continue moving forward with full energy. We will continue to strive for better!
This photography studio is truly excellent! I highly recommend that all of your friends come and visit!

I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.

How do I pay you?

"Now the restaurant employees are calling me."
A beginner编程 who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter this field, you can choose to get trained in a place, but if you don't have that idea, it's best to self-study because the cost of training is very high and you will need to spend 6 months learning.
But if you are planning to get into this field, training is indeed a very good option. especially for those with weak self-control, training is even better.
If one's self-discipline is strong enough, one can also choose to learn on one's own, but it will be quite workload.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a crucial matter.
First of all, look at the strength of the faculty at this institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, then the training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions have not yet reached their full capacity for faculty strength.
"Secondly, inquire about this training institution before making a decision. It's always better to get to know the students who have graduated from this institution, as only they can truly know how well the institution operates and whether the courses offered are good or bad."
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because there's not a certain introduction about my own situation. Learning this thing is very important to me.
For example, your major, age, language of interest, even the city where you want to study or work, all play a role in determining your field of study or career path.
If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you are a computer science graduate, if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study, as this is the least cost-effective option, although many online and offline training institutions are also quite good. However, the learning cost is high, and you will need to invest a lot of time in it. It is generally recommended to集中培训3-6个月。
However, if it is mentioned in the situation I described, self-study is quite convenient. Many learning resources on the internet are free, or you can find many training resources on YouTube. If you do not know how to find resources, you can contact me through the introduction, obtain free resources, or obtain detailed advice.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford the cost of learning and time spend on it, I would suggest joining a training institution. This way, you will not have to work hard to learn, and the teacher will explain the material in detail. Others will also provide specialized answers to your questions. Additionally, joining a training institution can also be helpful in terms of planning or监督 your learning.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referrals spots, and recommend job openings to companies after training, which can save a considerable amount of time during the interview process after finding a job.
Here are my few observations. As I mentioned earlier, because I don't have a clear understanding of your situation, I will provide a general introduction but not a detailed explanation. If you have any other questions you would like to discuss, feel free to contact me and we can have a conversation.
I said to come before 1:00 and I saw it in the app.

Although crystal lights are elegant, they will gradually lose their shine if not cleaned for an extended period. Only after cleaning can they regain their glory. Similarly, life is like this.

However, I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, stick to it, and work hard, I will be better than others. At least it's better than sitting and抱怨！
The best time of the day is early morning, all good things start in the morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and good fortune, and keep a positive mood all day. Good morning!
When we are young, happiness is something that we have, and having it makes us happy; as we grow older, happiness is a goal that we achieve, and doing so brings happiness; after we come of age, we realize that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it brings happiness.
Here's the English translation for the given phrase:  "Keep being the genuine and kind person you are, follow your heart, and never regret your life. There is only one road in life, take your own path. There are two precious things in life: having a healthy body and a happy mind, and look beautiful and young until the end of your life!"
Every stage of life will encounter different challenges.
"很多时候，束缚住你的并不是能力，而是积极面对的勇气." 的英语翻译是：In many cases, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face things positively.
"既然无法躲避，不如坦然面对"的英文翻译是：  "If one cannot avoid it, one should face it head on."
The less you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; the more you persist in the face of challenges, the more they will be solved.
The Chinese and Saudi art exhibitions designers collaborate to hold the first双年展 of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia --新华网
According to新华社利雅得 December 12 (记者 Wanghaizhou and Hua冠), the first双年展 of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia, the迪里耶 contemporary art双年展， opened officially to the public in the迪里耶JAX art district located in the northwest of the capital city of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh on November 11. There were共有来自沙特、中国等地的64位艺术家参展。
The current双年展 was jointly策划 by the Saudi Arabia迪里耶双年展基金会 and the United States College of art华盛顿当代艺术中心. The Director of Art is Thomas Hearns from the United States College of art华盛顿当代艺术中心， and the Secretary-General is Wang Feizy from the Saudi Arabia迪里耶双年展基金会.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this bi-yearly exhibition is " crossing the stream with the help of a stone", which隐喻s the reform strategies adopted during the period of social economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of the Saudi society's cultural development.
The current biennial exhibition covers approximately 9,800 square meters of land, and the exhibition hall横跨 six interconnected buildings. It is divided into six sections: "摸着石头过河" "传承 as experiment" "边缘思考" "走向公众" "美丽新世界" and "论艺术的精神".
Among these, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than four成人 of the total display, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; also, the works of 12 Chinese artists are of great interest, some of which use recycled materials in innovative ways to create, for example, Xu Bing, in "The Story of the Background series之stream and mountain Infinite图" (2014), reconstructs a classic Chinese landscape painting using waste materials.
The CEO of the迪里耶双年展 Foundation, Andy巴克利， expressed his hope that the current双年展 could establish international dialogue, allowing全球 viewers to gain an opportunity to learn about the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthening interaction and exchanges.
The goal of the bi-yearly exhibition is dual, not only allowing Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue but also enabling Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art.
I'm informed that a series of lectures will also be held during the双年展 opening week, where influential leaders in the art, exhibition, and creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication, the development of contemporary art.

According to the official of the State Council Department of Economic Planning in云南省， currently, 448,300 rural public-interest jobs have been developed in云南， which are used to安置 poverty-stricken rural communities with employment opportunities, such as poverty alleviation labor force. These jobs play an important role in helping poverty-stricken communities achieve employment and economic growth, consolidating the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the capabilities of rural public services.

In the aspect of job development and setup, the new policy clarify that job positions are设置 according to the "on-the-job-creation, position-based selection, dynamic management, and total control" principle, "Who creates, uses, and is responsible for the position," and "One person-one position，自愿公开， and overall management."
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, declaration, investigation, review, hire, pre-employment training, and appointment.
In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific roles and responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public-service jobs, the production standards and subsidies for rural public-service jobs, and规定各 rural public-service job development departments should purchase comprehensive personal injury commercial insurance for the employees of rural public-service jobs, as well as require relevant departments to regularly monitor the distribution of subsidies for rural public-service jobs.

But I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, which inevitably leads to social instability, harm to people's lives, political groups presenting a mix of good and bad, and foreign interference.
"IV. Change or improve China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and its people. political投机 attempts to take advantage of the fire without taking any responsibility are not右派， they are criminals."
"再聊聊左" can be translated to "Let's chat about the left again."
The left, in fact, are a group of era and political outsiders.
If the right has positive meanings for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing statements and analyze their ideas when needed. However, the left is no longer capable of this spontaneity, because what the left demands is precisely the trash that the Communist Party discarded!
"五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得我觉得大可不必。"  Translation: "V. 最近看到一些朋友，他们既反驳反贼，又驳斥左派，还动用自己的真气，我觉得这种做法没有必要。"
"Do not try to talk to them about logic. They are both single-minded and cannot understand that there is no logic to speak of."
"Don't try to prove that you are right, nor let the rogues and right-wing fools recognize it. Why bother?"
I tell my friends this way: when the enemy calls you a five-percenter and the leftie calls you a right-wing dog, it恰恰 proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have had dreams when they were younger, but as they get older, they forget about these dreams or pursue them but end up becoming obsessional.
"渐行渐远"的英文翻译是 "got farther and farther away from our goals"。
"To the left and to the right usually refer to constraints and freedom, and historically和文化ly, China's inherent genetic nature leads to a整体 bias towards the left."
The domestic right-wing values freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and focuses more on fairness and security.
The overall society now hopes to focus more on fairness, but at the same time, China and the United States are embroiled in a competition for attention, and there is certainly a tendency to be more left-wing. It is expected to continue for many years.
Although you may not understand, a like button will do the job.
"啥也不说了，花花就是这么仗义"的英文翻译是 "No need to mention it, [Name] is just so kind."
Over the past two years, the封锁 and containment efforts against China's Huawei technology芯片 not only led to an unprecedented crisis for Huawei but also caused significant damage to "US-based" enterprises.
The United States is suppressing the Chinese chip industry, and requires its own enterprises and those of its allies to simultaneously封锁 the Chinese chip industry. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced research and development investments and reduced production capacity of chip manufacturers. This has resulted in a chaotic shortage of chips supply around the world.
"The缺芯 situation has now affected major industries worldwide, such as automotive manufacturers stopping production and phone prices rising.几乎所有 industries that use chips are affected by this situation."
In order to grasp the自主权 of "chips", more and more technological giants in many countries are starting to move towards the "de美化" route.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and牵制 China's semiconductor development, the US has been making frequent moves. It has hosted the "Semiconductor Summit" and邀请了 64 major countries' leaders to form a semiconductor alliance, as well as financing support for American domestic technology giants such as Intel. In order to regain a dominant position in the semiconductor industry, Intel, a classic US technology giant, has invested $20 billion in two semiconductor processing plants in Arizona and started offering semiconductor manufacturing services to the public.
When most people thought that Intel's move would cause a一定冲击 on TSMC, and it was likely to steal TSMC's "business".
The reason why I am so confident is that, as a seasoned American technology giant, Intel has been deeply involved in the semiconductor industry for many decades，拥有 a large talent pool and technical reserves, and undoubtedly will quickly rise and打败 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in the short term.
However, when it comes to Intel's decision, Zhang Zhongmosh, the founder of TSMC, shows no interest at all.
At the "2021 Master智库 Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongkai made some surprising statements. Regarding Intel's decision to build a semiconductor factory at a cost of billions of dollars, Zhang Zhongkai freely直言： "It is quite ironic that Intel is building a chip manufacturing factory."
The reason why Zhang Zhong谋 is such a contemptuous of Intel's entry into the semiconductor field is that he still holds a grudge over a dispute between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Intel 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was regarded as the jewel of American manufacturing, positioned at the forefront of the global market and being the dominant player in the field of semiconductors.
By the mid-1980s, the high-end semiconductor芯片 market in the world was still controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM模式， where the chip was completed by one factory from design to packaging. Intel was an代表 of that time.
However, this mode has caused small businesses to become overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have been unable to avoid major obstacles in the face of massive production line construction costs.
Upon entering the 1980s, under the influence of market demand, the chip industry began to adopt分工 and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhong谋 heard about a company specializing in chip design and thought, since there was a company专门做设计的， it would be appropriate to establish a factory dedicated to pixel manufacturing.
relatively soon, Zhang Zhong谋's idea became a reality, and Tsinghua University KEG was established.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has aimed its main business at a single step, "晶圆加工", where it does not design but only provides design-to-production (DToP) services for semiconductor manufacturing.
When TSMC was just established, they were considered a minor player compared to Intel, which was a giant in the industry.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhong萌芽曾试图找英特尔投资。 But when Intel heard that TSMC only served as the manufacturing aspect of the chip industry, it clearly had a high regard for TSMC and refused to invest in it.
Zhang Zhong谋 also believed that Intel at that time did not value the integrated circuit manufacturing services.
"I never expected the big giant that I看不起 back then to start doing chip processing services today."
Therefore, Zhang Zhong谋 finds it ironic that Intel is entering the field of semiconductor manufacturing.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has passed Intel in terms of market capitalization.
In the face of Apple's strong attack, Intel is naturally not willing to remain isolated.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still停留ing at 14nm, which was established 7 years ago.

It's been 2 hours since you placed the order!
Here's the English translation for the sentence: "Today, look at some weirdest news topics."
What is normal public opinion?
To randomly select three top-热 topics, you can choose: February 2nd, "Dragon rising"; increasing price of H&M; and the Carrefour incident. The sentiment spreads and forms peaks, then follows an指数下降 (Smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary舆情 is generated, a small峰 will appear again.
These seem to be similar to the "network sentiment evolution model" display on the Web Information Security Management Commission (WISC) official website.
What is an abnormal expression of public opinion?
randomly select six popular topics from the same event，呈现出 【孤峰状】、【锯齿状】、【断崖状】.
Here is the English translation for the given sentence:  "The shape of a独秀 (sui generis) is characterized by human overheating, quickly climbing to the top of the list of trending topics, attracting public attention. The shape of a 锯齿 (creeper) is characterized by periodic overheating, ensuring that the topic remains on the top of the list. The shape of a cliff is characterized by a collective撤离， after the trending topic has completed its function and received new tasks andnew battlefields."
In Figure 9, the peak of the interest in one event is exactly at the valley of another event, with no delay at all. It is certain that a unified group of marketers will receive the task and launch a new round of attacks.
The专业化 of black marketers is evident in the simultaneous listing of dozens of popular topics. Which topics attract attention, which ones provide informative content, which ones generate controversies, which ones转移视线， which ones influence perception, which ones mislead judgments, which ones煽动 emotions, and which ones manipulate decision-making. Black-market accounts are organized and operated in batches and key points, making it possible to consider almost all elements of舆情传播扩散.
Communication is a science, and regardless of subjective factors such as立场 and emotions，客观 data will reveal black marketing tactics.
The following is the English translation of the phrase "凡走过必留下痕迹":  "Where one travels, there is a trace left, and we will uncover this trace together."
The data source is: popular time machine.
"H.pylori infection cases among countries such as Malaysia have been found for the first time"
According to reports from external journalists of新华社， Mauritania, Cyprus and马拉维 have recently reported the first cases of COVID-19 variant Omicron strain infection.
"Mauritania reported its first two cases of infection with the Omicron strain on Monday."
According to the Ministry of Health of Marx Marx, one of the感染者 arrived inMauritania on November 27th and another one is a local resident ofMauritania who became positive for COVID-19 after interacting with a person who recently returned from南非.
After being isolated in a hospital, the positive核酸检测 results of the two infected individuals have been转为阴性， and they have now returned to their respective homes.
The塞浦路斯 Health Ministry announced on October 10th that it had first diagnosed three cases of Omicron variant infection in the country.
The three people are students who returned from abroad this月初. Since they are all mild, they did not require hospitalization for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government of the Singapore government has been emphasizing increased control measures.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers aged 12 or above who入境塞舌尔 by plane will have to pay for their own核酸检测 at the airport after arrival.
The Egyptian Ministry of Health also announced on October 10th that it will begin vaccination campaigns with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
The马拉维 Minister of Health, Qombe泽 Qo蓬达， on September 9 said that the country had discovered its first three cases of Omicron variant infection.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing on 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and discovered three infected cases.

I called and explained this to your staff.
Your骑手 told me that the address is too far.
"大美360集成家装"的英文翻译是 "Elegance 360 Integrate Home Building"。
The address: Room 12, Happy Home Building, No. 156，环南大道156号
"I started out with a friend's recommendation, because I trusted them, so I decided to check it out. At first, my budget was 7,000 for a basic renovation."
"Come to the store, and then start a series of scams."
I was only at the store for the first time and showed them my floor plan, but they did not measure the house. Then, they offered me a price for my 135-square-foot house and said that $7,000 would be enough. They just gave me a general look at their materials and didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is to pressure you into paying the advance fee only when you visit the store (and once you pay this money, you cannot return it, unless you have enough experience to engage in a legal argument with them).
When I was hesitated about whether to pay a deposit, they invited their so-called manager to come and tell you how much discount we can give you if you just pay the deposit today.
This is a big trap, and I am a鲜活 example of being被骗. I paid more than 10,000 yuan in advance, while my mind was easily swayed.
The quote he gave me has many issues. $7,000 does not include electrical and water changes, nor does it include any doors, cabinets, or bathroom walls. These three are the main components of the basic installation cost.
"After all these, their service centers charge higher fees than other companies."
I have lost trust in this company, and at the beginning, they wanted me to sign a contract without给我讲清楚 anything.
"When I went to get the refund, they showed a sense of experience, and there was a small team专门对付你."
"I will never compromise on the principle that it is the customer's problem and they are entirely at fault."
There are various excuses for blaming others, and there are many details to consider. I don't want to talk about it all again in tears. In any case, don't choose them because my friend's house they designed and decorated has poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the end.
"坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。"  A possible English translation for this phrase is: "It's a scam, they used to sell fake water feature decorations that were meant to欺骗 people, but now they've changed to something much bigger, and it seems like they've failed and are now trying to change again."
So everyone should avoid choosing such a corrupt home improvement company.
"以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。"  Translation: In the future, please make sure to search on Baidu before making any choices to check on these consultations, as updating the interior is not a small cost.

This is so terrifying. If you don't cancel your order by 30 minutes, please!
Is there not other way? For example, change the address?
Sure, then don't cancel the conversation. If the payment is not returned within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
"I asked if it was possible to cancel before 15 minutes had passed."

"星空有约"的英文翻译是 "The Starry約束"。
According to a statement by the Chinese National Bureau of Standards on December 12, 2023 (记者周润健), the双子座流星雨， one of the three major流星雨s in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th as the last major流星雨 of the year. Those who enjoy流星雨观测 can look for it in the late-night hours of that day.
"The English translation of the sentence is: An long-time天文爱好者 in Beijing，安久， captured the双子座流星雨 on December 13, 2018, in Qinghai."
The mother body of most流星雨 is a periodic彗星， but the mother body of the双子座流星雨 is 3200 Betelgeuse, which is a Apollo-type asteroid.
The双子座流星雨 is also the second known流星雨 that is not“孕育ed” by comets.
The sentence in English translation is:  "Xiusili鹏， an official from the Party Committee of Henan Province and an expert in天文科普， said that like a New Year's film, the双子座流星雨 usually occurs at the end of the year, and the‘release date’ can last from December 4th to 17th."
This流星雨 is known for its large and stable流量， and is together with the Orionid流星雨 and the Perseids流星雨， which are considered the three major流星雨 in the Northern Hemisphere.
The notable feature of the双子座流星雨 is its slow speed, rich colors, and many fire流星. It is suitable for目视 and初学者 in天文 photography.
The sentence in English翻译为：  "杨婧， a在天津蓟县天文学爱好者， captured the双子座流星雨 on December 13, 2020."
Astronomy predictions indicate that the双子座流星雨 of this year will occur around 15:00 on December 14, with the maximum intensity reached during the maximum period, which is a ZHR of 150 (the number of流星 that can be seen per hour under ideal观测 conditions, where the radiant point is above the head).
The recommended hourly score chart for the双子座流星雨.
Last year, the Double Star流星雨 left a profound impression on people, but this year, the Double Star流星雨 will be affected by moonlight, and the intensity will be reduced slightly.
The English translation for the given phrase is:  "On November 11th, with the moon in a full moon phase, the moon's bright light can interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the late night, and the rising point of the双子座流星雨 will also be higher at this time."
If you are friends who enjoy流星雨， you can observe them during the hours when the moon goes down after the late night. However, please be careful not to go out in cold weather.
How can we maximize the number of meteors we can观测？
"It is not recommended to perform observations in a city. You can choose a high elevation, low-light pollution, and open view from the suburbs or rural areas.耐心地等到月亮落下后，目测观测即可。"
It is worth noting that the流量 of the双子座流星雨 is large in all directions, and you don't need to look directly at the radiation point of the双子座流星雨 during observation.
If friends who enjoy photography want to capture stunning "流星雨大片", it is best to choose an wide-angle and wide- aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture during the shooting.
" Considering stability and durability, a tripod, spare battery, and shutter cable are also essential."
"Xingli鹏 emphasizes that."
What are the differences between laser television and traditional television in their market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV that you mentioned should refer to液晶显示屏. The differences in market positioning between液晶显示屏 and laser televisions are mainly two-fold:
"First, laser TVs are more focused on large screen markets."
Compared to the market positioning of flat screen TVs widely铺货ed, laser TVs seemingly have a more focused market, or perhaps laser TVs are本身就是一个的产物 for large-screen markets.
Currently, the mainstream screen sizes of flat screens are between 55 inches and 65 inches, while LED-大屏幕电视 sizes are usually over 75 inches, with the largest ones exceeding 100 inches. This fully meets the needs of users for large screen智能电视.
In recent years, laser televisions have been increasing in global出货量 and sales percentage, with a proportion of over sixty percentage in the overall sales of televisions with an above 80-inch screen size.
According to China Yiling康明斯的预测， in 2020, the market sales growth of laser television will surpass 140%，继续保持高速的增长。
The reason for the excellent performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser televisions in protecting the eyes.
Based on the成像 principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eye. Compared to the light emitted by the backlight of液晶显示器， the成像 process is more similar to the成像 process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The China Electronics Standardization Research Institute赛西实验室 and the Beijing General Hospital Eye Center's眼科 experts conducted a strict comparison试验 of laser TV and LCD screens under the same conditions among the population, resulting in a total of 144 test groups.
Data demonstrate that laser televisions indeed have strong眼睛保护 characteristics, and in certain aspects, they even have a certain improvement effect.
"At present, with视力健康 becoming increasingly important, laser television not only attracts more users due to its eye-friendly advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the television market."
Secondly，激光电视 are more concentrated in the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously declining price of液晶显示屏， the price of available laser televisions today is usually above $1000, with the price gradually increasing as the size and power of the display increase.
Why do laser televisions sell for such a high price?
The reason must be clear.
With the continuous development of lighting sources and technical levels, laser monitors offer many advantages that液晶 monitors and projection screens cannot achieve.
With its ultra- short focal length projection technology, laser televisions have a projection distance that is relatively short compared to traditional projection devices, allowing for a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. The主机 is compact and requires little space, making it a great option for small spaces.
In terms of brightness, major brand LED-LCD TVs can reach more than 2000流明.
Plus, its heat output is lower, allowing for less equipment wear and tear, and the TV has a longer lifespan.
In addition to this, many high-end laser television sets also feature true 4K ultra high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, providing users with a more impactful visual experience.
The English translation of this sentence is: "It is not a伪需求， but the result of需求细分. In terms of image quality and investment return on investment, laser televisions are not suitable for audio and video enthusiasts. If you want to combine large screen size and insufficient viewing conditions, you can try it, everything has both benefits and drawbacks, and it is better to weigh them before making your own判断. It is better not to rely on only one piece of information."
Simply put, ultra-widewide near-field投影仪--激光电视 have to use expensive ultra-widewide lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the optimal光学 design.
To block some of the external light, a micro-结构的 f涅尔幕布 is used, which is high in cost. The price of an 80-inch monitor is basically enough to replace it with a 65-inch液晶.
Another translation for the following sentence in English is: "Additionally, I particularly dislike when投影 manufacturers highlight the benefits of diffuse reflection for the eyes as a selling point. After all, the light that the screen can see for the eyes is considered direct light. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes will not see it. However, if you want to compare with液晶显示屏， they are also diffuse "direct light." Therefore, even when opening the TV, the ceiling will also be illuminated."
And, the projection screen if it's not a smooth reflection, it can't form a image.
The high gain screen布's heat spot (light spot) effect is恰恰忽略了， at a particular angle, a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes, which is really uncomfortable.

After adding WeChat for scheduling the date, the girl's mother sent me the available time schedule. The message was returned in a timely manner~
Before going, I checked the photography portfolio at the store. The majority of them were outdoor wedding photography, which were beautiful and there were many different shooting styles involved.
After arriving on the day, I briefly discussed my thoughts with the girl and she耐心地 helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was worried about. Finally, we decided to start makeup and造型. The photographer will set up some props and guide the action before taking the photo, and he will also pay close attention to details.
However, may be because we didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas, the resulting photos are not the style I am looking for, but they should be beautiful 🙊🙊
After the shooting, the photographer will help choose photos and communicate post-processing styles, which feels quite delicate.
The film needs to be repaired approximately for half a month, and we're waiting for the results~
The sentence in English translation is: "I won the second-ever photo session special meal event – all the clothes in the entire area can choose one to be selected for filming."
Finally, I chose a black silk dress to experience different styles.
The whole photography process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer who is responsible for it is a younger brother of a 95-year-old, and it feels a bit raw still. I hope he can give more suggestions in terms of customer movement guidance in the future! He is very talkative and the photography process was very enjoyable.
"文摄视觉美学摄影馆优选品质店"的英文翻译为 "Wen摄视觉美学摄影馆品质优先店"。
On the homepage, take a look at Queenie!
At the store, you need to fill in your name and phone number, then choose clothing. You can choose a wedding dress, and I have changed three or four sets of clothes. After you choose your clothes, makeup is applied for a long time, and the customer service is good. In the future, you will teach me how to pose for the pictures. It's said that the editing will take us about a半个月， but it arrived about three or four days ago, and it feels like there is no difference from the original picture.
The environment overall is good.
There are many clothes available.
The makeup positions about three, inside the studio is a camera棚。
The service is very热情 and detail-oriented.
The hairstylist is very patient.
摄影师 will also be very serious to teach you the movements.
If the client is not satisfied, the photographer will also主动提出 a follow-up session.
The experience may have been too drastic, as the original double-眼皮 was贴出了三层眼皮.
The eye brows also been cut, a little awkward for those who don't画eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photo was given for ten days, but the photo editing effect is not very satisfied. It feels that the eye mask still is very obvious.
Because it wasn't clear what style I wanted, I tried two sets of clothes. Ultimately, I chose the black dress, and the little sister said that this set was a bit of Hissigian vintage style.
Once you've selected your clothes, you can start on your makeup and hair. The makeup artist and the hairstylist are very patient and help me with the process, and the results are very satisfied.
After making up and styling, we started taking pictures. The photographer was in charge of me摆姿势 throughout the whole process, which was very easy and harmonious.
After completing the shoot, carefully chose four of the most favorite images to be fine-tuned. The young man said that the final output could be within 15 pages, and the outcome was very satisfactory.
There have been no responses for 3 days... due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the monthly charge plan #PRS_ORG# plus!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for every payment.
"I now need to pay the shipping fee every time."
Could you please allow me to cancel my subscription at your earliest convenience, and then charge me for it after you have completed your investigation?
"小雨伞买保险，靠得住吗？"
The Little雨伞 is an online insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of conditions set up: according to the " regulations on the supervision of insurance brokerage institutions (2015 revision)", to become an insurance brokerage company, it is necessary to meet three keywords: no major legal and regulatory violations in the last three years among shareholders and founders, a minimum limit of 1 billion yuan, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite harsh; in summary, they require strength, approval from the national regulatory body responsible for regulating insurance and banking within the country, good behavior from shareholders, and the Little雨伞 insurance company, as a insurance agency, doesn't need to worry too much about whether Little雨伞 insurance is legitimate. After all, there are these three requirements, which no insurance company can meet.
In this aspect, it is still quite good and reliable.
From the perspective of insurance products: Little雨伞 Insurance is like a insurance supermarket, where many companies' top-selling life insurance products are available on this platform, such as the latest addition, the Chinese market Super玛丽 5, where the Claim Center and the Underwriting Center are both China Life Insurance, and Little雨伞 Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, no need to doubt its credibility.
From the payment model perspective, Internet platforms' products generally have a higher value-added ratio than traditional retail platforms because they do not require the cost of operating store locations, labor salaries, and other expenses. In addition, the payment options are flexible and support monthly payments, which可以减轻 clients' payment pressure and enable insurance leverage at maximum levels.
"这点还是非常不错的"的英文翻译是：这点还是非常不错的。
"Considerable"
From the professionalism of salespeople, this is particularly important because insurance is a highly professional industry. Many internet products allow customers to self-schedule insurance policies, which can lead to many misconceptions. In terms of health information and job status, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective elements when enrolling in policies, thinking they are healthy or meet the requirements. This can pose many理赔 risks and increase the likelihood of rejection of claims.
I once worked as a保险 sales agent for " Tencent Tencent insurance" (like Goody Goody, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform) and I am very responsible to let everyone know about it.
The internet is true in terms of insurance, but it's not reliable. People are unreliable, and there are no professional从业人员 in the internet channels, which also leads to many sales frauds.
For example: A insurance policy that saves 600,000, a手机 gift, and a free 6-万 catastrophic insurance premium are marketing strategies that are 没错， but they are often回避重点， not telling the applicant that in the first month, there is a 1- dollar fee, and in the second month,normal charges apply, ranging from几十 to 200. Many customers pay for several years without realizing what they have purchased.
"以为可以花1块钱，保险公司赔600万(天下掉馅饼)。"  A possible English translation is: "We thought we could pay one dollar but the insurance company paid 6 million."
Here's the English translation for the given sentence:  "You will receive a free mobile phone, which is only given in special保单尾号段 such as 6666, 8888, and if the winning message is sent, no one will remind you to exchange it and you won't receive any notification."
(This is another trap for the client) You can get a free 60,000 Comprehensive Insurance coverage, but it's for a short period. If you only rely on this and have no other商业 insurance, if something happens to you, how will 60,000 help? It won't solve the problem and your future life will be裸奔.
Currently，误导 in Internet insurance sales is also being actively cultivated by the country.
Therefore, overall, the platform is not存在问题， and the products are also not存在问题. The problem lies in the professional level and操守 of the salesperson.
Please suggest that you carefully consider the whole situation. In fact, many offline insurance经纪公司 have a wider range of products, offering more opportunities and products for customers to choose from. Some of their products have better cost-performance than internet-based products.
"I have helped 59 internet clients, guarantees线下 products, and saved each of them 2,000-3,000 yuan/year in premiums."
If anyone has any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange knowledge with me.
I:My name is Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training. I have served over 900 corporate users and have collaborated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking a policy, I will take into account your customer's needs and customize insurance products for you. During the policy application process, I will compare three or four companies and strive to obtain the best核保结果 for you. After taking a policy, I will handle the paperwork and hold the policy in good standing, so you can have peace of mind and trust in our services.
"一起成长"的英语翻译是 " grow together"。
I hope my answer can be of help to you!
According to the insurance regulatory authority's definition, internet insurance is the insurance business in which the customer can complete all the insurance purchasing processes on their own after clicking on the insurance purchasing link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the applicant on their own.
Although online insurance covers may not have the " formality" of traditional coverage, and may even lack a printed paper copy of the contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal validity of the electronic version of the contract.
This这种模式 is somewhat similar to a mass-production line operation like "phone sales", but buying insurance also has a fatal problem -后续服务 may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that can last for decades. Should we really think carefully about whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" who will be with us for a long time, providing services to us after many years?

When discussing recent Meta (Facebook) falls 26% and its market capitalization蒸发 $2.51 trillion, Zuckerberg responded by saying, "We are facing an unprecedented level of competition." What are the reasons for this?
Meta (的原 Facebook) is实际上 a advertising company, with the main source of revenue coming from advertising. As of today, one of the most profitable advertising companies, Meta has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp，等等，无论什么样的功能定位，都是 Meta 的流量渠道。  这句话将 Facebook、Instagram、Whatsapp 等社交媒体平台比喻为 Meta(Facebook的子公司)的流量渠道，表示这些平台都被视为 Meta 的一部分，并且都拥有强大的流量导入能力。
Furthermore, Meta is also the largest "ad network", and many apps 外接 Meta's ads, enabling monetization through the Meta's ad platform.
However, times have changed.
"First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it becomes difficult for Meta to obtain users' data information, thereby affecting the efficiency of ad placement."
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it clearly prompts users whether they allow apps to access their personal information. The normal response for most people is definitely not allowed.
If Google makes another move next, the impact on the revenue of Meta will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in the growth of Meta's revenue has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is not certain and is unknown, but it is still present).
As everyone knows, Meta (Facebook) has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
"At least 10% of the revenue of Meta each year is contributed by China, mainly by companies in China's的海洋业务."
Meta's office in Hong Kong has about a hundreds of people, and there are also several major distributors in China.
If Chinese companies want to expand their海外市场， Meta is always the必经的广告渠道， and the money they spend largely goes to Meta.
It is interesting to note that TT is now one of the main competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta made a significant amount of money from字节.
The domestic agents all are helping ByteDance to invest in advertising on Meta, and the performance of Meta in the Chinese region in China is also excellent.
I haven't really dedicated myself to learning about it recently, but I don't think I'll be any better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies spending large amounts of money overseas was over.
"第三，新的流量渠道的拓展并不顺利。"
Facebook is getting older, and all new platforms, including TT, are not under Meta's control.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The资本市场 looks not only at income, but also at what is expected in the future.
很显然，Meta 的预期是不够的。
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg mentioned "Metaverse."
The metaverse确实 should be one of the directions of the future, but the implementation period of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be sufficient to支撑 the市值 of Meta in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be relatively difficult for Meta.
Although Facebook is currently very popular, it still earns between 10 and 20 trillion dollars a year. In fact, Facebook currently has a very strong sense of urgency, and compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies, there isn't any good internal barrier of defense.
Although some of his social media apps have higher daily active users and are also mainstream social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and others, Facebook doesn't have any confidence in its rapid development, and the颠覆 between them is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of creating a theoretical metaverse that is accessible but not feasible in a short period of time has no hope of success. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is the reason why Zuckerberg is constantly changing the name of his company and searching for new markets. However, I think his route choices are wrong and lead to a dead end.  This is my thinking and may be helpful for reference.
