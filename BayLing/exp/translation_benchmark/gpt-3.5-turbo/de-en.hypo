The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include with the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
A few days ago, I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to receive a credit?
I fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I do believe that it is good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Just take a quick look, help out for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough of a child themselves, I don't see a problem there.
If your child K1 is able to occupy themselves for a short period of time and is okay with it, then that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he has to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist made that statement.
Because if something were to actually happen, such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether or not this is a risk you want to take is naturally up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, the title just won't come to me, maybe someone here knows.
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by dousing himself with food and entering the enclosure of his big cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a short investigation, ends up with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the location of each suicide and document it, then post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, ultimately allowing them to confront their fears in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of the window, another intentionally drives herself to death.
Facing one's fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is the rough plot, and I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If someone is familiar with this action or even if someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I have to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail.
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) along the entire length.
They tried to pull it out with a pair of tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to do something.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

What am I supposed to do with this number then?
Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push forward booster vaccinations.
Always new Omicron cases are causing concern for politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, by New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the COVID booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers than previously planned.
"Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination," said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
"Johnson said that we are facing an emergency situation with the Omicron variant, which is why it is urgent to strengthen vaccination protection."
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Let yourselves be boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent.
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent an application.
Today the invitation for a conversation came via email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it's either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I also don't want to step on any civil servant's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them are leaving.
Only the one thing that I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an imperceptible defect at the time of sale.
How else could such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First attempted on the #PRS_ORG#.
That has been working for about.
Not anymore in 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books through the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and invoice me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently due to professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims do not seek help or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every situation... I know I can't.
It will never become easier that way.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How good is the series for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, stunning visuals: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, recently premiered on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said with a reference to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our bellies."
However, it did not subside after the game - but rather increased again in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby more than just the bare result, it was the manner of the performance that was disappointing.
As an example, a statistic can be mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: the three-point percentage was only 13 percent, with 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "After the victory in Tenerife, we simply weren't focused enough and didn't implement what we had trained for."
Namely to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "Winning a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed his team's game.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim.
While even the top performers in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and managed to come within eight points, after already trailing 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left for hesitation.
Already on Wednesday (7pm), the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators also allowed in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and therefore have written to them again.
We originally contacted them half a year ago.
Always perfectly groomed: Max Raabe turns 59.
He is able to thrill his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official orders" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned by him during the Advent season also have to be cancelled, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for the dates they had to postpone in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and enjoyed it as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is an indispensable figure in the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck." (dpa)
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to receive a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance?
It needs to be complemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but I can't flip through it.
Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created through expropriation.
The new Federal Minister of Building, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
"In an interview with the 'Tagesspiegel' (Sunday), Geywitz said, 'With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes'."
My goal is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations is, by the way, the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party will establish an expert commission to determine how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets, and an expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement it as quickly as possible.
"If the rental market does not relax nevertheless, "we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps", emphasized the SPD politician."
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I realized that I forgot the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available now.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
"Voucher sounds great."
Then I will redeem it independently with the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute impertinence.
At least 100 people dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept through the USA.
Alone in Kentucky, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
Several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the United States during the night of Friday to Saturday, possibly resulting in up to one hundred fatalities.
The storms leave a path of devastation approximately 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everything was gone wherever the tornado had swept through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He alone expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the display case #NAME# is sold out.
That is very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you report back?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item or submitted a return request through the contact form and wanted to inquire if it was received or being processed, as I have not received any confirmation yet.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash incentives for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into calls to get vaccinated - following the German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
He switched to a company about which he had gossiped.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
"Wait and drink tea."
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't get stuck in his old position and looked for something else.
You may do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, never mind.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take note of the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.
Good day - I am interested in the Boone dining table, white.

Help with first own campaign.
Greetings to Boron!
I am currently running the adventure "Over the Griffon Pass" for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
"The big picture is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out, and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter."
The premise is that the heroes should transport a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There, the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If not noticed, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow path and flank the wagon with bows, three on each side, while two armed with spears stop the wagon.
If there is a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes all become unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
If defeat is inevitable, this semi-elf and two of his servants will intervene and come to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you consider Deus ex Machina as a solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then send the return labels so that I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#?

Here, the lower part, which is essentially the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the starting accident, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision!
Apparently, it is the case that due to legal reasons, Formula 1 takes priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the entire race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher in F1, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this opportunity for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guessing game about what is now possible or required according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties regarding rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial commenting style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, even Heiko Wasser from RTL appeals to me more.
In addition, constant silliness comes into play, which makes both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter causes a lot of unrest in the comments, as he apparently does not take them seriously.
Last but not least, advertising is simply getting out of hand on Sky; in the post-race lap, Sky is the only channel that goes to commercials, as can be heard on F1TV where only the German audio track has to do without commentary immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
Also, these two channels have less advertising during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program on Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-language broadcaster that airs F1.
Unironically, except for the commercials, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the magnificent F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email, but she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12th, 2019.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I request support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifts.
This series is offered by us in 3 variations.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple diffusers.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model. However, fan pumps are also suitable for adding an accent to the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here, one could mention a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction, ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The air pump is connected to a diffuser or similar using an air hose of 4/6 mm...and then it can start.
The air pump should be at the same level as, or higher than, the water level and should be mounted externally.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from running backwards through the pump and out of the pool if it were to happen.
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we indicate a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, packages are packed daily and also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that nobody is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the logistics industry...of course, Corona doesn't stop here.
Please do not rate poorly right away just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
People naturally like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This also varies greatly regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order light-colored legs here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliantly blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amidst the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew as a NASA astronaut into space in 1961, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
"She just came along for the ride," said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed enthusiasm.
"The moderator said he would like to return to space again right away."
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to outer space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
This was already the third manned space trip by Blue Origin: In the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutch person.
In October's second flight, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was present, as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's deputy chief, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily select whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or play through its entire range of colors.
Set to color change, the luminous stone maintains a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp proves itself year-round outdoors.
In snowy surroundings, their light even looks particularly good - only a shortened lighting duration is to be expected as the days get shorter.
Please make sure in winter that no snow affects the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMH battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can purchase a suitable replacement battery for your decorative lamp through our webshop and thus further extend the usage time of your lamp.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting, and I don't mind being in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Before starting my studies, I naturally also informed myself about career prospects, but at that time I also thought that I definitely wanted to study until I got my doctorate.
At the moment, doubts are arising in me, especially concerning my career prospects, which are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (from Studycheck etc.), one often hears about great job opportunities and high demand for the profession, but on the other hand, one also hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/What training did you receive?
Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 to do an apprenticeship as a specialist in computer science.
If you have any experience with that, feel free to write about it :)
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends.
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why a post is only being added now.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas vacation, do we experience high levels of stress in our company.
As it seems, it is also available before holidays and bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week, a long 4-day weekend was coming up.
So what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
Lots of emails that absolutely had to be sent before the long weekend, one task after another, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the holiday.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like too much time has passed and that cannot be true?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-flagellation about holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we're not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress, it should be noted, did not come from above; all the colleagues were quite independent-minded.
My question is simple: Are only we Swiss like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you also know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"The actress and singer from Hit Radio FFH said, 'The beautiful thing is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest.'"
She will get into the festive spirit by baking cookies and crafting with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I have found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR handcrafted model of an old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and central Germany, this very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME magazine issue 11/1968, used with signs of play and missing parts as seen in the photos, functions well. The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for hauling heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working order.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlager drive from AEG, with the delivery of the mechanical parts from Siemens-Schuckertwerke and the electrical parts from AEG.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives took place, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and found themselves afterwards on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, the refurbishment worthiness of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the central German network progressed, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44, and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were given priority in construction.
Only when it became apparent that the number of E 94 locomotives that could be refurbished could not be increased any further, did the E 95 locomotives come into focus for refurbishment.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own schedule ahead of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
As they aged, the complicated controls on the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that the trigger got stuck during switching operations.
Then the assistant who constantly rode on this locomotive had to loosen the valves again during the journey with a hammer and wooden wedge.
Damage to the driving motors occurred frequently and led to months-long breakdowns of the locomotive.
As there were enough new locomotives available by the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the fragmented types, so the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, for them, the German Reichsbahn wanted to only have one person operating electric locomotives, which would have resulted in problems in train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, the E 95 01 followed as the last one, which retired on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at Halle main station as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time until the responsible persons at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle exhibition in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, she belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was carried out.
The locomotive is being preserved in a museum context at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P tradition community have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, while the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, function is good, optical touch-ups on the locomotive are necessary to be done by oneself, dusty, with signs of use, smells like a basement!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very limited edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held by two feet, unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I cannot assemble the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which unfortunately were produced with defects.
The center beam does not fit into the intended holder.
So I will receive new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off then?
No, not flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat with me.
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential building fire with two minor injuries and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, as the police reported on Sunday, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect intentional arson.
The criminal investigation department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
She arrives much later then.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo.
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
Şahin stated that the illness of a friend had motivated him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information in social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the "LinkedIn" network on Friday.
"For several months, my friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
"Şahin continued to write that the school friend and his family are not vaccinated."
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Anxiety is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
There is an interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as clarified by Deutsche Welle itself.
"Currently, it is not legally allowed for me to obtain the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the administration of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, prioritization has long been lifted - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power.
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases, probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, on Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility company Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected individuals for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
"We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
"He explained that the repair of the damages will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily restore some of the lines to operation."
According to company statements, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 pm severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm.
Since 11:15 pm, even those who were still affected by the outage have had power.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After setting up emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire stations if help is needed," said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
Furthermore, according to authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who require electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I cannot mount the base on the tabletop.
It is about custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot slide them together and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me further with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back because it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combined Skier Riiber Wins.
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to concede defeat to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be included.
As soon as I try to open it, the message "oops!" appears.
This document could not be opened.
Report to customer service that the file may be faulty.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone, now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure an even and clean application of paint, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry them off.
Before you apply a new color to the model with the brush for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the inside of the components that will no longer be visible later or on a yogurt container.
The first line on the component.
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
A slight overlap of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick back and forth brushing with the brush.
This creates surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might otherwise shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are applied at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before assembling them.
The models achieve an authentic appearance through the use of decals or stickers.
From national emblems on airplanes to ship names, to decorative strips and emblems on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An airplane cockpit can be more easily stickered before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks when gluing are time, patience, and a steady hand.
Cut each required decal individually and arrange them for yourself.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten their back with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then you only push the picture a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check first if the image is properly positioned before pushing it completely off the paper, so that it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only briefly open a book, as soon as I look at something else, I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and look for the place where I stopped reading.
On Saturday, I already communicated with you once.
Can I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in three separate packages at my place.
Ok, nevertheless, thank you very much!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is refunded.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance event"?
Hello everyone,
We were undergoing fertility treatment for some time, but now that it comes to billing with the private health insurance, they suddenly refuse to pay.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and underwent 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet settle the bill with the private health insurance.
We applied again for cost coverage from the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive ones to the private health insurance), we submitted the bills to the private health insurance and received the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first offer expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance event begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have informed us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you in advance for your help!
Can you please send me the three options by email and let me know how I can reach them again?
Okay.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They are welcome to pass it on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been arranged and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't be blamed for the fact that the dresser arrives completely disturbed at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It is clear and evident that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received any repayment through #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the wardrobe and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with stools that can be purchased additionally, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films.
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what a low-budget film exactly is.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture that is made with very little or no financial support from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you perhaps not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it now reliable?
Thank you.
With kind regards.
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
"The costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania," Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd)."
"The researcher from the Berlin-based Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) stated that the EU did not solve the confrontation sustainably."
This state of uncertainty - Belarus is not giving up entirely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not decisively oppose it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
"She apparently cannot assert herself when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to its border."
Furthermore, according to Bossong, the EU pays an additional price for its policy at the border with Belarus: a fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the "border protection, border protection, border protection" line has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border.
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
"A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested and returned to the border during the night on Sunday."
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
Overall, border control registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed off sections of their border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures from there.
Bossong said that the most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on airlines.
There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough measures and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' perspective, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch car in front of him had overtaken.
I am checking that.
I am speaking with the bank and will contact you again.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is hosting SC Freiburg Fan Day.
The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone in red and white through the jerseys on that day.
"The park stated that Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop."
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of the original price of €1699?

At 21 years old, he leaves Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
Verstappen celebrates his first World Championship title at the Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi at the age of 24 - with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final lap.
Back then, I already had a huge problem with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord," author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also served as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and sensitively listens to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
Yesterday, I submitted the contact form for returning an item, but did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your stupid chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you need to fix and not everyone from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I cannot chat with them every day.
Yesterday, we chatted and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
With kind regards.

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
This is like when an AfD supporter says they have nothing against foreigners.
Both of them will not admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should simply completely refrain from doing so.
Well then, you're just as untrustworthy as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, a God set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just talking nonsense.
"And thus, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously any further, like Kollegah."
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and color errors up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to actual usage conditions.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to pay attention to the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When the optimal usage conditions are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
You can find further instructions in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already contacted you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called something else before.

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women in the municipality of Krembz choose the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations while selling fir trees.
Once a man is said to have driven home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
He plants around 2000 pieces for it every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun.
And what about the voucher?
Otherwise, I'll be gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both therefore have their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "turner," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic.
We have had a new fiber optic connection in our house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am having problems setting up a stable wifi network now.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few outages.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and they also arrive at the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan module that sends out the WiFi, not the full 500 arrive anymore, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less arrives (so if I use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was indeed slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" with fiber optic through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely costly to still lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch your checking account.
Whoever thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks from their customers, the exemption thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the tax-free allowance and even quadrupled it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower tax-free allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular among cost-conscious customers, has lowered the exemption limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a tax-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, who have even been granted the right in the first instance by the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now there are already discussions in the banks about whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates fundamentally inadmissible and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen as the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip per day (yes, you read that right: only ONE chip from the bag).
That both female and male fans equally adore you is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still searching for the great love.
And has crossed off the desire for a baby from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up.
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight collision with the barriers, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before even completing half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the top tier of motorsport.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and reached the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sports.
The goal of the bobsledder is the brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes.
"I've calculated it, I would need to achieve nine and a half wins per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who secured two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he defended against Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, by moving from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he achieved a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also secured his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who drives for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously finishing in second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after coming in fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
"Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka."
Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track among the women.
After only reaching fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to victory in the World Cup on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi during the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She achieved her first podium finish of the winter season in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
"For me it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me."
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized, "It's not just about pushing, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the rides that were not completely error-free, but said: "We're heading in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I did not receive it just now and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently on sale :)
Why will the shipping only start on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it, an additional field with the message appears.
Was taken over by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only one more day, only one more week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and ladies and women,
"I have some things that I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for one or the other..."
I am 24, have C-PTSD, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also suffering from a cold and we currently see each other less (1-2 times a week), which is causing me a lot of distress with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is currently experiencing stomach ache, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket, feeling a bit more relaxed after I used a heat lamp and petted him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now we also have housework coming our way, which we will of course divide among ourselves.
But even cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well managed, I am reasonably well treated and coping.
Not good, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only two more days, then it's the weekend.
But then it continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues endlessly.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I cannot put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my PTSD otherwise.
"I believe that this has partly to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here."
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
Today I received my order, unfortunately it is a completely different color and the surface is scratched, and there is a mark on the table leg.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th.
Furthermore, twice.
However, she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: Back then in school, I realized that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them, it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, that was always something strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and so I always somehow believed.
What is your opinion on this?
Perhaps you can also talk about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I prefer to write in English as I understand it well.
That's already been a long time, then I would refrain from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response promptly, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support, #NAME#.
Film search help please.
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
Since I cannot describe it any closer anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot develops.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into that realm in order to be able to live himself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other, I believe.
If that means something to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on their stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything around is right, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child while they sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the belly?
Or is it face down directly in the mattress?
You can deduce from that whether everything is okay.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already a "regular customer" of yours and have already purchased many items.
But why are you only offering me 20EUR then?
Hello, I already spoke with a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback so far.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV as well.
But it's just that the politics of this channel have become absolutely terrible.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also going on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a walking billboard."
What are you now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising channel that tries to sell its cheap merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we also have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
This naturally applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make a profit at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that exploded.
How are you supposed to like all of this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I request a call back because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or just for cuddling - my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry stone pillow with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odors, mold or burn marks and dispose of it immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking it!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but it disappears with repeated use.
Be sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the warmed inner cushion has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in cases of acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises, open wounds, or in people with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and keep them inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is located.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt finishes second in the first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the German football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well even under the third coach.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful start under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the power supply alone would be sufficient for operation.
No display, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even though the power cord is plugged in.
Afterwards, I removed the battery, but still nothing happens.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop while it's plugged in?
Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
A 20-liter capacity can easily accommodate larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior, they remain well organized and separated from the photography equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design is proverbially impressive - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: Firstly, conventionally through the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, securely riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
The clasp and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the top flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the practicality of the backpack: if you not only carry your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior space individually (more on that below) and thus store both separately without any problems - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack across your body from the right side to access, for example, the camera equipment in the main compartment on the right, while keeping everyday items safe in the left half of the backpack and preventing them from getting in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.
Translation: #NAME# sent me an email yesterday as confirmation for the commissioning.
The shipping company has announced contact to arrange the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support employee, and with none of them did I get further than a promise that I would receive an email confirmation.
This concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help.
Wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment were made on January 12th, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And I couldn't have known that the past year would turn out differently than expected, and therefore I wasn't able to resolve and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept it like this.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All customized panes are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain panes and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that focuses on balancing the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is seeking wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build enterprises.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly "works" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California achieved official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a barrier!
This deactivates half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the announcer rotates to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I choose the shipping method "Warensendung" (games wrapped) for dimensions up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, usually insured with DPD and with shipment tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped in fleece and packing paper).
If you are a collector, then for an additional fee of 2 euros, I can also ship cardboard inside the box to ensure that there are no pressure marks.
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD media library.
CW psychological abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of power.
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other responsible individuals should never, never, never prioritize power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States discuss the elimination of testing requirements for triple-vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide elimination of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
"The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on this matter already next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back.
What is the best way for me to proceed there?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer works.
I have updated my account information.
What could be the reason for this?
What you are describing is called *awareness*, which refers to sensory perceptions during general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less commonly in seeing images, and very rarely in perceiving pain.
Relevant for this topic: Cesarean sections are surgeries that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, however, u/Nitemarex did not have it by definition.
I read your comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, even the 20€ won't help us.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is not only a legal obligation but also a standard in the eCommerce industry.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
That way we also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They informed me that they only deliver to the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor for me.
Won't I be called then?
I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older."
The poignant diary of a slow farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for my life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common ones are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was just over 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I received many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and tender!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will make a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, only a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good as it used to be, but I can manage.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been processed.
But until today, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
Have you not yet bought any poultry?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier significantly contributes to the warmth and richness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "Gain" and distortion.
As mentioned earlier, with the POWER LEVEL controller, you can even quickly create a power reserve if things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
This signal, which is connected here, is processed with a speaker simulation so that even when using headphones or recording directly, you get an extremely "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
Those who additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently access the sounds, turn the effect blocks on and off, and "tap" the tempo of compatible effects with their foot.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it with others before.
Is there a possibility for you to send the lamp back?
Is it hanging too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on the nuclear agreement.
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiations are attended by negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have a coronavirus incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day incidence rate as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had consistently had the highest incidence rate nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence rate in Thuringia had slightly decreased but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals with intensive care.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery only takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out, stick it on the package, and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I not have to click/provide/fill in anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return shipment at my own expense, please.
8 euro return fee is outrageous in my opinion.
It is time for changes.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post here?
If you take a look at the activity of the German Bundestag in the past months, you can come to one conclusion: It is non-existent.
We have entered a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason for it?
For the most part, this is likely due to dissatisfaction with how certain things have gone here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has increasingly shown that many here still really want to be part of the Bundestag.
What we need to change.
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is called upon, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found, to put it simply, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server for this purpose, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure that I've forgotten some things, but that's not a problem, because we have Discord in the end.
If you feel like it and have time, come to Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you for this purpose, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for that.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I receive a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in an oversized version, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for pickup - you need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for the assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide on the return?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought.
Namely, that I long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but eventually reflected and understood that ultimately I also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was discontent on her side. She then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduces animal suffering.
Now I am wondering if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you quickly get pigeonholed and conflicts arise, without intentionally provoking them.
A harmony-loving vegan greets you (;
This is clearly not an exception according to § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# collects my return.
Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately, it cannot be changed either.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From February 1st, #NUMBER#, I will be consistently available again.
"Lahnsteiner rescue team equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros in subsidies from the state."
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to the Lord Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one can expect a permanent increase in operations: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle rivers, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I followed your recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did NOT work.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole thing has already cost me a lot of time and now I am hoping for help.
Okay, then it is so.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a delivery date during the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were determined in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thank you first of all for facing this whole situation here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, meaning we were also carrying weapons in law enforcement, but I don't want to go into further detail on that!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
In principle, it should be said that of course the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people in uniform and carrying weapons naturally attract those who are right of conservative, but it is also clear that these people may have difficulty dealing with reality. This is because, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine gay stereotype, as there are few to none of these in law enforcement, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't know were gay unless they told you). I can and must rely on these people, because in a crisis they will save your life or put their own on the line for you.
But even these marginalized groups, even if it sounds strange at first, in my experience, hold a conservative attitude, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less represented by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly advocates for them or tries to please them, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wing individuals there, but it is completely exaggerated and also annoys me that they are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly hatch plans that endanger the state.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad begin to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that certain right-wing like-minded people meet and engage in lively exchanges of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well fought against and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply intertwined internationally, and in my opinion, that's a good thing because we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It's still about my order that is no longer available for delivery.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket in black could be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# euros, or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part, there are two deep notches that were filled with something yellow.
And there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
More organized because of a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been preoccupied with something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed and have very little free time), but all my life I have struggled to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases where everything piles up, and every now and then it grabs me and I clean up and tidy.
But it's actually never like "someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not any better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we enjoy cooking.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me, I don't have any motivation, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no one comes to visit and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide greater motivation or do you remain careless?
I am looking forward to your responses.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, as well as anatomically pre-formed cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit, and thus allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, extended embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (during arm and knee bends).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and crotch ensure a snug, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thereby improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and donning equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility during arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head hood).
Soft zone located in the collar improves sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle Velcro closure that does not adhere to the lamination or seams.
Double cuffs with zippers at the wrists and ankles connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood.
Langer G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels are flush bonded with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs are hemmed for greater durability.
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I completed a training in software development and have been fully trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I think that has improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't really want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
However, I don't know if the actual work routine is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find information about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it's difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping them from their work with my stupid questions"/"they must think I'm intellectually challenged" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was also no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup.
What do you mean by "return please!"?
When I have downloaded a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS_ORG# is not authorized to read this book" appears.
Are there any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG# and he asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these it builds up its own protein substances, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the regeneration of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
After this course of NEKTON-Bio, it should be switched back to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One leveled measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, at the beginning, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the start of feather regrowth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the regrowth of feathers is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community employee in contradiction to the bylaws.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a request for a trap has been submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut tree is explicitly listed as a tree to be protected in the statute.
Can I rely on the employee's statement now or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clearly defined.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without any use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher then?
What was more expensive then?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident in Selb.
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
As the police press alert currently reports (2:03 pm), a car has crossed into oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand.
Good, then thank you very much again for it being so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career development.
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here... in short, I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing my teaching qualification as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to at least remain somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
However, the whole thing was too boring for me, so I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now reached the third "I'm googling other job postings" stage.
And it's only been half a year.
In the previous instances, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, then I can still change direction afterwards.
But right now, I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation time, but there's still a ton of work waiting for me.
Before the internship, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekends were still my weekends and my evenings were still my evenings.
I had a day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from an external perspective, the Ref is also running well in terms of feedback and such.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it's not already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have it like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to my old field where I was appreciated, could take free time when I needed it, and although I found the work somehow boring, I was paid appropriately and worked together in a team instead of being a lone fighter like most of the time now.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I will have arrived at the same place as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You can tell that everything is somehow confused, but perhaps as outsiders you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I won't make decisions emotionally right now, that will probably lead to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for my whiny tone.
I hope that my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series by VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances bubble forth.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined multiple times to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier, and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuitry of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts perfectly to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and lenses.
One possible equipment setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash attachment.
Larger mirrorless cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Furthermore, you can also store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who has a small mirrorless camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for their equipment and non-photography related items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history.
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, lasting 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists still did not dare to make a prediction of when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions.
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava, which is over 1000 degrees hot, has destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Two new peninsulas with a total size of approximately 50 hectares were formed off the coast through cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly depend, was particularly affected and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
The newspaper "El País" wrote that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas were severely affected.
Christmas and the gifts.
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something alluring about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss has been a peace-making "social contract of primitive societies", can escape rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas holidays with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as the Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to spare them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular German tradition emerged of filling boots, especially those of children, with presents.
Protestants objected to this tradition because they reject the veneration of saints as intermediaries between God and humans.
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther turned Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby established a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve as a result.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as so strict, it only annoys a few that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas tradition with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still a fixed part of the Advent season.
Today, one can find everything one's heart desires in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources indicate a tradition of gift-giving on the day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a cheerful confusion about who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the specific region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is basically a type of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure during the Christmas holiday.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.
For the past 3 weeks, I have been receiving this error message when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact information are up to date.
nicht weiß, was ich tun soll.  Please help me with troubleshooting, as I don't know what to do.
Otherwise, buy a different e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that one will be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not even in the spam folder), I wanted to inquire now how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Police shoot alleged bank robber near the royal palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your website.
The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The light is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar panel for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum lighting duration of 10 hours.
The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: Only the sun ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a power supply nor batteries.
Place the "glowstone" in any location that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes provide a secure hold if necessary.
The matte white plastic casing itself is sturdy and weather-resistant.
Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; you can choose the color yourself: you have six attractive light colors to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
The shutdown also happens automatically once the battery level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or when it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done that several times, it doesn't work.

During lockdown, no hardware store is open anyway.
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super quiet operation, especially for bell armature motors - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load control can now be adjusted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for the automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder provides enough power with up to 1.5A motor current, even for older motors.

Pill problem.
Hello dear women.
I hope I'm doing everything right here, as this is actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stop doing that again because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last approximately two-year break, I explosively got pimples from 0 to 100 and they were all over the place.
So far, so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, everything never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this happening again.
My cosmetics are already free of perfume and unnecessary additives, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist unfortunately did not take me seriously and I still have to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Well, dear skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis in adolescence, then a period of calm, followed by widespread lichen planus and acne issues.
Regarding my chronic illness, I have tried everything possible in terms of nutrition and have ended up sticking to a diet that is low in sugar, milk, and meat because nothing else has worked quite as well.
It could also be that hormonally things are just not going well, but when you have problems everywhere like me, you just don't want to go looking for what else is going wrong.
I had already given everything to her colleague Semina or similar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was responded to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check? If the money were there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but is it generally available in large size?
since he is available in black and large

In the name of the people: laypeople make judgments.
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothes.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear robes: lay judges, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't access my customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order number #NUMBER# again to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means to store them for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.
"Previously, I had ordered and received the same blue chair in November. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I would like to order one in gray now."
Does the wardrobe have to be completely dismantled for collection and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
A 110-kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022.
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is set to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality with the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the town of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only partially arrived with us so far.
The blue order number:#PRS_ORG# with tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are now?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget about that, I already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass dresser and all the sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry was made at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues.
I have been in teacher training since summer and I enjoy teaching, but currently I have big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped technologically, so basically I can only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
In school, I can only make black and white copies for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I simply need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour is actually different.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time even for simple lessons (I also need that time for exercises, etc.).
I always start with the learning objective when planning, and then I think about how I can structure it. Usually, I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have.
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore, also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible for now.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation affecting the Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed in.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains about a decline in sales.
He also has a possible solution at the ready.
According to the German Retail Federation (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized that there have been declines in sales in businesses that sell non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook for the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Accordingly, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only runs well in the food retail sector and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
"The shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter," said the CEO.
"He emphasized that 2G (vaccinated and recovered individuals only) while shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic."
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel effort.
"He demanded that the regulation of wristbands be allowed nationwide."
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the wristband received.
In addition, spot checks should be sufficient in retail, as already implemented in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate corporation Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently at around 75 percent of pre-corona levels without 2G, while revenues were at approximately 90 percent.
"These figures will now certainly fall in the midst of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center once and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed."
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame that was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very high-quality light output with soft light, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the light, there is a control panel consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of each setting on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, which arises from the possibility of operating with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power before the set - it has a built-in battery tester - a value is displayed for each of the two battery compartments on the two display screens (the left battery on the upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, which allows you to attach it directly to your camera tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted on both sides by means of locks.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and therefore designed for durability and tough use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included in the delivery.
Great is that a bag is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories that you may still want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party that we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen team, who had previously been winless in two consecutive games, seemed to be on their way to another Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it on, shooting out their frustration over a mediocre season start within a good hour and triumphantly winning 5:2. "It's madness what the guys achieved today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and gave a "general praise to everyone who was involved."
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still standing in ninth place and falling short of their expectations.
Patrik Schick had brought Leverkusen into a 2-0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"As the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly strong," said the 27-year-old, and he was particularly pleased with the result for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in top physical condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professional.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and complete the tasks at this level until the turn of the year.
Next up, as part of the English week, there is an away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (6:30 pm, Sky) on the schedule.
I received an email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
For me, this would unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for women's handball team before quarterfinals against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with their heads down and empty stares after being humiliated by Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the German national team suffered a bitter defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"Bundestrainer Henk Groener judged that we were far too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent."
We have to approach Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game for all of us that we need to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a spot in the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German scorer in the duel against the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We simply weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We need to quickly look forward now."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at their best from the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in attack, as well as gaps in defense, were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the hoped-for spark of inspiration.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impact - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke also received a red card shortly after for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection play somewhat better and at least reduced the deficit to five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the break was gone after only seven minutes with the score at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for a medal in the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

Please send me any transaction number or anything else that could help.
"Transfer confirmation..." etc.
I would like to give away a voucher code.
Just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers.
Is that possible for you?
The title dictates that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
As these will soon be largely finished, part of it will then continue for me in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (for example, "I am taking medication X, does it interact with the vaccine?").
My responsibilities include providing information about vaccination, determining whether a person is eligible for vaccination according to the COVID-19 vaccination regulation and has no contraindications, documenting medical information, and potentially providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have any doctors with us, but "only" (without any lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are not able to administer vaccinations (are not allowed to?), so I end up administering most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
What exactly is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, submitted by someone from Amberg, has caused intense reflection on the "Wir in Bayern" TV show.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the "Guess who?" segment remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And also nobody who needs everything to go quickly.
The people heard from the TV moderator that this was completely wrong.
On what the man from Amberg revealed the solution, which probably also surprised many people from the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag used to clean the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With this, a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have turned off/on the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the computer, synchronized it, and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for road bikes - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little bit to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice - but then happened what lurks in almost every city center (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, there was a loud hissing sound and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the way.
As I didn't have a real opportunity to get a spare coat and spare tube due to the weekday, I had to turn back with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
Mood-wise, it wasn't that bad either, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now I am faced with a question and I hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would extremely dislike getting this problem repeatedly.
Now it really wasn't bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who drove 120km until 2pm on the day I picked up the bike!) were also suboptimal, as he had already called them, having ridden them on a roller for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90kms, I think I'll be really grumpy :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the train station who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire right now, only to end up disappointed anyway.
Furthermore, I wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike, I believe.
They apparently also exist in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skids into tree: driver fatally injured.
The 53-year-old had crashed his car into a central reservation for unknown reasons while driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, and subsequently veered onto the opposite lane, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old driver and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Yes, we have. We have deleted all books, authorized everything anew, and loaded new books.

After the release of our new high-end full-range driver B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also have new additions.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually resembles the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction plan includes a suitably designed stand to elevate the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited for individuals for whom maximum volume plays a subordinate role, but for whom an exceptionally high level of sound quality is desired, due to its principle.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she behaves remarkably mature and is extremely impressive and precise for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in high tones.
This is generally common with broadband to optimize the strong increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise in the optimal stereo triangle.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a dynamic range that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is recommended to consider the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan for any necessary changes during construction.
If, for example, one wants to veneer the housing, the recess of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the panels have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor panel at the corresponding location, so that the cable can be easily passed through later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front is now being created so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be flush-mounted.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the "Detail Chamfer" image.
Afterwards, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of oneself.
Now the back wall, lid, front, and bottom are glued onto it.
In addition, the three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if, for example, one wants to use finished strips from the hardware store instead of making them oneself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step of work, the second side will be attached.
After that, all parts of the foot follow, so both sides as well as the front.
By using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit, the installation of the openings for the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the back wall is facilitated.
Subsequently, a round cutter is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next is the marking and pre-drilling (with a 2.5mm drill bit) of the screw points for the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of sawdust (vacuumed/blown out), one begins with laying the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back panel.
In doing so, the entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot up to the terminal opening and left protruding approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, lead the cable to the speaker opening and also let it hang loosely there.
Below, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The construction plan of the frequency divider, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions for the Solo 15 crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, one can drip hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and securely fastened with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which has required more planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be present via switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
It will start around 12:30 am.
Get drinks ready, plan good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
