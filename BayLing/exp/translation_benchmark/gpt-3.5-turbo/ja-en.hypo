The price of the orange one is more than double.
What is different, I wonder?
I couldn't figure it out even after researching, so please tell me.
There should only be blue available now.
If there is any, it may only be that there are remaining old products.

"I don't feel like watching TV anymore because there's stuff like that."
Does that mean becoming a comedian is becoming impossible? TV is full of comedians.
Yesterday, I watched "Iroha Chidori" on Netflix, but there were many scenes where the staff laughed out loud behind the scenes, even when nothing particularly funny was being said.
Even though it's clearly not funny, the creepy flattery laughter of "I have to laugh at everything they say because they're a popular comedian" is just so unsettling.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it might ruin the comedian's mood and be bad for work relationships.
That industry seems very much like a former black company, with a strong sports team-like atmosphere, and some entertainers have such big egos that they take unpleasant attitudes, but I guess they have to do that to survive.
On the other hand, there are many instances where comedians themselves exaggerate the difficulty of their work and constantly argue "don't underestimate comedians".
I know that the income is quite low until I become popular, but even if people keep saying that being a comedian is one of the toughest jobs, it doesn't really help.
It sounds like a justification for the glorification of one's own career and the excessively high status of comedians in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough aspects in the industry I work in, but I feel like things related to the world of comedy are becoming increasingly difficult to handle.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

The product I ordered from Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that had become cheaper, but the wired version of the mouse arrived and I was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
Rather than a discussion about building a PC, it's about an online shopping problem. But I can't understand it at all, and since it's a well-known place, I'll write about it here.
The trigger was discovering that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was being sold for 3,280 yen (link to archived page) during the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale that started last Friday.
At the store, the wired version was priced the same, so I checked the page for the wired version, considering the possibility of a pricing mistake, and found it to be 5,071 yen (link to archive). Therefore, I considered the possibility that it was not a mistake and placed an order.
The order email arrived normally and the shipping email arrived the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in both of these emails and in the purchase history on my page.
At the time, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive because there was no mistake notification or cancellation notice from the order to the shipment.
The problem starts from here, and a few hours after shipping, an email came saying "there was a mistake in registering the product."
According to that email,
They were selling the wireless version at a sale price, but in reality it was the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
1. Refuse to accept and cancel the entire order.
Return only the mouse and receive a refund.
3. Use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose the response.
Although the product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separate, and both the purchase history, email, and invoice indicate that the product is the wireless version, it seems that they sent the wired version without permission.
Isn't it terrible that they send something different from the product I bought without my consent and then tell me to send it back if I want a refund?
"Whether I ultimately accept a refund or not, please lend me your wisdom because I want to make a counterattack."
If you were looking for a spouse or partner, would you not want to date someone who has a bad relationship with their family?
Or is it unrelated?
If you mind, why is that?
For example, people who have cut ties with their parents or siblings.
I don't really mind.
The reason for bad relationships can be due to various personalities or unreasonable people, whether they are parents or siblings.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the district was washed away by a typhoon and heavy rain, and residents tripled their emergency food supplies. (From Fukushima TV on Yahoo! News)
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from Takaharabaru district in Yabuki town, Fukushima prefecture.
The 2019 Typhoon in Eastern Japan had a significant impact on the living of 3 households and 8 people.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, it's like 'Is this for real?'"
"I had a feeling like, 'Will it break so easily? Will it be washed away?' The only road connecting to the Takachihara district, the 'Takachihara Bridge,' was washed away by the Typhoon in Eastern Japan, leaving 11 households and 30 residents in the district isolated."
Residents who were forced to endure water shortages continued to transport necessary supplies using the JR railway bridge, which is normally not allowed for pedestrian use.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto said, "Normally, cars can come up to the garden, but over there, we had to get out of the car and carry or put it on our backs to walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt the value of transportation and cars." The temporary bridge that was completed a month later was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and the area was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and while recovery efforts have progressed, Mr. Matsumoto continues to implement measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases."
"For now, I thought I'd like to secure at least 2-3 days' worth of supplies." I prepared about three times as much emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Mizuko Matsumoto said, "It's not someone else's problem, we never know when a disaster will strike us, so I strongly feel that everyone should have some emergency supplies." Meanwhile, Yaimai Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" where bridges were washed away.
To not forget the lesson, we started our own town initiative from 2021.
Yamatsuri-cho Education Department, Chief Takahashi Ryuichi: "We have designated October 12th as 'Yamatsuri-cho Disaster Prevention Day' and announced that we want to continue to make it a day to consider preparations for disaster prevention in the future."
"I think awareness has increased about the possibility of unexpected events happening more than ever before."

However, as far as I remember from Hiro YukI's video, he said that if parents and bad people go to the organization that provides clothing, food, and shelter, and are told not to come, they will still go and the organization will somehow help them (vaguely remembered), so there may be such organizations.
"Experience the Paramarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News"
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo held an event where participants could run a digitally recreated marathon course of the Paralympics.
This event was created to allow people to experience the new excitement of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
At the venue, running machines and road bikes were prepared, and visitors to the venue were sprinting on a virtual Paralympic marathon course reproduced in a virtual space while wearing dedicated equipment.
On each tablet where a virtual space is projected, one's own avatar appears, and a mechanism has been created where one can experience running a marathon course while competing with participants from both Japan and abroad, and furthermore, one can also enjoy sightseeing spots in Tokyo.
The participants said, "The scenery changed dramatically and it was really enjoyable."
"While running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's tough while running, but being able to enjoy it while running is incredibly fun, and I'm glad I was able to do my best while competing with everyone until the end." The city official said, "In the future, we want people to be able to enjoy it even at sports gyms, so we hope to install it as early as the beginning of next year."

What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The newly established "building condition survey" system aimed at revitalizing the second-hand housing market has led to a thriving second-hand housing transaction.
Both detached houses and apartments have seen an increase in prices, and the renovation market is also expanding.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, while the desire for owning a home has increased, there has been a concentration of popularity towards properties represented by words such as "station-front, station-near, station-directly connected," "large-scale," and "tower," which have become increasingly expensive, and this has also been influenced by the sharp decrease in relatively inexpensive newly-built properties.
"View the images in this article. However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan remains at a very low level."
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Real Estate Transaction Law and started a building condition survey called "inspection" aimed at ensuring safe and secure transactions of second-hand houses. (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf)
This is a system where an architect knowledgeable in housing inspects the current condition and overall state of the property, including any deterioration, and compiles a report to present to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections benefits both buyers and sellers.
The seller conducts a property investigation before the sale and purchase transaction to avoid claims after delivery and provide a sense of security to the buyer.
This ultimately leads to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, it is argued that the system is highly beneficial as it allows buyers to understand the condition of the second-hand house they plan to purchase and make a satisfactory purchase.
However, under the current system, the main responsibility for conducting a building condition survey lies with the seller.
In addition, it is important to note that only the notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent responsible for intermediation has the obligation to explain whether they can or cannot introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey during property intermediation, but the actual implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the one hand, there are concerns about risks in inspections led by the seller, but on the other hand, in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom where the second-hand market is thriving, similar systems have already been established.
In the preliminary stage of residential real estate transactions, there is a system where the buyer requests a building inspection from a specialist called an "inspector" or "building surveyor".
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home transactions.
The nature of the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly focused on the seller, is significantly different from the point that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection.
The seller tries to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and sell it as quickly and for as high a price as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer side carefully examines the investigation contents and intends to carry out appropriate repairs in order to live with peace of mind.
Even if it's the same inspection, there is a discrepancy in the purposes and intentions of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as concerns and risks regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection, which is seller-led and established by the country, remains minimal.
As it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking truly important defects. For inspection companies, intermediary companies (sellers) who introduce them to projects can be considered as customers.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections may be conducted with "consideration" such as not reporting investigation results that are unfavorable to the seller.

It was quite tough.
However, mentally I had recovered, so I was full of motivation.
Even though I had a research job, my body couldn't keep up and I would fall asleep during work.
As it was only my second time in a year, I thought lightly that I would take about a month off and say goodbye to the crappy company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't work, so it dragged on.
Anyway, it is important to seek treatment from a mental health clinic and receive proper care, as well as keeping a record of your medical history (which is extremely important).
If you have a medical history of going to the hospital, even if you quit your job for personal reasons, you can change it to being laid off by the company based on the doctor's judgment at Hello Work, so the hurdle for receiving unemployment insurance and so on will be greatly reduced.
Even if you can't find a job easily and want to take a break, you can still have some financial and emotional leeway.

Was Ginza an island?
"5 trivia selections you can talk about while wearing a silver bra (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News"
This place used to be a peninsula.
"As evidence, being able to show off some trivial knowledge like '... ' is unique to Ginza."
We will introduce interesting Ginza trivia that you will want to share with someone, once you know it.
"Going above Ginza!"
First infiltration into the gold seat.
As you walk through Ginza, you can see remnants of the history that Ginza has carved out, such as peculiar place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
While walking with her in Ginza, suddenly a silence came and she said, "This place used to be a peninsula in the past."
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Tokyo's Chuo Ward, known as the representative of bustling districts that have created "○○ Ginza" throughout Japan."
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a mint for silver coins, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office that was located in present-day Shizuoka City was relocated to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shinryogae-cho", but after moving to the Razor Shell Town, it came to be called by the nickname "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that Ginza used to be a "peninsula" that jutted out into the sea.
From before the Edo period, there were inlets extending from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo-maejima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of that peninsula corresponds to present-day Ginza.
After Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the bay and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the city blocks and constructed moats to promote water transportation.
And they dug up the soil from the moat, cut down the Kandayama hill, and filled in the bay.
There is a monument called "Birthplace of Ginza" indicating the site of the former Ginza City Hall in front of the Tiffany Ginza flagship store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), so why not try looking for it if you are interested.
"Only those who know it, know about the 'pilgrimage to the holy sites' in Ginza."
In Ginza, there is an annual event called "Ginza Hacchou Shrine Tour" which is a well-known "pilgrimage" among those in the know.
Among more than 10 sacred places, the most noticeable one would be the "Kabuki Inari Shrine" located in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
There are not a few people who visit the shrine standing at the right end of the Kabuki theater before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudouson" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizo Son" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
The "Houtou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyo Iwa Inari Shrine" are located deep in the alley and are not very noticeable, but the "Toyo Iwa Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichikawa Hanzoemon, and the "Success Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is not open to the public except during the Haccho Shrine tour.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bodhisattva are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their enshrined deity.
The "Inari Shrine," where a fox greets you in front of the main hall, was built extensively in areas with many farmers, as it is believed to bring good harvests of rice and other grains, known as "bumper crops."
As a result, it came to be said that there were benefits of prosperous business in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Ginza, the busiest district in Japan, faith began to spread.
What do you think about people who return home without getting vaccinated?

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because I had a sharp pain that felt like tooth sensitivity when I pressed or touched my front teeth.
The nerve has been removed and the hole remains open.
They said it was to make the pain go away quickly.
If I touch my teeth, it causes severe pain compared to before the treatment, but will it subside in a few days?

It will calm down in a few days.

A man's body was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV News) - Yahoo! News.
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down and dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the man.
According to the police, on the morning of the 12th before 11:30 am, a man was found lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidami, Moriyama-ku, and a passerby called 110 to report it.
It means "The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he died on the spot."

South Korean POSCO International acquires Australia's Senex Energy, expanding overseas gas field operations - Korean media (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News.
On the 12th, POSCO International announced that it had signed a stock acquisition agreement with Australian company Senex Energy, as well as an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
Currently, there are still procedures such as approval from the local subsidiary and approval at the Senex Energy shareholders' meeting remaining, and the acquisition process is scheduled to be completed in March of next year.
This acquisition will be the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case for POSCO International since its integration into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount is a total of 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International has decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy has decided to invest 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided to acquire the company because it expects the demand for natural gas to continue to increase sustainably even in the era of energy transition, and it anticipates that blue hydrogen based on natural gas infrastructure will divide the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure natural gas reserves of 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf), which is equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, and also secure on-site gas field personnel in Australia.

Originally, February had only one national holiday, which was the National Foundation Day on the 11th, but because the current emperor was born in February, the 23rd has become a holiday.

That knee pain might be "osteoarthritis of the knee"!
Different treatment methods depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial department: Lately, I have been experiencing persistent knee pain.
What are the possible illnesses that could be present?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee joint pain can vary, including injury, rheumatoid arthritis, gout attacks, and more.
Among them, the most common among Japanese people is "osteoarthritis".
Editorial department: Does this mean that the joints become deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joints is covered with cartilage, which plays a role in cushioning impacts and making joint movements smooth.
However, due to aging, obesity, intense sports, and other factors, the cartilage can wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it causes joint deformities and inflammation.
Editorial department: Does osteoarthritis occur in places other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
It can also occur in joints and attachments of fingers, neck, waist, big toe, hip joint, etc. besides the knee.
However, the most common case is when it occurs in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial department: What kind of structure does a joint have in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: Joints are formed by the combination of two bones with concave and convex surfaces.
And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage" and the area around the joint is wrapped with "joint capsule".
Editorial department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
There is a tissue called synovium in the inner layer of the joint capsule, which produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
The reason why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for making the movement of the knees smooth is because of that.
Editorial department: What symptoms occur when you have osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Joint cartilage has both viscosity and elasticity, and plays a role in preventing direct contact between bones.
It's like a role of a cushion, so to speak.
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause joint deformation, inflammation, and pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
It's just basic pajamas, but when my pajamas are in the wash or something, I wear sweatpants or something to sleep in!
Even heavy smokers, are there people who can quit smoking and people who can't?
Well, there are two types.
My acquaintance used to be a heavy smoker, but has completely quit now.
They seemed to have thought "I wonder if I should quit somehow" and ended up quitting just like that.

"3 selections of the 'Kaiji' series' gambling and games that can actually be experienced (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News"
The gambling manga series "Kaiji," which boasts explosive popularity mainly among male readers.
One of the highlights of this work is a life-threatening extreme game.
"Just looking at the photo makes my legs freeze... I'm going to challenge myself to cross the steel beam!"
Therefore, this time, I would like to verify the Kaiji games that can actually be played or have been put into practice through planning videos.
"The pachinko machine 'Swamp' full of traps that appeared in the gambling manga 'Kaiji' is here."
In the original work, Kaiji was shocked by the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball.
In this "swamp", there were large traps set up such as the "nail forest", "movable props", and the "3-tiered crane", and it was considered almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every trick in the book and ultimately resorted to a desperate measure of placing a vinyl water tank in the building and sinking the foundation to tilt it, successfully conquering it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball for 4,000 yen", and the difficulty has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The iron beam crossing, which was conducted as part of the "Star Side Party" organized by the wealthy as entertainment, included Kaiji and other debtors and was the human horse racing on the iron beam crossing.
The debtor advances while devising ways not to fall from the thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground, and competes for speed.
Twelve people can participate, and the top two can win a cash prize, but there are only four steel beams available, and safety measures are insufficient, making the risk of death quite high.
Although crossing this iron bridge is highly dangerous, it has been developed as a VR game and can also be experienced through the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the home stadium of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, the "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi".
At a height of 20 meters (equivalent to a 7-story building), there is a single iron bridge on the Eagle Bridge, and beyond that, the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge" are prepared, and you walk towards them.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Koala Kojima, on his own YouTube channel, gained attention by posting a video of himself walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming that it is an experience unique to Japan.
"E-Card" is a card game for two players.
Using one Emperor card, eight Citizen cards, and one Slave card for a total of ten cards, players divide into Emperor and Slave sides to play.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the drama, Kaiji competes against Tonegawa under the strict rule of "if he loses, he will have his ear cut off."
Kaiji, who realized that he was being read psychologically by a device that destroys ears like earphones that were ultimately attached to him after a great struggle, sensed and transmitted changes in his pulse and body temperature, and won by confusing Tonegawa by shaving his own ears to the extreme and pushing his body to abnormal levels.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other websites.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video where he played a game of E-Card against actor Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in a movie, which caused a buzz.
How about experiencing the feeling of being Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's a fact that reading manga can give you a taste of the feeling.
Why not try feeling the world view through the game?
"A gentle push towards the new year, with a large tiger ema at the Ken Gokoku Shrine | Yamagata Newspaper."
A large "tiger" ema (votive picture tablet) for next year's zodiac animal has appeared at the Kenkokusha Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of Art and Design who designed it visited the same shrine, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been commissioning original drawings for ema from students at Geidai since the year before last.
Out of the nine students in the Japanese painting course instructed by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga, Yui Tsuchiya (22 years old) from the third year had her work selected.
The large Ema is 3.3 meters wide and the height at the center is approximately 1.8 meters.
It is said that Mr. Tsuchiya drew an image of "sakura gently pushing the back stepping towards the new year".
The sight of a tiger stopping to admire the cherry blossoms was filled with the wish "to be able to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world."
Tsuchiya's designs are also depicted on ema (votive tablets) that are generally distributed.
Gonnoeki (Shinto priest) Kenichi Chiba (44) said, "I think it will be a help for everyone to overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano, where we want to continue living" and make proposals at a workshop for four high school students in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital.
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano city are working together on a workshop to consider "Tamano, a place we want to continue living in."
As part of the investigation and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Future Creation Center", we will compile the raw voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor and others.
"When do you have fun?"
In response to the facilitator's question, the students answered one after another, saying things like "when I'm having fun with a lot of people" and "when I'm playing the drums."
The first meeting was held at Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13th.
18 high school students and local residents discussed "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns that provide a sense of purpose" while moving between designated "islands" using the World Cafe method.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them by sticking them onto a sheet of paper.
"The town with many young people seems interesting. Transportation such as trains and buses are essential for livability."
Let's discuss further to see if there are any common points.
"Tamano, a third-year student (18) at Tamano Shokogyo High School, thought it was boring, but being able to cycle by the seaside is attractive."
The third-year students (18 years old) from Bina High School said, "Although there are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, it's nice to have a place rich in nature," and they discussed it with adults, showing that they not only recognized the challenges of the region but also its attractiveness.
In the second meeting of December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of their proposals.
We plan to invite the mayor, superintendent of education, and others to announce it in February of next year.
Director Rie Higashiri of the same center said, "If we can foster high school students' love for their hometown and provide an opportunity for young people to actively participate in community building, it would be great."
Magnitude 5.0 earthquake with seismic intensity of 4 in Kanto region, epicenter located in southern Ibaraki (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News.

"How to find it: New ways to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News"
A scarf is essential in winter, but do you ever find that the fabric gets in the way around your neck?
After wrapping it, it is good to balance it while looking in the mirror, but sometimes we hear people say they don't know the trick.
I was thinking that if there was a scarf that could be rolled up quickly without the cloth being bulky, I found something innovative.
The brand "COTTORI" has a scarf with a compact size, with the longer side measuring approximately one meter, which is smaller than the usual size.
"When I first saw it, I thought, 'Can it really be so short and still be able to wrap around?'"
Upon closer inspection, it appears that the fabric has been cut into long, thin strips and woven together to create a single piece, resulting in a mesh-like texture.
The netting is designed to allow the ends of a scarf to pass through.
Therefore, it is possible to wrap and fasten without tying the ends together.
It is very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless vests (or "vests without sleeves") are popular even as outerwear, but many people wear them with a scarf to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have a scarf like this.

The Beatles documentary that's on Disney Plus is super interesting.
It's a movie called "Get Buck" directed by Peter Jackson.
It feels fresh to see the Beatles portrayed in a lifelike way, as if they were right in front of you.
We are tense because it's just before disbandment, but it's not the dramatic tension that we had imagined.
While trying to organize things, there's Paul who's like "I know I'm annoying but..." and is a pain, George who's like "but..." and is whiny, John who seems unenthusiastic and is always late despite giving opinions and jokes in a relatively calm manner... and even the peacemaker Apple doesn't actively speak up much and just sits in the back with a "what a bother" expression.
We don't hate each other enough to fight like that, but there's a strong sense of "well, it's probably impossible for us to work together" in the air, which is a common feeling, and it's interesting that the Beatles had that kind of feeling too. It's like the dismantling of a legend or something.
"And then, even in such an atmosphere, when the performance begins, everyone is overflowing with talent."
The process of turning a simple phrase into "that famous song" while both parties are saying "how about this?" is amazing.
The moment when the title track "Get Buck" is completed is amazing.
The scene where the casual humming gradually turns into that "Zucha♪Zucha♪" with lyrics recorded firmly is amazing.
It's amazing to be able to see the process of composing music like this because it's not something that happens very often.
Well, it's obvious, but everyone is covered in oil, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems that we are still only on the first of three episodes, but my impression so far is that the biggest cause of the Beatles' breakup was not the band itself, but rather the surrounding environment.
Even though the four of them complain about this and that, they seem to have fun when they start making music, but when it comes to discussing the location of their live performance, the producer and advertising people start saying things like "The Beatles are the best in the world!" and it becomes clear that it's already out of the band's hands.
Well, since the director's interpretation is also included in documentaries, it may be that what Peter Jackson felt is reflected in it...
I heard that Paul is supervising it, so maybe that's why there are quite a few scenes where Paul seems like the bad guy.

I thought that they must have a serious personality and feel a sense of responsibility, which is why they have lost their peace of mind and composure.
Right now, I can't help but think that it's a little difficult to keep on living.
I used to work in sales, but I became extremely ill and changed jobs. Although I am not good at initiating sales activities myself, I realized that I am very suited to sales activities that are needed by customers. So, even though it was a different industry, I chose that kind of work and it made my job much easier.
I was told that I couldn't do it, but I think that if I can find something that I am even a little bit good at or capable of, my future life will become somewhat easier.
Of course, I think it's better to take a break and have a relaxed mind before considering this.
As I believe there is also daily life, if there are company unions, industrial doctors, or consultation windows, it may be good to consult with them as there may be some kind of system, so it seems advisable to consult once.
It would be good if we could live with a little more ease from now on.

"Tornadoes occur frequently in America causing significant damage due to the influence of unseasonable warmth and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News."
From the night of Friday the 10th to Saturday the 11th local time, multiple tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
Due to the strong cold air that moved southward in contrast to the record warmth for this time of year, the atmosphere became extremely unstable and it is believed that cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest to the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature on Thursday the 9th and Friday the 10th has risen to nearly 30℃.
Due to a strong cold air mass of -30℃ or lower descending southward at around 5500m altitude in an area that had become record warm, a vigorous front was formed due to a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It is believed that tornadoes have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The southern United States is an area where tornadoes are prone to occur, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of significant damage during this period.
During the winter season, there were nearly 150 tornado warnings issued in a single day, which was a record-breaking number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States received reports of over 400 tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday, the 10th, local time.
According to this, it is understood that there are two main concentrated areas divided by the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In the state of Kentucky, it is believed that a tornado reached the third strongest level on the EF scale (Fujita scale) which ranges from 1 to 6, with EF3 being one of the strongest. It is estimated that there were gusts of wind around 70m/s.
Depending on future investigations, there is a possibility that it may be classified as EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the Improved Fujita Scale) is used based on the Improved Fujita Scale to match the conditions of Japanese buildings and other factors.
There is a sufficient possibility that JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in America this time, could occur in Japan, and it could cause the collapse of wooden houses.

"Live broadcast of cries for help from under the debris of the "largest in history" tornado in the United States (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News"
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and Southern United States, President Biden solemnly expressed his opinion on the 11th (12th Japan time) that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in US history."
As reported by American news outlets such as CNN television.
Mr. Biden emphasized that "we will do everything as a federal government."
They explained, "The full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost, is still unknown."
There is a fear that the number of dead may exceed 100.
[Photo] Residents carrying household goods from damaged houses in Kentucky, which was hit by a tornado. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states including Kentucky.
There is a record of a tornado causing damage over a range of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in states such as Missouri in 1925, but according to a meteorological expert from CNN, it was estimated that this time it was the largest scale with a range of about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Kentucky, where the damage was significant, even the candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season suffered extensive damage.
At that time, there were 110 people working, but the building was destroyed and disappeared without a trace.
In the darkness, a woman became trapped under debris approximately 1.5 meters thick and unable to move. She felt the weight of the rescuers searching for her on top of the debris and sought help through a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone.
In the publicly broadcasted live stream, in addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, the sound of screams and another woman singing "Happy Birthday to You" while crying to distract from the fear could also be heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk who lives in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son due to a tornado warning and they were both safe.
Looking back, he said, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrifying sound like something erupting from the ground."
The police officers of Mayfield City Police Department said, "We will continue the search operation until it is no longer necessary."
"I don't know if it's been weeks, months, or years, but we continued our diligent rescue efforts."
In Illinois, a portion of the warehouse of the internet shopping giant Amazon collapsed, and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Trains have derailed due to impacts strong enough to detach the train cars, and highways are being frequently closed due to vehicle overturns and other impacts.
According to US web media, approximately 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are experiencing power outages.

"Living on welfare is tough, isn't it?"
"I'm praying that I can somehow do it."
If there were live-in job opportunities like hotels or resort work, it would be great to have both a place to live and a source of income, but in the current social situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems like there are few options.
I searched quickly and it seems like there is a website like this↓,
Live-in part-time or full-time job - Live-in job search navigation (SumiNavi)
There is a related search for "reasons for living-in jobs" so my colleagues seem to be mostly those kinds of people.

What does the term "specialist in obstetrics and gynecology" mean for a physician?
"A specialist doctor" is a physician who has graduated and has been practicing for 3 to 5 years.
It is also called "specialized doctor" or "late-stage resident physician".
The so-called "resident physician" refers to a physician in their first or second year after graduation, also known as an "intern."
Although it may be immature to say so, after 4-5 years, one becomes capable of providing a certain level of medical treatment and is entrusted with various tasks.

There has been a discourse since ancient times that the approach to the evaluation system of the star system differs.
Other countries deduct points from a 5-star rating, while Japan claims to add or deduct points from a neutral 3-star rating.
At the benchmark point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have completely different meanings between "there are deduction points" and "not a masterpiece but a good work".
If we base it on a five-star rating system, then "works with no flaws" and "works that are of the highest standard in every aspect" would be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a flaw in the system that does not indicate the meaning of the stars. However, since such a system is actually being used in that way, I am saying that I do not want to give it three stars (bad reputation).
Therefore, when trying to refute people who advocate for this type of discourse using Steam's binary evaluation, the conversation becomes disjointed.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and can accommodate the size of a regular hose?
The power capacity that can be obtained from USB is approximately 2A at 5V, so it is at most 10W.
The power consumption of a water pump depends on the type, but it consumes at least around 500W, so it's impossible to do it without it.

"Self-made radio volume."
I made an AM radio with my own capacitor and coil, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I did hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio station than the one I tuned to.
There is a possibility that the tuning was not precise enough and it couldn't be heard clearly, but it was different from the expected station.
The main point here is that I was supposed to have made an AM radio, but it seems like I can hear an FM radio.

"Saga Food Diary: 'Seasonal fried fish and shrimp with homemade tartar sauce, caught in the nearby sea' from 'hakobune'" | Lifestyle and Culture | Saga Newspaper News | Saga Newspaper LiVE.
Bento box "Seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce."
"Hakobune" is a takeout specialty store for colorful bento boxes and deli (prepared foods) that abundantly use vegetables.
"Opened by the couple Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Yumi Katsuki (38) in August of last year, with the aim of allowing people to experience a restaurant atmosphere even at home."
One of the popular menu items for bento is "Seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best available at the market.
As Takayuki-san says, "To be able to taste the texture of the ingredients, we make the bread crumbs as thin as possible." This is why you can directly taste the crispy texture of the shrimp in the shrimp fry.
The bento box comes with a side of vegetables, about four types of deli meats, Saga Prefecture's Hinohikari rice mixed with grains, and soup.
Vegetables are sourced from the nearby homemade fields and local direct sales outlets in the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Kikou-san has trained in French cuisine and adds color with dishes such as ratatouille and lapin.
On the other hand, they have made it a blend of Japanese and Western cuisine that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, with a comforting taste that people are accustomed to, such as dashimaki tamago (according to Yumi-san).
The bento box "Handmade hamburger with domestically produced ground beef" (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also release a "charcuterie set" of meat products that pair well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to come across something interesting at Haneda Airport, so I decided to try it out.
The ride is not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not enough to make you feel sick).
"Naturally slow speed."
I think it's safe to slow down or even come to a complete stop when there are people around for safety reasons, but depending on the location, it can be dangerous.
The stares from those around me are painful. It's not that being looked at is bad, but being looked at with a feeling of "you're in the way" hurts my heart.
Overall, it's not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be more user-friendly if there were fewer people or if they could move to the side to make room.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create dedicated lanes and take care not to obstruct pedestrians.
However, because I was taking it easy and enjoying the scenery, I thought it would be a better ride if there were fewer people, as I could relax and take my time while looking at the view.
In the future, I wonder if this kind of self-driving technology will become mainstream, and it's both exciting and satisfying to feel the sense of near-future anticipation, as well as the discomfort of being watched by others. It's a difficult vehicle to handle, and requires a lot of patience and mental fortitude.

If you look closely, you might understand a little, but this is an eel-free "fake" unagi bowl.
Actually, it's "eggplant"! (The answer will appear when you tap it.)
"I like eel, but I used to think that everyone just ate it with sauce and that the actual cooking of the eel didn't matter. But then I realized that the texture and amount of eel are actually important."
I don't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
Recipe used: EGGPLANT "UNAGI" - Woks of Life (replaced scallions with sansho pepper).
It's a simple dish where you just fry the steamed food with sauce on a frying pan, but it takes about 30 minutes to make.

On the 12th, a man was slashed and another man fled on a motorcycle in an attempted murder case in Oaza, Saga City.
Around 1:25 am on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was attacked with a knife by a man believed to be in his 30s to 40s on the street in Oomaza 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him as a attempted murder suspect.
According to the Nanjo Police Station, there was a report to 110 emergency services from a passerby saying "there is a fight happening".
The man suffered a wound of about 10 centimeters in length and 1 centimeter in depth on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who ran away is of medium build and has a shaved head.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was found near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking with several acquaintances, and they are investigating some kind of traffic trouble between the male pedestrian and the male on the motorcycle.

The long journey of a family that established environmental protection activities in the border areas of China (JBpress) - Yahoo! News.
Kato Yuuki, a business consultant for Find Asia in Hong Kong, says that China, with its vast territory, is important not only in terms of biodiversity, but also has the highest number of mammal species and is third in the world in terms of plant species.
Some local governments not only recognize the value of biodiversity, but also promote the activities of environmental activists in addition to their own environmental protection efforts.
Yunnan Province's Xishuangbanna, located in the southwestern part of China, is also one of those regions.
My younger sister Li Wanda is currently active as an actress. Xieng Khouang is an area that borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Dai (Thai) people" who share roots with the Thai people of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through various Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The area of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, also known as Sipsongpanna, accounts for only about 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to approximately 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, I had the opportunity to meet Li Mingguo, who is conducting environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and hear about the details of his activities on site.
I heard that she started environmental protection activities with her German husband and it has been 20 years since they began.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tenmoku" started in 2000.
The trigger for that is my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and he came to Sisavangvong for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasts a high level of biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, there was also a delay in economic development.
Therefore, in order to establish industries in this region and to produce rubber that was in short supply within China, large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforests had previously occurred.
My husband was dispatched here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and research on biological resources.
And then, I met my spouse here while working as a journalist.
Before that, did Li not have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Li, I am from Chiang Mai, but I was not interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or biodiversity.
As a result, she ended up promoting the project with her husband without any knowledge about it.
Sometimes I see people who have an aura, even though their face is not particularly attractive and they are not especially tall. Why do you think that is?
"A popular actor said."
Aura is not something that can be emitted just by thinking about it.
"When you have confidence in yourself, it naturally comes out."
That person probably has a strong sense of confidence within themselves.

Did you praise them in detail or something?

This is a personal memo about a problem with a mod causing CTD in my game environment, which took about a month and a half to identify.

During camera work for activating kill moves against certain NPCs, turning off kill move settings by PC via .ini file improved the basic settings, possibly due to conflicts with DAR and Nemesis settings. However, the limit has not reached even 10,000 DAR animation numbers.
While moving in the field (mostly outdoors) and using some magic (such as the ice rune), after hitting an NPC, turn off all SPID settings for Dirt & Blood v 2.0 (located in the upper right of MCM) and repeat the process five times until all issues are resolved.
Did the mistake in the shader settings for additional armor and body mesh worn by an actor/NPC cause this? Also, although there is a formatting mistake in the default.ini for SPID usage in 2.0, it should result in the intended outcome of applying prerequisite perks to NPCs.
Initially, we focused on checking motion/combat mods (in .dll format) related to targeted attacks and OnHit effects, but this is the kind of result we ended up with.
I think there were no similar bug reports at least at the level of English, German, or French.
If there happens to be anyone in a Japanese environment who is facing similar CTD problems, I thought it might be helpful to post this as a reference for future use.
Most people are doing it with a mental state that is just barely holding up.
No one around notices it, not even my colleagues, let alone my family.
Sometimes when I look around, I optimistically think that person seems to be struggling, but they are doing their job energetically.
However, he probably also has a fragile mental state.
I didn't resign under the pretext of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before resigning.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric home nursing - after today's home visit nursing is finished.
Because I suffer from bipolar disorder, I have been receiving long-term home nursing care, and I have been in a good relationship with the female nurse from the home nursing station I am currently using for a long time.
Every week, we have various conversations.
Of course, they also take care of things necessary for medication management (such as unit-dose packaging), but above all, I deeply realized today during the home visit nursing how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental illness.
Today, we ended up discussing gender theory and topics related to the differences between men and women.
We also talk about things like sexual desire between men and women, or why she got divorced, and wonder if it's appropriate to discuss such topics during home nursing visits.
Sometimes, but not often, I cross-dress.
However, I have heard from an acquaintance that in the case of a visiting nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, there are elderly female nurses who can no longer work on the ward and only provide administrative support, and occupational therapists who come for home visits are given orders in a condescending manner such as "we are the ones providing medical care".
The small visiting nursing station that I am using is managed by a social welfare corporation, but I think the nurses there are really good because they treat me, someone with a mental illness, as an equal and are frank with me.
By the way, she is beautiful, haha.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home nursing care, and there may also be people who are considering receiving it.
Home nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely receive it.
And, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, there were times when I couldn't get along with someone and I had to terminate the contract myself.
I'm sorry for the poor writing.
I know it's a fake warning, but I got scared when it came up in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several things that are thought to be the cause, but for example...
I don't know what the creator is displayed as in Japanese.
Faulty language detection.
The browser settings are set to prioritize English.
The ranking of the appearance frequency in the number of times of the lottery 6 is in ascending order of the least frequent, and all of them are odd numbers.
Why is it difficult to roll odd numbers?
It's mysterious.
There seems to be a certain pattern in appearance.
It repeats or continues.

"South Korea's hydrogen technology patents are one-fifth of China's... "Delay in fulfilling the hydrogen economy roadmap" (Chosun Ilbo Japanese version) - Yahoo! News"
The South Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The plan was to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 (cumulative) and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, fuel cell vehicles only reach the target level of 27% (about 17,000 units) based on the November standard this year.
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations, which are core infrastructure, is also at 38% of the target (approximately 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per kilometer is around 8,400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been found that the government's progress in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap is significantly below the target value.
The National Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) announced on the 12th the publication of a report titled "Current Status and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
The core materials of fuel cell vehicles, such as carbon fibers, are supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane films by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), and others.
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has been increasing at an average annual rate of 14% since 2014.
In the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells, South Korea ranks fifth in the world in the number of patents (cumulative from 2014 to 2020).
However, the Keidanren reported that "in reality, six countries dominate the majority of the global hydrogen market, and in fact, this means that they are ranked lower among competing countries."
The country ranking for patents is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan in that order.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States and has been widening the gap between them.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1,033 for South Korea, surpassing Japan's 974 and ranking fourth, but it is only at 22% of China's 4,721.
The Keidanren proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax deduction for facility investment and research and development expenses."

The fact that PS5 is being sold at a high price is only due to its rarity value and its value has increased above the regular price.

"US aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, also engaged in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News"
Officials from the US State Department reported on the 12th that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, based on the security assistance plan approved by President Biden, had arrived in Ukraine.
Military aid worth approximately 60 million dollars (about 6.8 billion yen) will be transported to Ukraine, including four radars to identify launch points for mortars and other equipment, by the beginning of next year.
According to John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of Defense, the aid included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles called "Javelins".
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, which have been affected by Russia's military buildup around the Ukrainian border.
The United States is increasing its vigilance against Russian military movements, consulting with NATO member countries, and devising response measures in case Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden had approved military aid when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House on September 1st of this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
The total amount of aid since Russia forcibly annexed Crimea from Ukraine has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also engaged in training missions with the Ukrainian military.
Last month, they dispatched the National Guard of Florida in accordance with the multinational joint training plan to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Forces in Europe are also playing a significant role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating within Ukraine has not been disclosed as a matter of operational security.
President Biden had an online meeting with President Putin of Russia on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense exchanges regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also prepared to impose harsh economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The fate of the "review" of inheritance and gift taxes that prohibit pre-death gifts is directly questioned to Akira Amari, former chairman of the tax committee of the Liberal Democratic Party.
The first feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking with Family during the Year-End and New Year Holidays!"
This is "Pre-death gift and last-minute inheritance technique" in English.
While the discussion of integrating inheritance tax and gift tax is progressing, the 2022 tax reform outline, which was a concern, was postponed, but in the near future, there is a high possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the mainstay of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden move".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
We will teach you everything from the basics of gift giving and inheritance for last-minute, advantageous gifts that can be made before the end of the year, to tax-saving techniques, along with a direct hit on former tax committee chairman and member of the House of Representatives, Akira Amari of the Liberal Democratic Party.
(Diamond editorial department, Keiaki Miyahara)
"Prohibiting the use of lifetime gifts from wealthy individuals to urban employees, in order to establish a neutral tax system for the timing of asset transfers, from the perspective of comprehensively capturing inheritance and gift taxes, and to proceed with full-scale consideration."
A sentence in the 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year caused significant unrest not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because the intended meaning is to drastically change the rules of inheritance and to increase inheritance tax by prohibiting the widely accepted "gifts during one's lifetime" strategy for inheritance tax planning.
The golden rule for tax-saving measures for high progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce the taxable assets."
The strongest trump card, which is the gift while alive, has been widely utilized not only by wealthy people but also by salaried workers who may incur a small amount of inheritance tax due to owning a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst all that, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although the fastest implementation was a concern, it was postponed in the 22nd fiscal year tax reform outline announced on December 10th. However, more detailed statements were made towards integration, such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax settlement taxation system and calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures for gift tax do not require any tax burden for asset transfers within families within the limit, and will be continuously reviewed."
In response to an interview by our editorial department, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax System Research Commission and former secretary-general Akira Amari said.
The most important thing is to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages depending on the timing of property transfer and to make the tax burden the same no matter when it is done.
"At present, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise from integration. If the fastest revision is made, there will be three remaining chances for lifetime gifts."
Even if not now, it seems inevitable that in the near future, there will be a significant shift towards invalidating pre-death gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, specifically, how will the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My righteous older brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10, 2022. Yuudai Furukawa says, "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Big Brother" starring Yudai Kojima will be broadcast on terrestrial television on Fuji TV from late night on January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Starring as the heroine, Hanjuku Yamatani, this work is based on the manga of the same name by Satoshi Morie, serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018. It is a heart-wrenching love story between a man and a woman burdened by their past.
Haru, the protagonist, is played by Furukawa, and Rize, the heroine, is played by Yamatani Hanajun.
Rie, a college student, meets her senior coworker, Kairi.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who, for some reason, can sleep soundly when he leans on Rie's shoulder.
Rise is attracted to Kairi, who resembles her estranged brother, but she begins to suspect that Kairi may be a murderer due to a certain incident.
Yudai Furukawa commented that the drama "My Righteous Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
For those who were unable to see it at FOD, I would like them to look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, I think they can understand the complex psychological portrayal of Umi and Rise, their struggles and changes, and get to know this work more deeply by watching their development.
I would be happy if even the original fans could enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!
Live comfortably with a beautiful and graceful life.

What did the players of the team that won with only 3 passes in one game feel and think? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News.
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
This was the lowest number of passes in the NFL in the past 50 years since the Bills recorded only two passes in the third week of the 1974 game against the New York Jets.
The 1974 Bills had a once-in-a-generation talented RB named O.J. Simpson, who had become the first player in history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season the previous year.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs from Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the border with Canada, and latitude-wise it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with winds blowing at 18 meters per second, and it was snowing heavily before the game.
As a local team, the Bills didn't change their play selection too much.
"Out of 30 passes, Ran made 25."
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was not necessarily a failure.
In 10 offensive series, there were 4 red zone penetrations and scoring opportunities.
Especially in the latter part of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three attempts, we were only able to score three points in one FG.
Defense in front of the goal during the final stage of the game.
The Bills, who were chasing four points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
On 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the rush of the Patriots defense and escaped from the pocket, flowing to the right.
And he threw a pass aiming for TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, the ace WR Stefon Diggs who was on the right outside was running a shallow cross and was open in front of the end zone, but it seems that it didn't catch Allen's eye.
On 4th and 18, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis who ran into the end zone from the left outside, but the pass was knocked down by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in front of him, resulting in a failed attempt.
Bryant was covering Bills' WR Cole Beasley man-to-man, but he let him go after seeing Allen's movement and reacted to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked two receivers, threw passes aiming for the end zone twice.
The 4th down pass may have been a predetermined play, but on 3rd down, there was no need to aim for a touchdown.
You just need to get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still two minutes before, if they had gone for 4th & Short, Allen's ability to run would have come into play.

It's time to throw away and replace these 3 items that tend to be left in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News.
Sponge.
No matter how often you change it, the sponge is probably not replaced as frequently as recommended.
From a study conducted in 2017, it was found that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, a lot of bacteria still multiply (however, it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends replacing the sponge once a week to maintain cleanliness.
"Manaita" (This is a Japanese word and it means "cutting board" in English.)
The United States Department of Agriculture recommends replacing cutting boards when they begin to wear out and develop scratches or grooves.
Once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria multiply.
If it is still safe, do not forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid and leave it for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry by either air-drying naturally or lightly patting with a clean paper towel to remove excess water.
Dishes that are chipped or cracked.
It may be painful to dispose of my favorite mug, but the chipped surface could become a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
In addition, it can also be a cause of cutting the lips or spilling drinks in the missing parts.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
"Yu Jin, the builder, posted about Guan Yu's heroic death by drowning."
"Yu Jin, save General Guan Yu from drowning."
Yu Jin "Yes, sir."
"Even if 30,000 arrows were to rain down on him, Yu Jin wouldn't die."
"Ussu" (This is a casual greeting in Japanese, similar to "Yo" or "Hey")
"I won't die even if I'm run over by a tiger tank."
"Ussu" (This is a casual greeting in Japanese, similar to "Yo" or "Hey")
"I won't die even if I'm swallowed by the turbid current of the Han River."
"Ussu" (This is a casual greeting in Japanese, similar to "Yo" or "Hey")
"So, can you withstand the water torture and underwater bridge for three hours?"
"Ussu ussu" (This is not a meaningful sentence in English, but rather a sound or expression commonly used in Japanese.)
"Then make sure to practice so you can endure until the next Battle of Fan Castle!"
"Yo!"
"Because it's a promise, right?"
"Roger, I got it!"
"Someday, I won't even know if you're killed by Cao Cao!"

For some reason, I feel embarrassed to own brand-name products.
I can carry something that doesn't stand out, but I can't carry something like Louis Vuitton with a monogram boldly displaying "LV" on it.
What could be the reason?
I think it's good to have something that fits your size.
By the way, I think it would be good in Japan.
If it's Japan, then it is .
It doesn't matter if someone looks like a foreigner or not.
It's better to say it early, "Why are you calling me by my first name/casual language only?"
If someone says "Isn't it irrelevant because you're a foreigner?" and it makes you uncomfortable, it's better to simply say so.
I don't think I even dream that they are probably feeling unpleasant with a fair probability.
I was living abroad for a while, and among the Japanese people who went outside, including myself, there were quite a few who didn't like the strict Confucian customs of hierarchy. Some of them seemed to have lost their sense of propriety and mistakenly thought they could say anything to the locals.
If they appear to be Westerners, I think they are doing it with a certain kind of affection or friendly feeling, not with any ill intention.
Even if they are my friends from Europe or America, I usually call them by their first name, but sometimes I hesitate whether to do the same when speaking in Japanese.
Well, it's still okay if it's just a friend though.
Originally, they are just doing it normally and purely, but if you overlook it, they may lose their restraint and become an exception to the treatment just because they are foreigners, so it's better to say it now.
It feels like they're saying, "Since we're in Japan, could you please speak using Japanese rules?"
Edit: I apologize for the previous incorrect translation. Here is the corrected translation:\n\nPractice: It's unrelated, but my white friend who naturalized always raises his glass higher than younger people when we cheers at drinking parties.
I am definitely aware of it, but I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese person, not being underestimated by younger or older people when I act that way.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, have a lot of people (including myself) who pay attention to small details like that, so it sucks.

Thank you to the 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, I found out that this newly created subreddit had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm extremely happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today alone, so I am extremely grateful.
If anyone who subscribed to this subreddit today could kindly let me know in the comments how they found out about it, I would be grateful! (I have no idea, so I'm really curious.)
As there is no one else currently creating threads, it would be appreciated if everyone could create threads.
It would be encouraging if you could leave comments even without creating a thread.
I wonder if there are few people who use Twitter even though they use Reddit.
If you're someone who uses Twitter, please consider starting a thread as well!
Finally, thank you very much! The subreddits I created before didn't attract enough people and I quickly gave up, but this time, thanks to all of you, I feel like I can continue without giving up.

As I only have a limited ability to understand English, I will rely solely on the translated text to make judgments.
The translated text feels a bit awkward in the sentence, but I understand what it's trying to convey and it doesn't affect the gameplay, so I think it's at an acceptable level. However, this is just my personal opinion, and it might be worth asking others for their thoughts.
I feel that this level of translation is often seen in games produced overseas, and if it is a small company, it is well translated.
I think that for non-native Japanese speakers, understanding the subtle nuances of the Japanese language may be achievable only after a long period of study.
I don't know what level you are seeking, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, it may be better to look for someone else.

The training in "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba" is the battle.
"Equal exchange for effort" is a hymn to humanity <Anime "Yukaku-hen" start commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News.
What makes "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba" particularly unique among recent boys' manga is that there is an excessive amount of training.
In general, it is a well-established theory that training arcs where there are no battles, and characters simply train day in and day out, are not popular among readers.
Even in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", it can be inferred from the fact that they only briefly depicted the separation of the Straw Hat crew and then skipped ahead two years that they underwent intense training during that time.
Well, one of the charms of One Piece is its eccentricity that comes from traveling across different lands, and staying in one place to train may not always be a good match.
Well, it can be said that the training of the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", Tanjiro, began when he knelt down to Tomioka Giyu, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of his sister, Nezuko, who had tried to take his life, and Giyu told him, "Do not let others hold the power of life and death over you!"
The weak have no rights or choices, and are simply overpowered by the strong through force in every situation.
While saying so, it was the kindness of Giyuu to introduce Sakonji Urokodaki, who trains the hopefuls of the Demon Slayer Corps, as a "trainer" (although he is also bad at explaining his intentions in communication).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked him, "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" and Tanjiro was at a loss for an answer, to which Rengoku responded with a slap and said, "You're slow to make decisions."
Even among fans, it is a seemingly unreasonable exchange that has become a topic of conversation.
However, walking around with a sister who has become a demon carries the possibility of being forced to make such a judgment at any moment.
It can be said that the initiation to practice begins with one's mindset.
However, Rindaki takes the inexperienced Tanjiro, who has not even trained yet, to Mt. Sagiri and orders him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountains are full of traps like pitfalls, catapults, and other obstacles, and the air is thin, so it seems like one might die before beginning their training.
However, with his natural sharp sense of smell, he barely manages to avoid traps set by human hands by detecting the faint scent of the trap, which is only possible due to his "protagonist's privilege".
However, the essence of Demon Slayer is to make Tanjiro say, "Just because of that, it's not like I suddenly became so physically capable that I can avoid everything!!"
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become strong without any basis, and awakening only allows them to use the power and skills they have honed up until then to their true potential.
The principle of "equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who work hard in proportion to their efforts and does not reward those who do not work hard, is a human hymn that differs from demons who possess baseless supernatural powers, and is an unshakable rule that is consistent throughout this work.
Is this old?
Sleeping directly on a mat with a futon and a comforter, instead of on a bed, is a way of sleeping.
Because my house is not a condominium.
I do that too.
If you want to use the room more widely, it's better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are also many people like that.
Is it greedy?
Is it greedy for someone who works part-time and wants to work full-time and also work at another store?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, it doesn't fit my idea of "greedy".
I think that trying to gain more profit than effort by scheming with minimal effort is considered "greedy".

South Korean company Samsung Electronics has established a new "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing the user experience. (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News.
Following the integration of its CE and IM divisions as a set department, Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in the year-end organizational restructuring.
The intention to enhance user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances can be inferred.
Samsung Electronics revealed that its newly established DX department, which integrates the CE and IM divisions, consists of business units such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
Samsung Electronics officials explained that "this name change reflects our medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership."
In addition, it emphasized the intention to enable consumers to easily enjoy optimized experiences through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, not only products such as televisions, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
As part of the establishment of an integrated leadership structure, the strategy of creating synergies across organizational boundaries and building a foundation for differentiated products and services on a company-wide scale was also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to enable users to freely use content and services through inter-device linkage of appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Does 1500 BCE mean "Before Common Era"?

BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era (before AD).

"They lie in wait with their jaws ready, only their armored heads visible above the sand... anything that falls into their pit is impaled and pulled beneath."

This is a little unnatural here.
The larvae of the mantis shrimp lie in wait in the sand, with only their disc-shaped heads peeking out, in order to be able to catch their prey at any time.
I think it should be.
What's concerning is...
Did you refer to other documentaries?
Are you looking at it from the perspective of an ant?
Is that so?
If you translate "armoured heads" as "disc-shaped heads", I think the part that says "it is a giant beast wearing a helmet on the scale of ants" will disappear.
"Aichi Channel 24 collision, trailer driver has no medical condition, was it due to carelessness? (TV Asahi network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News"
It has been revealed that the driver of the trailer, who was arrested and sent for prosecution in the accident where 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, did not have any pre-existing medical conditions and is believed to have caused the accident due to some form of negligence.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people suffered minor injuries.
The police arrested suspect Masaya Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer and allegedly caused a rear-end collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him for prosecution on the morning of the 12th.
Even after the accident, the trailer of suspect Nomura continued to move without applying the brakes, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura had temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, it has been found that Mr. Nomura did not have any pre-existing medical conditions and that some form of negligence is believed to be the cause.
The police are conducting a thorough investigation by searching the homes of related parties and examining the circumstances at the time.

"Oginuma X's Kiniku Man Review [Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Playboy News) - Yahoo! News"
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in volume 3, concludes in this 4th volume!
In contrast to the previous volume that depicted everything from the opening to the semifinals, this volume focuses only on one battle, which is packed with new elements!
"Kinnikuman Volume 4 Review by reviewer Ogiuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) - Superhuman pro wrestling has already begun before the match!"
To put it simply, this fourth volume is a book that carefully and thoroughly depicts the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but it's important to note that it's not just a volume that depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, there are battles of wits and training scenes between the two sides, which is quite different from before and the game doesn't start easily, but it is never boring.
The feeling in the story where the tension gradually increases as the long-awaited battle of the century is about to begin, is definitely linked to the rise in the reader's excitement, and I am full of admiration for the meticulously calculated production even during this period.
And before the important final, there is another must-see event, which is the third place playoff between Terryman and Ramenman.
Not only the luxury of the match card, but what I like is Ramenman saying to Kinikuman's poster backstage before the match, "From now on, I'll be the one aiming for the top!!"
"And he tries to strike with a chop."
However, Terryman happened to pass by and intercepted the strike, and they stared at each other in silence before parting ways, leaving the scene at that.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, so there's no chance to fight against Kinnikuman in this tournament anymore.
However, there are people who are troubled by the Kinikuman issue.
If I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think about my future success!
"This is a moment that still makes me painfully aware as a manga artist of what it means to have a well-defined character!"
The battle between those two didn't take up much time, but the memorable scene was Ramenman's tearful plea after the match.
"Don't rely solely on divine luck for your strength in Kinnikuman!"
This is a line of dialogue.
This is more like a grand meta-statement about the work itself, but I think up until now, readers have had a vague feeling that Kiniku Man always wins because he's the protagonist, and that he's been winning in places where it doesn't really make sense based on his actual abilities.
However, by making Ramenman say this statement, Yudetamago-sensei has proactively nailed down that he can no longer use that move.
With this one word, the readers are left wondering, "Wait, does that mean Kiniku Man is going to defeat Robin with his actual strength?"
"How?"
This will again stir up our imagination with a development that cannot be foreseen, and from another perspective as a writer, this line is like a self-imposed restriction for the author who creates the work, like a boiled egg.
"I'm impressed by what was done here."

Winter illumination to be held on weekends at Aobayama, Takahama-cho (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At the Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is wrapped in gentle light.
The winter illumination that started on November 26th, including a 20-meter tall spruce tree, has 50,000 LED bulbs scattered throughout the walking paths and lawns. (December 12th)
Visitors from Shiga prefecture said, "It's been a long time since we came to Fukui, and we were surprised to find such a place."
"I was saying that it was really beautiful and relaxing."
The illumination was first planned to provide healing while avoiding crowds, and is lit from 5pm to 8:30pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day, December 25th, there are plans to hold a Christmas event featuring a serving of button-nabe hot pot and a movie screening.

It seems that you should remember only the parts you skipped while reading ahead, rather than trying to remember everything, and read them when necessary.
I gradually started to read because I repeated the process of breaking things without reading anything first.
The child has developed a rash on their body.
Day by day, it is getting bigger in size.
Is this caused by dryness and resulting in eczema?
It's better to see a dermatologist as soon as possible.
As we will be closed during the year-end and New Year holidays, it is better to respond promptly for the sake of your child.

"Internet broadcasting, promotion of agricultural and livestock products: Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association broadcasts from Yonezawa."
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, consisting of cities and towns in the Okitama region and JA, utilized "live commerce" to promote agricultural and livestock products through online video streaming while selling products.
The "National Collaboration MINATO Market TV," which was planned for the first time by the Minato Ward in Tokyo, featured a remote appearance by the Yamagata Ai no Bushotai and delivered the region's charm along with local specialties.
Thanks to the collaborative effort between the Okitama region and Minato Ward, the "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project," a store was established through this connection, and it was broadcasted from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mikka Kuroda, who is active as a "satoyama sommelier", wears a stole from the Yonezawa weave brand "nitorito" and introduces the charm of the region surrounded by nature.
We also reported on the state of the sweet potato party with the Love Warriors.
At the Tokyo studio, comedian Emiko Kawamura from the comedy duo "Tampopo" and YouTubers with over 300,000 subscribers tasted local sake, wine, Miyagi beef, and Tsuya-hime rice from the Okitama region.
When conveying the deliciousness to the viewers, comments such as "Even though it's a stream, I can smell it" and "There are so many delicious things to drink, it's the best" were flying around in praise.
Is there a way to POST what was obtained from a form on the same PHP page?
If there is a value in the <input> element in the form, it will be posted.
Isn't it something like that?
I am thinking of planting bellflowers in the garden.
Is the balloon flower resistant to summer heat?
If so, when the flowers finish in spring, let's cut the stems leaving 10-15cm.
Please look forward to the branches growing from the base of the leaves.
Happy New Year!
I just came back from Hatsumode (first shrine visit of the year) with my girlfriend.
Her smile is lovely even in the new year.
This is a question.
How will you spend New Year's?
Please tell me.
Happy New Year!
"Being lovey-dovey is nice, isn't it? ＼(^o^)／"
Unfortunately, this morning...
The power of the PC used for NAS stopped turning on 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉.
"What happened?"
In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
After returning to the room a little later, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought that the fan's movement had only deteriorated due to a decrease in room temperature (6℃).
Therefore, I decided to warm up the room and try again.
Not starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp lights up and the fan moves for a moment, but quickly stops.
After that, they didn't say a word.
I tried unplugging the power plug and testing it again, but it still only turns on for a moment.
I tried connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pin and 4-pin connectors and removing all other parts to test, but it did not start up.
I have suspected that the PSU may be the cause because there has been a buzzing sound like "bubububu" as if the PSU fan has been hitting something for a while.
I will try out the spare ATX power supply that I found at a later date.
"Maybe."
If it doesn't work out...what should I do?
Should I change the case and motherboard together...
Have you seen any wild rabbits recently (within the past 4-5 years)?
Where did you see it?
Are you surrounded by nature?
I live in the Tohoku region.
"They can be found anywhere near my place."
They can also be found in gardens and company parking lots.
"2021, the most frequently used emoji ranking (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News"
My most frequently used emoji is the crying face.
I think that emojis are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there are many messaging apps and chat tools that allow emoji reactions instead of just stickers.
Speedy, easy, no need to reply, and soothing elements.
In modern communication, emojis are essential for creating a soft atmosphere that is highly valued.
So, what kind of emojis is everyone using?
"View the full picture: Ranking of the most commonly used emojis in 2021 - Top 10 emojis used worldwide in 2021!"
Overall, positive and bright emojis have ranked in.
According to Unicode, the source of the material, 92% of the world's internet population uses emojis.
I heard that the first place accounts for 5% of the total usage of all emojis!
The crying-laughing emojis in first, third, and fifth place are very convenient to use, aren't they?
When it's fun, when it's happy, and of course, I did it!
At times when you feel like there's nothing you can do, there are probably quite a few people who use self-deprecating humor.
On the contrary, people who have never used any of the top 10 emojis even once are extremely rare.
I want them to stick to that style.

How do you dispose of your personal computer and peripheral devices?
"PC farm"
I have only brought it in once, but even though it is located in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, they will not collect it for free from Saitama Prefecture.
If it's relatively new, there is a free option.
Inverse net.
I have never used it before, but it seems that Sagawa offers completely free shipping with cash on delivery.
If anyone knows about it, I would like to hear their reviews because I am thinking of trying it.
"Bulky waste (for a fee), addition> Municipal collection boxes (small household appliances for free)"
Sell it secondhand.
Addendum: Mercari, Hard Off.
I wonder if there are people who sell on flea markets or auctions? I have never sold a used PC before.
Selling while it's still profitable may also be a wise choice.
Addendum: Information provided by Linet Japan /u/CheetahPresent8059
Broken printers, old UPSs, and the like that no one will take away are starting to get in the way.
Since it's not considered bulky waste, it probably won't cost any money, but it's being postponed for some reason.
I am collecting coins as a hobby.
Please tell me if you know the value of this coin.
Coins circulating in foreign countries have no value.
In Japan, paper money can be exchanged, but coins cannot be exchanged.
If it is a commemorative gold coin, it contains gold and therefore has value.
Do you ever dislike someone even though they didn't do anything wrong?
Yes, it's natural for humans to have likes and dislikes.
"(For no reason) I dislike something", those who dislike something are like that.

"I can't get a girlfriend, but is it because I'm being discriminated against based on my appearance?"
It's not about the face, it's about the heart.
However, it's sad that things can be decided based on appearance.
"I can't show my inner self."
What did you do with your school athletic uniform after graduation?
I wear it as casual clothing ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
My wife used to wear loungewear until we started living together, haha.
Is it possible for people to become "リア充" (someone who is fulfilled in their real life) at any time, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?
Although sexual desire and youth are lost completely.
If you are healthy.
Men's volleyball advances to the final tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's fencing's Frere finishes in 4th place, failing to win a medal.
"Dragon God Japan, first time in 29 years to reach the quarterfinals! Men's volleyball Japan national team advances to the finals tournament. Coach Nakagai says, "It was a big goal.""
I thought it was hopeless when we lost the third set with two referee challenges, but we won in a full set.
The men's fencing team in the foil category did not win a medal for Japan and was defeated by the United States.
I think they were exceptional compared to the opponents until the semifinals, but why is such an opponent in the third-place playoff?
I want to plant trees in my garden that will serve as a privacy screen. If you have any recommended trees, please let me know.
As a hope, it would be good to have an evergreen tree that is easy to maintain and preferably bears fruit.
"Thank you in advance" or "Please be kind to me"
To bear fruit on a feijoa tree, it is better to plant other fruit-bearing trees nearby such as olive, blueberry, plum, and others.
How much savings do we need to comfortably live together?
It depends on the person.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It's better to stop cohabitation.
There is a high possibility of breaking up.
It is better to properly arrange a matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, visit various bridal shops, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
There are no benefits to cohabitation.
I think it would be better to stop, but...
Today, I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it turned out to be a reprinted legendary rare. (^_^;)
Is it okay to play games using cards like Ganbarizing as a hobby?
I think it's an ant.
