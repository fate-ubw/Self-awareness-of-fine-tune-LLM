Is there a way to punish him?
In order to prevent such a thing from happening again.
Or how much longer will the restaurant take to prepare? Can you help me ask?
At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students took the lead role and their research results sparked great imagination. - Xinhua News Agency
Washing hands with air, diagnosing diseases by exhaling, and accurately searching for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year at Zhejiang University, a series of imaginative academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, and some of these projects have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensors: Your family's health check doctor.
The team of doctoral student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated an intelligent smartphone-based biosensor on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
You only need to exhale gently, and this set of equipment can preliminarily detect your physical health condition from the gas components you exhale.
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions in the market generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of body health.
Intelligent surgical lamp: the high-energy eyes of doctors.
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also being used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up a new approach to the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
Many diseases are not detected and removed early enough due to issues with the lights used in the operating room by doctors.
Shen Junfei said that, for example, during early cancer screening, if doctors cannot timely identify all tumor tissues, then cancer cells may continue to spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated with the Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated with the Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by simply rinsing them with water, at most using a little soap and squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and his classmates have invented a set of "air hand washing devices".
As long as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean!
Colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue testing have proven that the effectiveness of washing hands using this method is the same as using regular hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange to make up for it as soon as possible and give it back to me, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund in cash, do not give points, and I will not use #PRS_ORG# in the future!

He asked me to tell you his current location #PRS_ORG#.
I'm not waiting anymore, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Cancel the order.
Okay, thank you.
A certificate that is considered very meaningful - a first aid certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have, besides my driver's license!
Just to clarify: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken when a sudden event occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency aid is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or sudden respiratory failure, then our window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's really important to have people around who know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there foolishly and being unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
In China, our official data shows that three million people die from accidental causes every year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved nationwide.
"In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%."
This was said by Lu Le, the founder of First Response.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing or heartbeat, pressing the acupoint in the middle of their body will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to have a chance of saving a person's life.
I found that there are still very few people who have the awareness to learn first aid now, but it will be too late when things happen, so I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save someone's life!
You can register for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students can even get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before turning 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the list was done a few months ago, but it was indeed accomplished!
Next, I plan to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I have ordered ##NUMBER##.
There's only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan?!
Never tried.
Why can't #NAME# write it clearly?
Does it cost 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed delivering some food, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat?!
Because clearly I saw that the code I entered earlier was valid.
Firstly, to state my conclusion, I personally believe that "Four Seas" is a completely terrible movie in every sense.
But if you ask whether this movie has any highlights, well, at least the music selection is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies, one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is one type, and one that makes you angry after watching it is another type. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from the K-serial novels, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
After watching it, you may even doubt whether there are any hidden metaphors implied by the director, but upon careful consideration, you will find that it is actually a piece of crap.
First, let me briefly explain some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist's place of residence should be on a small island in the southern region, where he relies on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother's wish was to see snow, and the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her in a small van to Northeast China to see the snow.
Did the elderly person take a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are still very reassured about this.
Then the old man didn't say anything more.
How did the brother of the female protagonist obtain a business license to operate a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gang of street racers on the island easily block off a section of mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the roadside, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
Isn't this prop too obvious?
Why would a small-time thug who has a bad credit record and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't you report the high-interest loan? In the movie, the police even asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room key to open the door in a hotel, ended up forcefully arranging to find the hotel owner and slept outside the room for a night.
This inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and because the plot is so absurd that even recalling it causes me pain.
Apart from the plot, the worst thing about the movie is its theme, or rather, the fact that the movie has no theme at all, it's just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you might think that he wants to make a comedy, but after more than 20 minutes, you might guess that it could be an inspirational film. When you're halfway through, you might think it's a drama that reflects the difficulties of young people in small towns. After watching it, you have no idea what you just watched, and you start to deeply doubt yourself. Why did you go to the cinema to enjoy watching poop during the New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, then it should be inspirational and comedic, and tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success.
If you want to make a love movie, then you should honestly tell the story of the love and hate between a young man who likes to ride motorcycles in a small town and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot cannot include things that contradict the normal world.
For example, the character played by Yin Zheng, who can still sing after his new motorcycle was burned, cannot go and explore some mind-boggling ideas that even Kennedy couldn't handle.
As for the female lead, although she is clearly not intellectually disabled, she sometimes behaves like a 5-year-old child in certain aspects. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There's one thing I can't quite understand - why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival season to cause trouble for the audience?

Introduction of Zhengzhou well brick module equipment for the production and processing of concrete modules for inspection wells.
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, and well wall module machinery, with production lines ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated.
After years of practice and development, we now have high-quality equipment and supporting devices for the production of hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated inspection well series.
Inspection of concrete module production and processing equipment for manhole covers. Assembly site for Zhengzhou manhole brick module equipment.
Features and advantages of Zhengzhou well brick module equipment for the production and processing of concrete modules for inspection wells.
Yixin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely applicable to new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas, etc.
For example, various inspection wells, rainwater inlets, square gutters, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have concave and convex grooves on all four sides, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the well wall structure is far superior to that of the flat friction masonry construction.
The module is a hollow structure, with longitudinal holes connecting after being assembled, and transverse holes intersecting. After the holes are filled with concrete, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role in secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Both the horizontal and vertical modules are equipped with rib slots, which correspondingly increase the overall structural strength by adding horizontal and vertical reinforcement bars.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are not easily prone to collapse, sinking, leakage, and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output devices, one-key touch screen LCD display monitoring of the entire mechanical operation process, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The well wall module mechanical hydraulic system adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of the main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system operation.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment material box travels forward and the mold box rises, the material storage box door closes, and the automatic conveying pallet is all independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer and electrical components, sealed hydraulic components, and is equipped with reliable and stable comprehensive performance.
The mechanical vibration platform for well wall module uses integral plate steel, with no welding points on the table line cutting and molding, allowing the filling box to swing freely and reducing mechanical wear.
Reduce the load on the mold, combine the filling and compacting amplitudes, adopt integrated and fully synchronized vibration for both the table and the mold to ensure a solid vibration effect.
The wall module mechanical vibration machine for well wall body is controlled by computer to adjust the amplitude according to the cost-effectiveness of raw materials, without wear and tear braking, thus extending the service life and reducing costs.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Vocational School is piloting a modern apprenticeship system, where enrollment means becoming a qualified employee of the enterprise. - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, it was learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship system" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive pilot training will also have apprentice status, and after enrollment, they will be pre-registered as employees of pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires standardized enrollment and employment procedures for vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identity of vocational school students and prospective employees as apprentices. Following the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises must sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but under 18 years old, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and collaborate with partner companies to provide pre-employment training and job transition training for their employees.
The pilot schools need to reform their talent cultivation mode.
The school and enterprise jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
As a pilot project, the cultivation of the academic system is carried out in a pilot cycle, and the students' internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, with a general on-the-job internship period of 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotation position proficiently.
According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has designated 60 modern apprenticeship pilot programs for vocational education at the municipal level in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot program, training a total of around 3,000 students (apprentices).
Following the principle of piloting before promoting, gradually advancing from point to area, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improving students' job skills, and increasing their employment rate and quality.

South African doctors: Although Omicron has strong transmission ability, it is mostly mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, even though it spreads more quickly.
According to a report by the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs, similar to flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but so far, no patients have needed to be hospitalized.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more susceptible to severe illness from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta epidemic, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, in recent weeks, only 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have had severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of the previous wave of the pandemic. The average hospital stay has decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, compared to a death rate of 20% in cases from the early stages of the outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early, we need to obtain data from the later stages."
"Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the main strain of the coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the new cases discovered in the first week of December in Hauden Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omicron variant accounted for over 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education Review: What is needed to rescue abducted children?
If we use the famous public service advertising slogan "No trade, no killing", then in a good environment without the demand for "child abduction and trafficking", community prevention and control, and nationwide anti-abduction efforts can make abduction and trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky, and costly, and this type of crime will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Abduction Investigation Office of the Ministry of Public Security has launched an emergency release platform for missing children's information.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Upon hearing that this app is called "Reunion," I suddenly felt a warm and cozy feeling.
The new technological methods not only have a poetic and emotional name, but also make appropriate use of information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of cracking down on child abduction and enforcing the law is to find and rescue the abducted children, and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, it is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed with many "big words".
Before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
In matters of importance and urgency, controversial topics such as whether child trafficking should be punished with the death penalty can be set aside for careful discussion, but rescuing abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after succeeding.
If the search for the kidnapper is delayed by one minute, the child may be one step further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase.
In this situation, taking out effective measures such as the "Reunion" platform that directly helps solve cases and recover missing children is indeed a practical action.
After all, "anti-human trafficking" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to operate well.
From the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement, the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak" is needed in all aspects of combating crime and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from both the family and society.
For example, a common case where a family of three rests at a train station, the parents fall asleep, and only wake up to realize their child is missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, we should at least have a certain level of awareness of protection.
Both parents taking turns to rest and placing the child under secure protection are the minimum measures to prevent children from being abducted.
From the perspective of cracking down on trafficking crimes by the police, the other side is that the buyers of abducted children should also be monitored and punished.
Individual illegal behavior is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed, and property may be confiscated.
With high starting point and heavy maximum penalty, in the trend of "lightening penalties", the crime of trafficking in children is obviously a more severe punishment.
Even today, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking occurring every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak awareness of the law.
Legal education for this group of people should be synchronized and kept up-to-date.
To effectively control human trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the widespread existence of the "market" for child abduction persists, the abductors, driven by greed, will constantly innovate their methods and create a "battle" situation with law enforcement, causing anti-abduction efforts to inevitably become mired in inefficiency.
Therefore, eliminating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to eradicate crimes of child trafficking and buying.

Draw strength to advance from the Communist Party's century-long struggle.
On December 10th, Hunan Daily News (by Gong Baiwei, reporter for all media) reported that according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Haodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, gave an interactive lecture at the Malan Mountain Video Cultural and Creative Park on the morning of December 10th, deeply studying and implementing the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, studying and implementing the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and studying and implementing the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong, combining his personal insights and experiences, has deeply and comprehensively explained the core essence and practical requirements of the plenary session's spirit from three aspects: ideal beliefs and original aspirations, self-revolution and youth party, and party leadership and party theory.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the plenary session, the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on Hunan, and the spirit of the provincial Party Congress, learn and integrate them, enhance our ideological consciousness, political consciousness, and action consciousness of defending the "two establishments" and achieving the "two safeguards", and firmly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive communication session, grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishments," how cultural enterprises can grasp guidance, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the Party's century-long history. Yang Haodong answered each question in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly urged young party members to draw strength from the Party's century-long struggle history, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, and firmly follow the Party, using their youth to dedicate themselves to responsibility and commitment.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the delivery rider's mistake.
There is no document on the bag.
Cannot be traced.
I hope you can understand it.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than displayed.
That's all, thank you.
Yes, we have already changed the rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has been saying that it's still processing.
Waited for several hours.
The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two main categories, virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five different grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and filtering out impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil: is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin olive oil: slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary virgin olive oil: the taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity level not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity level exceeding 3.3%, also known as "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular olive oil: Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5% and it has a transparent light golden color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is obtained by dissolving and refining olive oil from pomace.
If you have looked at the classification of grades, you should have already discovered that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes used to make wine. Olives from different regions and different varieties will produce olive oil with different standards.
The best growing place for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation, for the growth of olive trees.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, in other regions, plants can only be sporadically grown in suitable habitats.
Main production area (Mediterranean region):
Countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and others, which have similar climates, also include Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on, which are far south of the equator.
Harvesting month for olive oil:
From March to June every year is the time when olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for harvesting fruits (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in abundant monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The democratic summit has come to an end, and Biden declared that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden, attended by government officials, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
In his closing speech, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the heart of every person in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that there are plans to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs commissioner Tang Fenghe, as well as Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Kwun-chung, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before, as demonstrated by this summit, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"A totalitarian regime can never extinguish the small flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from the entire society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and better resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power nakedly before public interests."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day happens to be "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech that the democratic cause is facing challenges worldwide, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our common values and positions, as well as the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality issues, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech via pre-recorded video at the summit, reminding attendees to continue paying attention to the human rights situation of Chinese ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans, as well as Hong Kong.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been experiencing China's rise, but there has been no mechanism established to hold it accountable."
This is why politicians and leaders of civil society must cooperate.
"We must utilize everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority task."
Luo Guancong also called for the free world to unite and confront the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you have not realized the threat (the Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason why we failed.
"This is also the reason why we must change."
During the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Tang Feng, Executive Yuan Minister without Portfolio, released a video statement titled "National Declaration," emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience of fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "As democracy in Taiwan continues to flourish, we remain steadfast in standing at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments in various regions have rationalized the violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a global regression of democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without having to lock down the city, and we can overcome false information without having to take it down.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", while the schedule was ongoing, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and several other countries that were identified as serious human rights violators. At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
However, the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
So it turns out that it requires #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I won't call.
Not eating anymore.
I will definitely complain.
"If you can't deliver it, why didn't you say so earlier?"
Waited for you for so long.
No, I did not receive a call.
Please notify him to deliver it to our company again.
I don't want to wait for #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
One meal waited for an hour and a half.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not allow cancellation?
Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a practice partner with a similar price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often directly proportional to the level of friendliness. If you cannot distinguish, then the more expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheaper ones. These so-called "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low. When the ball hits the racket, there is a lot of vibration. The hard ball cannot be controlled, even by skilled players.
The logic and implication behind their existence is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won't be able to learn it and you won't want to spend a lot of money on it, so they sell you a cheap racket to fool you. You'll play with it a couple of times and then never play again, so this cheap racket won't make you feel bad.
When you can truly distinguish between good and bad, it means you have improved. Then come to me and buy the expensive ones, I will make double the money.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand, better quality racket, choosing either Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough to sell expensive rackets, so a new racket for 500-600 yuan is good enough. A second-hand one for 200 yuan is also a good option. Isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of owning a thousand-yuan racket at a lower cost?
It is quite friendly to beginners, but once they pass the beginner stage, it becomes mediocre. However, most people, especially girls, cannot get past the beginner stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Excuse me, can you help follow up on this?
Postpone.
Thank you.
So, actually, do I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Should I ignore the previous order?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing from the delivery and the mouth-watering chicken was also undercooked.
#PRS_ORG# said for no reason that I should pick up the item myself, please cancel it.
The order I placed requires delivery, there is absolutely no option for self-pickup.

I don't want food that was prepared an hour ago.
I have found the buyer of the incorrect order before.
But my pancake is missing.

In fact, there are many requirements for dressing and matching for girls who are slightly chubby.
Girls with a plump body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the area where the thighs are plump.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the obesity on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear clothes that are divided into three sections - upper, middle, and lower - it will make you appear naturally taller. For example, wearing different colors for the top, skirt, and long stockings will create a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a must-have for slightly overweight girls (the author deeply understands this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and a noble and elegant black short skirt is also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black skirt, will make people feel that you are a bit slimmer.
If your calves are fat, don't wear socks and shoes that attract too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
To avoid giving people the impression of obesity when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to talk about the tips for dressing well and matching clothes.
Plump girls should never wear tight short skirts, and their tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black long stockings or fishnet stockings (the small grid ones). Choose a soft printed flared skirt and pair it with a loose-necked top to cover up the shortcomings of plump girls.
Of course, there are also considerations for slightly chubby girls when wearing short skirts.
A chubby girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make her chubby figure appear taller.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs appear longer and slimmer, which is the most fashionable combination in summer!
If you are a girl with a chubby upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous short dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also showcase your strengths.
An A-line skirt can make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for chubby girls. The top should be more fitted to create a layered look that will make you look even slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even plus-size women can try it.
Slightly chubby girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing well, even slightly overweight girls can become the center of attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, we should also exercise more in life, striving to get rid of the label of slightly chubby girl as soon as possible. 😄

Xinhua All Media+ | Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Helps Ignite Winter Olympics Passion - Xinhua News Agency
On December 11th, Pang Yaotian (center), a player from the Beijing Dreaming ING team, took a shot during the game.
On that day, the 2021-2022 season Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued to compete in major ice rinks in Beijing.
This league is divided into regular season and playoffs, with athletes aged from U6 to U18 participating in two categories: competitive and selection. It attracted nearly 3,600 players from 256 representative teams in the city.
After more than ten years of development, the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has become a platform for young ice hockey enthusiasts in Beijing to improve their skills, make friends, and provide excellent players for the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Team and Youth Team.
The league plays a driving role in promoting youth ice hockey in Beijing, igniting enthusiasm for ice hockey in the Winter Olympics, and laying the foundation for the development of ice hockey in Beijing after the Winter Olympics.
"The girl acted as a target for her sister's fundraising event, thinking that it was just a flesh wound and it was okay." - Xinhua News Agency
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, which had the words "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' for her sister's fundraising" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board has the words "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it, indicating that passersby can pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot at it.
This behavior has sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xicheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move only to raise funds for her sister, but this behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was warned for soliciting donations on the street with an "arrow target".
In the picture circulating on the internet, a long-haired girl stands in a "person" shape in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. In front of her, another wooden board displays her bank account, WeChat, and Alipay account information.
The picture caused controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging behavior to attract attention", while many others express sympathy for it.
We discovered the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we were patrolling to the square, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time.
Police officers from the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls selling goods on the street, both around 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who acted as the "human target" was crying and asking passersby to play this game; another girl was shouting beside her, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, asking everyone to help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xicheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Beijing News that the girl's name is Jijiali and she is raising funds for her sister Jijia Yan.
However, as the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in expenses and they couldn't think of a good way to raise funds for a while, they resorted to this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls acted as a target while the other was responsible for assisting, but neither of them actually participated. No one was found shooting arrows during the entire process, only some people were watching and taking pictures that were posted on Weibo.
After the police department was appraised by the public security department, it was determined that the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The person in charge stated, "We do not advocate using this kind of sensational fundraising method."
After being warned by the police station, she has already left the police station.
Cooling effect: good, thinness: convenient, appearance and material: satisfactory. Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable, and there are no problems with the four air outlets for heat dissipation. It is worth recommending.
This Acer Predator Helios Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with solid workmanship and materials, and a trustworthy brand!
The price of Acer Predator Helios Dragon is not considered expensive.
Personally, I think the Acer Predator Helios 300 is really good. The game performance is smooth and can handle most games. My PUBG runs at a stable high frame rate and is very smooth. League of Legends is also no problem, and CS:GO is easy to handle. Most AAA games can be played.
Cooling performance: The cooling performance is good, the fan is powerful, it works quietly, and even with all game settings on, the fan is still not too loud.
Appearance material: The appearance is quite cool and stylish, which is inherent in gaming laptops. Display effect: The screen is very clear, and 1080 is enough for playing games.
Buying the notebook, I feel it's pretty good, especially for design work. It has a high cost-performance ratio, is lighter than I imagined, and looks better than I expected. The red on the back is a very attractive wine color, not too flashy. Overall, it exceeds my expectations and is worth buying. It's also suitable for girls.
I started using the Acer Dark Knight two years ago, and after using it for two years, I found that it has a high cost-performance ratio and excellent quality.
I also recommend my friends around me to purchase this product!
We have already purchased three machines from this series!
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also very good.
Bought it for my nephew, originally planned to wait for the 418 bank promotion, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost performance is quite high and the logistics is also quite fast. Let's come back to review it after using it for a while.
A brand new, high-performance and cost-effective gaming laptop with a great design style, already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought for children to use for 3D rendering, software has been installed, child says it can be used without any problems, this computer can perform well for 3D design work.
What I bought for my son, he said it's very good.
The computer is pretty good, especially the customer service attitude is very good. If you don't understand, just ask. I recommend buying it.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What is the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was a popular article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete in Olympic Events for Gold Medals" which mentioned that project managers are often the leaders in many projects, and no one can match them in terms of hard work, including working long hours, traveling frequently, and dealing with unexpected problems such as crisis management, taking responsibility, and apologizing.
A seemingly humorous and teasing article actually reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing their powerlessness in current project management work.
And personnel engaged in project management work are also gradually choosing to take some actions to get themselves out of the difficulties in their work.
From the increasing number of registrations for PMP (international certification for project management professionals) every year, it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "20-year Development Report of Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® exam takers in China was nearly 600,000, with approximately 420,000 people certified and around 300,000 people holding valid certificates, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificate holders worldwide.
In the past decade, the number of PMP certified individuals has been increasing year by year, indicating that more and more project managers realize that relying on simply copying past "old experiences" is no longer feasible. The rapidly changing work environment teaches us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the path forward.
However, does passing the PMP exam guarantee smooth and unobstructed project management work?
Many novice project managers express that by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major areas and five process groups of project management and other related knowledge points, but they still feel confused when actually carrying out project management work.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following issues: inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to put them into practice; lack of systematic project management processes and institutional support, inability to implement work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and project delays; unclear division of labor among team members, and "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond; poor communication and coordination across departments, making it difficult to advance projects...

Czech Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival saw the national online payment transaction amount reach 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
The diverse range of discounts and promotions, along with the eye-catching live streaming sales, once again made consumers shout out their benefits. On one hand, this consumption boom makes people marvel at the increasingly strong national purchasing power, but on the other hand, it also requires us to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", Jie Xin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jie Xin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and refuse blind and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, which is 2.04 higher than in 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy levels of both the elderly and young people are relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education. Nielsen's "Report on the Debt Status of Chinese Youth" and CCTV's "2019-2020 Report on Youth Consumption in China" show that the younger generation has enormous consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, which is quite different from the "excessive spending" label attached to them by the outside world, some young people do have excessive and follow-the-crowd consumption behaviors, which have led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even gradually increased social problems. Financial enterprises should take social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Cetelem has always been committed to providing high-quality and considerate services to help people build their own happy lives, advocating for consumers to establish good and correct consumption concepts, and actively responding to regulatory calls to promote rational consumption awareness among consumers, especially young people, through practical actions.
Over the past few years, Citi continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities targeting young people, including college students, and subtly guided their consumption demands through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan their consumption demands, and accumulate personal wealth for their life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct money concept, resist blind and excessive consumption, avoid consumption and borrowing misunderstandings, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead, act within one's means, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as buying a car or purchasing a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with more tailored and diversified services, continuously helping the public improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a lifelong trusted consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's News - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the region's countries.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in restoring relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to Qatar from both countries.
The resolution of the Gulf Arab countries' differences and the restoration of their relationship with Qatar is based on the requirement that they must unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, and is aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two neighboring Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains between the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' companies have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion in total.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and major world powers on the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Gulf Arab countries have condemned for its inability to address Iran's missile issues.
Each Gulf country has always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and sees Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Each Gulf country believes that it is flawed not to address the issue of Iran's missiles and not to take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of major countries' failure to meet the wishes of Gulf countries in nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran have engaged in direct talks.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of unity within the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing measures to ensure full cooperation among its member states in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It claims to have the loudest exhaust sound among supercars in the New Mountain District!
The car that our team is bringing to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, the annual road tax is tens of thousands of Malaysian Ringgit, it has four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, forget it, the data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that when my Myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car would have already reached 100km/h.
The low and sleek body, bold scissor doors, large air intakes all around the car, and the 6.5-liter V12 engine visible through the glass, perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
As for the explanation of the car models, there is no need to say too much. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be found through Google.
Being overly noticed, wherever I go, everyone is watching, it's very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool)
The cost of 1km of fuel is around RM1 (car owners don't care at all).
The posture of getting on and off the vehicle needs to be practiced, otherwise it may be a bit awkward (because you might crawl out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and after getting off the car, one's ears will instantly become deaf. (But it's still very cool.)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in a regular parking space. I'm afraid it will be hit when the car next to it opens its door!
Feeling a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (the editor said it themselves, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha).
Everyone, please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their cars, please contact us!
More car information that you don't know, is in The Car Guide / People's Car Journal.
Involving a car accident worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known among car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range!
Before that day, foreign countries had crashed million-dollar sports cars, including the 911 and the Chiron, in just a few minutes.
Looking at the results, it makes sense that it's expensive!
Let the spirit of universities resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency.
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that a university has accumulated and formed during its development process, and it is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities is crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which emerged in the midst of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the values of "enlightening morality and benefiting society, cultivating oneself and governing the country" and the patriotic responsibility of "strengthening the country through education".
Currently, the trends of informationization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly apparent, and global competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important aspect of the "supply side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially the proposal of the overall plan for promoting the construction of world-class universities and disciplines, not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination in advancing from a higher education power to a higher education powerhouse, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to become a world-class leader in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having confidence in their goals, path, and abilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages: first, the advantage of being a latecomer, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the advantage of culture, inheriting the wisdom and connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, in order to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the advantage of the system, leveraging the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven efforts, gathering consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for universities to accelerate their catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be achieved by following a one-size-fits-all approach. While each school must leverage its strengths, it must also demonstrate its own personality and characteristics.
The characteristics of education should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, educational traditions, and resource endowments.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of our education: first, emphasizing the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment that combines science and education and integrates school-enterprise cooperation, and forming a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, emphasizing the convergence of disciplines, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, creating a system environment for interdisciplinary studies, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; third, emphasizing the characteristics of our education system and social services, conducting in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, and to let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seeking Truth and Pursuing Innovation," the shared values of "Diligence, Morality, Discernment, and Pragmatism," and the shared vision of "Embracing Diversity, Cultivating Virtue, Advancing Knowledge, and Serving the Country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It is rich in content and has profound significance.
Among them, "Embracing the Rivers and Seas" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the attitude of "using talents from all over the world", and reflects the high-quality educational concepts of world-renowned universities. "Seeking Truth and Pursuing Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and pursuing excellence, which means that universities should not only pursue truth, but also cultivate morality and personality. "Innovating for the People" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge and scientific research, as well as reform, development, and innovation. "Serving Our Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and emphasizes that universities should always share the same fate with the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is exactly the soul of the 120-year history of Zhejiang University.
"The wise listen to silence and see the unseen."
Chinese universities should further establish themselves in the overall framework of China's socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission and era orientation of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, the spirit of the university is stimulated by the spirit of the times and the national spirit, providing inexhaustible power for achieving national prosperity and rejuvenation, and realizing the common ideals of humanity.

Iranian President: If sanctions against Iran are lifted, there is hope for reaching a nuclear agreement - Xinhua News.
TEHRAN, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in the capital Tehran on Dec. 11 that if the United States lifts sanctions against Iran, a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue can be reached with a "good agreement."

At the time when NFTs were rapidly gaining popularity, a new concept emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn stable income through this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, incorporating various gameplay including NFT, and is currently the highest-grossing NFT project with a transaction volume of over 3 billion US dollars as of now.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, approaching that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will spread a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just a single role. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
After reading a news article about a friend's stock price, my biggest realization is that when choosing a path for a company, which refers to the selection of investment targets, one must first choose an industry with a large growth potential, with a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, one must choose an industry with good future growth prospects, considering industries that will reach their optimal growth state in the next 3-5 years; finally, one must choose an industry with government support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right", which means doing things correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which means doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics are about implementation. There is room for strategic thinking above most tactical considerations.
For example, when it comes to increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to deepen their current field or expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); when it comes to improving customer retention rates (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rates of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); when it comes to increasing participation in activities (tactical thinking), one can consider setting the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; when it comes to increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years since its creation, Bitcoin has encountered several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as a legal tender, making it the first country or region to do so.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' proposal to launch a Bitcoin ETF, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and expanding the exposure to cryptocurrency investments in the US capital market.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

"Asian-American groups complain of discrimination in admissions at Yale and three other Ivy League schools - Xinhua News Agency."
Washington, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process at three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of prestigious American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian American applicants in their admissions process through so-called "holistic review" that emphasizes long-term and systematic discrimination.
Zhao Yukong introduced that in 2014, research by scholars such as Sanders showed that among all ethnic groups, Asians had the lowest admission rate relative to the number of applicants at these three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian American applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting an appeal, the US Department of Education and Department of Justice can conduct an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the complained universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American group from the United States, the education groups participating in the appeal also include Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American groups.
"I need tableware."
Just cancelled the order.
Why is it still in progress?
Can you help me check if it has been cancelled?
But I already placed the order at 5:09 in the morning.
That is the food ordering hotline over there, they don't know anything no matter what they say.
Is there a phone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate agency about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu purchased a factory building and, after negotiating with Lin, a family member of the property owner, he transferred a deposit of 200,000 yuan through a bank transfer on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt for Deposit of Factory Sale", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will belong to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and both parties agree to sign the factory sale contract within one week."
However, afterwards both parties were unable to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory building for sale and payment methods, which led to a delay in signing the house purchase and sale contract.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After finally finding a house he liked, Mr. Lu paid the deposit and prepared the payment for the house, but just as he was about to sign the contract, the seller backed out, leaving him feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure to sign a formal contract could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed as a failure of negotiation. Therefore, the penalty for earnest money should not apply in this case, and the defendant should not be held liable for double refund of the earnest money.
After the first trial verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind you to exercise necessary due diligence during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, one should fulfill the necessary duty of care, such as verifying information about the property owner and whether the property is occupied, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on Saturday (December 11th) saying that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and toolifying democracy, using the name of democracy to carry out anti-democratic actions, inciting division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic reform', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was conducted via video, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, stating that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also doubts internationally and domestically in the United States, for example, criticism of inviting leaders with authoritarian tendencies to attend, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration in organizing this summit is not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit.
The statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday stated that "today's American-style democracy is showing its pathological symptoms, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth inequality becoming increasingly severe," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a foundation of capital.
US President Biden stated in his speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "as global democracy and human rights face ongoing and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has promised to launch a one-year action plan after this democratic summit, which includes an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support for independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he might have sent the wrong address.
Ri Chang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Peppermint] Environment: Average [Service Bell] Service: Dishes are served quickly. "Traditional Ma La Gao" is a must-try dish for me. Ma La Gao is too fragrant, soft, and delicious 😋. If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish and Tofu Hotpot". The soup is very delicious, the tofu is very tender, and the cuttlefish...
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the service is enthusiastic.
It's been a long time since I last came to Richang, the fruit mix is still so delicious and made with quality ingredients. The first time I ordered the char siu bao, it had the soft and fluffy texture of Southern-style flour that I love!
The claypot rice was cooked to the perfect level of dryness and wetness, the portion was very generous, the signature tin foil chicken wings were as good as ever, the soup was also good, and the Chinese broccoli was prepared quite well...
The taste is great, the service is enthusiastic, and the meat is good.
"Ri Chang Old Shop was also a popular internet sensation many years ago, located in a small building in Dongdan with wooden floors."
The clay pot rice that always requires a long wait at the entrance, the clay pots used for the rice have all cracked...
I haven't been to Ri Chang for several years. The rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a seat as soon as you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is excellent, as always.
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the staple food is also great.
"Ri Chang takeout."
[Rice] meal: The dishes this time were a little disappointing.
Three-cup chicken: there are a bit too many side dishes, and the chicken meat is slightly lacking.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness. You can imagine the combination of sweet and various spices as the seasoning.
What is the proper way to drink Red Label whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course, some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskeys in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at an international liquor competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, wouldn't it be a waste of its richness and aroma?
So how do you drink red label whiskey?
Let me briefly introduce it to you.
Red label whiskey drinking method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 different Scottish whiskies, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky, with a strong and sweet smoky flavor.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a slight taste of herbs and strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be directly consumed with ice or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Label whiskey has entered the domestic market, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey mixed with cola, Sprite, or other carbonated beverages such as Xinqishi has become a long-lasting fashion trend.
These sweet drinks not only help to neutralize sourness, but also bring visual pleasure, and when added to a beverage, they have the effect of diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the mouthfeel.
Red label whiskey with sliced lemon and sugar cubes (or granulated sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic Hongfangwei has a slightly sour taste, which can be neutralized by adding sugar. Lemon can bring a fresh aroma to the wine, and of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three methods are the best ways to drink red label whiskey. Everyone can try them as a reference, and I hope my introduction can help you.
Educational Thinking: How to Make "Top Students" and "Underachievers" Get What They Deserve in College Exams - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the exam format, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual abilities.
Indeed, for a long time, college entrance exams have been a "hot topic".
On university campuses, students come from all over the world with varying levels of abilities and different degrees of academic achievement, resulting in a wide range of learning situations.
It is inevitable to have different feelings when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions have a single type, high repetition rate, and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass by cramming before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a strange phenomenon where "learning losers" can pass or even get high scores without putting in much effort, while "learning elites" who never skip classes, have good homework and notes, and don't score much higher on exams.
In this way, it seems that the problems reflected by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University in the university exams are not unfounded, and I believe that this situation is not only present at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs up to the three students who wrote the letter straightforwardly.
In fact, people who have attended college are aware that the phenomenon of cramming for exams, trying various ways to obtain exam questions from teachers, striving to define the scope of the exam, and seeking "key coaching" before the exam is not uncommon, and even the situation of cheating during the exam and asking teachers for leniency after the exam is not unheard of.
In the author's opinion, as a guide for evaluating teaching quality, the measure of whether a university exam is qualified or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to specialize, and many courses focus on fundamental knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what the university exam will test.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is mostly subject-based theoretical foundations and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is mostly fixed.
As a teacher once said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned in university 20 years ago is still being studied today and remains important."
However, the fact that the knowledge points remain basically unchanged does not mean that the exam questions are singular or that the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually composed by a team of question setters, and then the test papers are organized by senior subject teachers. The grading of exams is also participated by all teachers who teach that subject, which can to some extent overcome the problem of repeated exam questions.
However, in order to formulate a set of test questions that are in line with the practicalities of teaching and learning, the questions should be distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, with difficulty levels following a normal distribution. Additionally, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and analyze the students' learning level, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of exam questions. This approach can highlight the testing of basic knowledge while also taking into account the examination of abilities, and at the same time, innovatively design the types of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education. Depending on the type of exam, students will have corresponding study plans. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students' recommendation letters and has already deployed a plan for rectification throughout the entire university.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to conduct discussions and self-checks on course completion exams, formulate exam paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen supervision and inspection of the exam paper proposition and review process, refine the score assessment, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
The issue that university exam management needs to face is to solve the problems of single question type and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the key lies in daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of teaching situations, not only mastering the teaching content, but also understanding the students' learning situations. By understanding both ends, teaching and learning can be better connected, forming a positive interaction. Exams will also be more practical, allowing "top students" and "struggling students" to each get what they deserve.
If it's not possible to change the location of the branch for me, can it be changed to delivery instead?
So I don't have to give you more money again, right?
My colleague's orders have already been delivered.
I cannot complete it.
What about GPS? Did we arrive or not?
The Madame Jin Bridal Photography (Nanjie branch) currently does not have any other branches.
Before taking the photo, because we didn't schedule our time well, we changed the time twice, and consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Jin's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time in my life that I put on makeup formally. Wow~ I can hardly believe that one day I will become so good-looking, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) have great patience when doing makeup, and their makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiangwan City. Luckily, the weather was very good that day and we didn't feel very cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist kept an eye on our clothes and accessories, and immediately helped us tidy up if anything was slightly out of place.
The photographer is also very humorous, and feels very happy after taking photos all day.
When selecting photos, because I saw many examples online, I didn't want to let the clients delete too many photos. However, when we were selecting photos, we didn't have any intention of adding more photos. We just chose the 24 photos included in the package, without adding any more (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, added over 10,000 photos to her package that cost over 7,000 yuan. I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many photos).
Today the photos were fixed, Lanlan sent them to me, and I found two that were not very good. They immediately helped me to fix them again.
Comparing the photos my sister took before with ours, I feel really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, exactly the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Fu Ren to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan.
Madame Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and success in your future endeavors!
How much does this set cost?
What conditions must be met in order to use that $32?
That's good, no need for a refund anymore.
Your rider says he can't find it.
Cannot find.
But I can't understand the English he is speaking.

3200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of specially-made anti-counterfeit paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeit paper inventory, birth certificates have not been issued to newborn babies since early October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kailu Aminus, assures that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued once the security paper arrives next week.
He explained at a press conference in response to a report by an online media outlet that Sabah newspapers had been printing on recycled paper for up to 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that a Chinese manufacturer producing special anti-counterfeiting paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed delivery to our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used for Sabah birth certificates is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from the inventory of other states.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and immediately proceed to the final stage of printing upon returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20th) to deliver to the applicant's hands.
"We will notify applicants to go to various local branches to collect their birth certificates."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
"From a little after 7 o'clock until now."
Does that mean it's almost here?
I mean food.
I am waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again.
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant said it's ready.
People's Daily commentator: "The 14th Five-Year Plan" has achieved a good start - On studying and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th: People's Daily commentator article on December 12th: "A Good Start for the 14th Five-Year Plan" - On Learning and Implementing the Spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference.
"The good start of the '14th Five-Year Plan' has been achieved." The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly praised the achievements of China's economic and social development over the past year.
General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the meeting, which deeply summarized the economic work of 2021, analyzed the current economic situation in depth, made major deployments for the economic work of 2022, and provided fundamental guidance for us to do a good job in next year's economic work and welcome the successful convening of the 20th National Congress of the Party, pointing out the direction forward and providing fundamental guidance.
We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, officially announce the comprehensive completion of a moderately prosperous society and the achievement of the first centenary goal, and embark on a new journey towards the second centenary goal of building a socialist modernized country comprehensively.
We held the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, summarizing the significant achievements and historical experiences of the Party's century-long struggle, and passing the third historical resolution in the Party's century-long history, "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Significant Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Century-long Struggle". This is a political declaration for the Communist Party of China in the new era to remember its original mission, adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a guide for action to learn from history, create the future, and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the world has experienced unprecedented changes and the global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact, making the external environment increasingly complex and severe. At the same time, the tasks of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic and promoting economic and social development domestically have been extremely arduous.
The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core adheres to the overall national and international situation, adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, calmly responds to the centenary changes and the century pandemic, coordinates epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, accelerates the construction of a new development pattern, strengthens macroeconomic policy regulation across cycles, focuses on promoting sustained and healthy economic development, focuses on deepening reform, opening up and innovation, and strives to complete the arduous tasks of reform and development, achieving new significant achievements in various undertakings of the Party and the country.
The "14th Five-Year Plan" has achieved a good start, and one important aspect is reflected in the new progress made in building a new development pattern and achieving new results in high-quality development.
Our country's economy has maintained a leading position in the world in terms of development and epidemic prevention and control, with strong resilience, great potential, and sufficient momentum continuously demonstrated. The national strategic scientific and technological strength is accelerating and growing, with major innovative achievements emerging one after another, and the ability for scientific and technological innovation continuously improving, achieving new breakthroughs in key core technology research and development. The industrial chain has been strengthened, with an increase in the quality and quantity of foreign trade, and the structure continuing to optimize, with new growth drivers represented by new industries, new formats, and new models. Reform and opening up are advancing towards greater depth, focusing on breaking through the bottlenecks that restrict supply and demand adaptation and factor flow, and creating new advantages for cooperation and competition through high-level opening up. Livelihood security is effective, with continuous expansion of employment scale, and residents' income growth basically synchronized with economic growth. The annual grain output has been maintained at over 1.3 trillion kilograms for seven consecutive years, achieving a record-breaking harvest. The construction of ecological civilization continues to advance, with coordinated efforts to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, a steady pace of green and low-carbon transformation, and new achievements in ecological environment protection.
The achievement of these results is the outcome of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the concerted efforts and hard work of the entire Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the country.
Practice has once again proven that the Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the entire Party, and has established the guiding position of Xi Jinping's socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics for the new era. This has decisive significance for the development of the Party and the country in the new era, and for advancing the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the entire party, with Xi Jinping's scientific guidance on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and with the unity and tenacious struggle of the entire party and people of all ethnic groups across the country, we will surely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, and create new era brilliance and forge new historical achievements in the new journey of building a socialist modernization country comprehensively.
Next year, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held, which is a major event in the political life of the Party and the country.
Promote the great spirit of the founding of the Party, adhere to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, comprehensively deepen reform and opening up, adhere to innovation-driven development, promote high-quality development, adhere to the supply-side structural reform as the main line, coordinate epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, coordinate development and security, continue to do a good job in the "six stabilities" and "six guarantees" work, continuously improve people's livelihood, focus on stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, maintain the economic operation within a reasonable range, maintain social stability, and we will definitely be able to maintain a stable and healthy economic environment, a safe and stable social environment, and a clean and upright political environment, and welcome the 20th National Congress of the Party with outstanding achievements.
Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, enhance the "Four Consciousnesses", strengthen the "Four Confidences", and uphold the "Two Maintenances". We must continuously improve our political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution, and implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee with practical actions, and continuously advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Then I will use my points to place a new order, thank you.

Super convenient, just like opening it on a computer, it solved my problem of insufficient hard drive space on my computer.
The brand new solid-state mobile hard drive that just arrived today cannot be read or recognized by the computer, but it can be read by a computer using a USB drive.
The machine is easy to handle, and has a stylish and attractive appearance.
Today I used it for the whole afternoon, the heat dissipation is very good, and I basically don't feel hot. The running speed is very fast, and it can boot faster than 99% of users.
The battery is also very strong, with a standby time of 9 hours and 4 hours of use should not be a problem. In short, I feel very happy to be able to buy a machine of this quality at this price. Other functions will be added later if discovered.
The appearance is very good.
In terms of performance, evaluate it again after using it for a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than imagined, and the rendered effect is great. I like it. I will give a more detailed review after using it for a while.
Not bad, not bad. The serial number of the machine can be found on the Hong Kong website, so the quality should be okay.
The feeling is not about size, but weight. It's not actually that big that one hand can't hold it, just a little bigger than 15.6 inches. It runs very stable and there is no lag. I love the sound of the fan cooling it down, it feels great, and it doesn't keep spinning like a gaming laptop.
The item is good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they even gave me a backpack. I think it's pretty good.
The shop's service is also good, reminding me to update the BIOS and promptly issuing a receipt.
Worth it!
Cooling performance: The cooling is very good, with almost no heat. Portability: It is easy to carry. Appearance and material: It has the traditional Thinkpad design, which is satisfying.
A reputable seller carefully inspects the appearance and all interfaces of the entire machine, with no traces of refurbishment or prior use. It is indeed a brand new American version machine with the same configuration as advertised on the webpage.
Forgot to send the backpack, immediately helped me send a backpack, although it is not the standard original factory backpack, but in terms of service follow-up, it is enough to prove that it is a conscientious seller.
If any friends need to buy a laptop, buy it again.
Appearance material: the appearance is atmospheric. Display effect: the screen resolution is good, clear. Thinness: it has a good texture, after all, heavier things feel better.
Cooling effect: Tried it out at the beginning, will evaluate it later.
Typing on the keyboard is pretty good, and it also comes with a mouse and converter. Compared to domestic products, this configuration is still very cost-effective. Overall, it's a good value for the price, but I'll wait to evaluate the machine's performance after using it for a while.
This screen is really comfortable!
The usage is very smooth, I will leave a follow-up review after using it for a while!
Education News: Beijing reduces the proportion of talented students admitted to junior high schools in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency.
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination for special talents in Beijing's junior high school enrollment will be organized and implemented by the education committees of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of special talent enrollment, making the competition for special talents more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, this year the proportion of special talents from primary schools entering junior high schools in the district should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan for the district. The planned enrollment is 380 students, and the enrollment ratio should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Students who have talents in sports, arts, and technology and have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent enrollment examination.
To facilitate students' participation in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement method from last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination centers are divided by examination areas, and the time periods are divided by hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination centers according to the time periods and take the examination in different examination areas.
On May 23rd, the district education enrollment examination center published online the list of students who passed the examination, and students can check their results online.
Can it be delivered within 10 to 15 minutes?
Did not receive food.
The key is that I haven't eaten dinner tonight.
If you can't deliver it, you can tell me earlier.

"48-hour negative nucleic acid test, set up a "buffer zone", the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News Agency."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring personnel who have recently left land border port cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold negative nucleic acid test certificates within 48 hours, and personnel arriving in land border port cities to undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region, and municipality determines the range of port cities and announces it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and there is frequent exchange of people between the two sides of the border.
Implementing differentiated management policies for different regions, transforming from one line of defense against external outbreaks to two lines, is expected to achieve the goal of moving the front line of defense forward, reducing the risk of epidemic outbreaks, and achieving the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some areas, inadequate closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, regular nucleic acid testing being just a formality, inadequate disinfection at various stages of cold chain items, non-standard management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficiently scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the filling of short boards and weak links in port city prevention and control, and to do a good job of prevention and control scientifically and accurately without any relaxation, and to weave a tight external defense input prevention line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize the work of epidemic prevention and control with the guarantee of people's livelihood, publish and keep open the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee, regularly investigate the potential risks in the supply and price of basic daily necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and banners) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (regions, states, and leagues) and municipalities where they are located, and the specific scope will be determined and promptly announced by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

"Youtube video exposes the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killings - Xinhua News Agency."
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on the YouTube platform titled "Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, and committing various crimes against humanity during the 20-year-long period of poverty and war, bloodthirstiness, and indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Abusing drones to launch air strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and forming murder groups.
For 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
One after another, inhumane crimes have aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "war on terror" is becoming more and more terrifying.
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, or hope to the Afghan people; it has only brought a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's expose the truth behind the United States' bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" and reveal the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
By chance, I came across the following article which discusses from a business perspective and a preservation period perspective why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to help with canning, even though canning is considered deep processing and not within the scope of the business of the bonded logistics company. This article may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many manufacturers of milk powder and have been in contact with many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the raw materials for powdered milk in bags and cans are exactly the same, with no difference.
So everyone will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or perhaps you may ask: why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged products?
Actually, many consumers, or moms, believe that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different from this point.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that expensive ones are better.
There are also consumers who, due to this mentality, claim that the taste or flavor of the canned food is different after eating it!
Now I will first explain to everyone the reason why canned food is expensive, what makes it expensive?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of bagged products is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low or even non-existent, so what can the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have had a significant increase in the pricing of canned goods to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote bottled packaging instead of bagged packaging.
And you, have you ever thought about how much money those manufacturers spend on advertising every year, ranging from tens of millions to even billions? Where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
As society develops, the promotion costs of the market, such as the promotion personnel in the mall, the display costs in the mall, the gift costs of the products, and advertising costs, are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is constantly adding new products, and they are all in the form of canned goods, with prices constantly rising. In fact, these are new products that have emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but in fact, the cost of their raw materials increasing will not exceed 3 to 4 yuan.
There is also a portion of brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary and collaborate with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, earning profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per listen.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operating methods, in fact, this kind of practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bagged milk powder and put it in a can with the premise of having a can at home. This can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on children.
Also, everyone should not think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned and bagged food is the same after opening, it is just that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late, and the food was cold. After it got cold, it became dry and hard, making it completely inedible.
Moreover, the soup spilled out.

Don't scare people away from the starting line - Xinhua News.
When strolling through the book market, one can often feel the popularity of success-oriented books.
Many of today's success books promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
It is like skipping over the most important and fundamental step of "how to achieve it".
As a result, these books all have a common feature - either do your best in one go or don't do anything at all; either it's 100 or it's 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay where you are.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely correct" by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a painful decision, transform yourself completely with a 180-degree turn," which happens to be a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who stick to old ways, follow traditions, and refuse to change, shouting "you need to change" in their ears is undoubtedly a futile and pointless act.
The vast majority of people will feel timid and hesitant when faced with the word "change", and find it difficult to make a decision; or they may impulsively make the decision to "change" and bravely take the first step, but often this does not last long and they give up soon after, making it difficult to sustain.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" vividly expresses this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "sigh at the sight of the door."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way that could lead more ordinary people to a relatively successful path.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories into big victories", that is, if you can't achieve 100, achieving 1 is also acceptable: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dune in front of your house is also acceptable, because it is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you have done something, it is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist, the probability of success will also increase.
Just following the "second best principle" to success, the journey is just slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" claims to promote success for everyone on the surface, it ultimately only motivates a few; whereas the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

The resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - According to the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to last year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002, it has increased more than 40 times.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as excessive hunting, deteriorating water environment caused by the breeding of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, by continuously increasing protection efforts through artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passage" measures, the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing bans in key water areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has established a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one lake, and one river".

I just saw an article about menstruation, it was too long.
Give a brief introduction to male science for those who don't know.
Most girls will experience their first menstrual period suddenly between the ages of 13-15, and will stop menstruating around the age of 50.
Assuming good health, it will come regularly once a month.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately, with a margin of error of about a week. It requires advance preparation, and sometimes unexpected changes (such as suddenly moving up by several days) can occur due to bad luck.
The duration of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain during menstruation vary from person to person. Some people have a period for three days, while others have it for a week. Some people have light bleeding, while others experience heavy bleeding. Some people have no reaction, while others experience such severe pain that they need to be taken away in an ambulance. The intensity of menstrual pain can change over time, and just because someone didn't experience pain in the past doesn't mean they won't experience it in the future.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and for several days from beginning to end, there is continuous bleeding for 24 hours. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to prevent the blood from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen quickly at the beginning of the menstrual period before the onset of dysmenorrhea can effectively alleviate the pain of the month. It is not effective to take it after the onset of dysmenorrhea.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine congestion and prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you experience unexplained diarrhea around your menstrual cycle, your period will likely come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case scenario is changing six times a day, which is 42 pads per month. If you add the prepared ones, there may be 50 pads, but not every month will use one.
Make a slight modification here: sanitary pads do not need to be changed frequently, they can be changed every five to six hours, and the longest time is eight hours.
Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation may cause irritability, and during ovulation, unstable emotions due to changes in hormones. It's unlucky that the body is tripping itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional issues as an excuse.
What flows is not just blood, but also includes shed uterine lining.
The endometrium is thinnest after menstruation, and then gradually thickens. This can be understood as the uterus being a house, building a house (thickening of the endometrium) every month to prepare for guests, but if the guests do not come, the house is demolished (menstruation), and a new house is built the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for several decades, bleeding for 24 hours a day for several days every month, and there may also be abdominal and back pain, who would be willing to endure it?
However, people are able to be born because their mother has had menstrual cycles. Menstruation is to prepare the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should be grateful for their mother's regular and healthy menstrual cycles.
In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, thinks that the female body's preparatory actions for nurturing life are disgusting, and should not be said in public, girls should stand up and stop thinking like this. Men who have never experienced it and do not understand it should not be ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude? How can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try using sanitary tampons, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, giving the wrong gift can be quite disappointing.
We need to order separate meals for the children to eat.
I hope that amidst the busy schedule, the store will still check the quality of their products.

With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from foot baths priced at over 100 yuan to those priced at thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a great deal of choice.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but foot baths do not have specific industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's really too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently he bought a foot bath tub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet when soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried using an electric pen and was surprised to find that it lit up. He then discovered that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for the long-popular foot bath tub in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and what materials ensure safety.
However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but there are also a few products that may not have been strictly checked during production.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-style foot bath.
Hydroelectric separation has no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can freely use the electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online.
On December 10th, Hunan Daily News (reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) reported that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center this morning, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of reaching a 100 billion yuan tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice Chairman of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand recommendation at the opening ceremony: the source of Hu Hong tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new vitality into the "colorful Hunan tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a 100 billion yuan tea industry in Hunan, and formed a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Rivers, and Five Colored Teas".
The tea industry within the province is increasing innovation, with main tea types such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to promote their products. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, which is driving an increase in income for tea farmers.
Fortunes change, and now red tea is gaining momentum.
Experts in the tea industry within the province claim that by harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers can have income throughout the year, and the output value of tea gardens will increase rapidly.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua was delighted to receive the "Origin of Hunan Red".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants were impressed by a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
"The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors may have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, there are many bright spots."
Xinhua black tea, with its unique red color, embodies the cultural connotations of tea, and has become popular and in high demand, ushering in a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "the Way is metaphysical, while things are physical" in the "Appended Remarks on the Sequence of the Book of Changes" in the Book of Changes, and was translated into "metaphysic" by the Japanese philosopher Tetsuro Watsuji during the Meiji period.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existing entities, and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
The method of naturalism refers to a research method that does not mention God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought in discussing the relationship between the mind and body.
Epistemology is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically reflects on and studies human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying ethical theories or criticizing their nature) and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and providing moral guidelines for correct or incorrect behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior guidelines people should follow, applies ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theories to practical life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and describes ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing it based on observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not start from theoretical expectations, but rather investigates the actual moral agents and their observed real choices, and considers all the moral factors that led to these decisions, and it discusses the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic ethical ideas represented by figures such as Valla and Montaigne.
Part 2: The ethical ideas of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British Empiricist ethics, represented by Hume, etc., 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British Utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Rickert, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies the principles and standards of valid inference and proof.
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, causal reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the essence and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To my friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided during the more than 30 years since our family tragedy, especially for the continuous assistance since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends both domestically and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the deceased victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and found jobs.
Your kind actions have helped us, these families in distress, to get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop donating to us, the Tiananmen Mothers group, as this humanitarian aid activity should have ended perfectly long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please understand, my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye said: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) engaged in humanitarian relief work.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-America Chinese Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and their project implementers often have cross-overs.

The rescue funds often cannot be delivered smoothly into the hands of the victims of the June Fourth incident.
In 1994, upon the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF subsequently established the "June 4th Elderly Poor Relief Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from donations made by individuals and society during the June Fourth incident, as well as generous contributions from individuals, and support from the Brother Universities Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, we have also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the victims of the June Fourth Incident finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June Fourth from Hong Kong.
During this period, "Chinese Human Rights" also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the donations for the June Fourth incident out of consideration for the donors. We are indeed a group of retired elderly people whose income is not as abundant as before retirement. Therefore, we express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the affected parties and terminate this project within two years, and immediately resume it if necessary.
For those fellow companions who have persistently and generously donated and risked delivering humanitarian aid for many years, we express our gratitude and respect.

"Time specimen photography currently does not have any branch stores."
Member evaluation.
[Effect] Photo effect: Took photos of two outfits. Overall, it's not bad. I quite like this set of pictures~
[Service] Service details: Because I felt a little uncomfortable while doing makeup due to pregnancy, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while on the side. They also kept pouring hot water for me to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the rabbit's comments. Originally, I thought rejecting the ancient style was not suitable for it, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dan Dan's recognition, your satisfaction can recharge us to move forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great, strongly recommend all buddies to come!
Everything from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and will match a suitable makeup style for you according to your preferences. The makeup products used are also top-notch brands.
As for Teacher Tian Liang, not to mention, photography is quite professional.
The entire studio has a strong artistic atmosphere, and there are also two little cats playing around.
We work in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing require a six-month advance reservation. Some of my colleagues have taken photos in Beijing, and after seeing the final results, I thought they were just okay.
I deliberately searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
"Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we feel that this is also a shortcoming for most people. Photographer Liang will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments."
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, an excellent team.
Everyone around us, including ourselves, can't stop praising the finished product.
I have already recommended my best friend to go, and she just watched the film and was equally delighted.
I hope that studios like this won't be buried and that more people will discover them, capturing their own unique style instead of conforming to the norm.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the work as long as the customer likes it. Thank you for meeting and knowing each other.
Sweet and considerate assistants, as well as lively and cheerful photography teachers, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, and I am very grateful to all of you. 😘😘
Thank you for your comments, Xiaoyu. It's fate that we met. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us has traveled thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you and hope to visit Qinhuangdao again next time.
How should I give the money?
The re-sent meal has already been delivered.
No rider is available to receive.
The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming novice who wants to share personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the money spent on training is very high, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline, training is an excellent choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
Firstly, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution will not have much meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before making a choice, inquire about the training institution. It is best to inquire about the students who have come out of this institution, after all, only the institution's students know how good or bad the teaching courses are.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't provided enough information about your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to one's personal circumstances.
For example, your major, age, desired language to learn, and even the city you are in, all have a relationship with the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have already graduated in computer science, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. There are many offline and online training institutions that are actually very good, but the cost of learning is high and the time investment is relatively high. Basically, it requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it's the situations I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available on the internet, or you can also find training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can contact me through my profile to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning costs and time, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning will not be too difficult, the teacher's explanations will be very detailed, and there will be someone dedicated to answering questions. In addition, it can also be helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements and have internal referral quotas. After learning, they recommend going to the company, which can save a lot of trouble in the job interview process.
The above are some of my opinions. The earlier ones were only briefly introduced because I don't know your situation well enough to provide detailed information. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I said to arrive before 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app.
"What does it mean?"
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various services including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall-mounted boilers, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, and professional caulking, as well as household services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me likes, working hard for a living is exhausting but we must continue.
Life will not let down anyone who puts in effort. If you like, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, we have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, besides being strong, we have no choice but to continue. The road can be looked back upon, but cannot be walked back upon.
Cleaning is a job and also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work as cleaners, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. When we see the satisfied smile and thumbs up from the customer, all the exhaustion is worth it. There will always be a reward for our efforts!
My daily work.
"Your request, my service."
Serve with heart, clean with heart, retain the beauty.
Fenggui Housekeeping has achieved the highest level of cleanliness possible in the details that you care about, and we are committed to providing a loving home service.
Keep your home clean, establish a household service monument, provide attentive service, and ensure cleanliness at home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily job.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will become dull and lose their luster if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly. Life is the same.
Only by putting in effort can we succeed, only by being meticulous can we create delicacy, and we are serious about beautiful seams.
Give me a chance, I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's not easy to work in any industry at present!
"But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance, and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!"
The plan for the day lies in the morning, and all the beauty starts from the morning. I hope you set off with happiness, luck, health, and good wishes to start a new day and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed and having it made us happy; as we grew up, happiness became a goal to achieve and achieving it made us happy; but as we matured, we realized that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding this brings us happiness.
Be the most genuine and kind version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; there are two treasures in life: good health and a good mood, live beautifully until old age!
At every stage of life, one will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not ability, but the courage to face things positively.
Since it's impossible to avoid, it's better to face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face challenges head-on, the problem will eventually be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia join hands to hold the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition - Xinhua News.
Riyadh, December 12th (Xinhua) - The first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on the 11th at the JAX Art District in Diriyah, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition. (Reported by Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan)
This biennial exhibition is jointly organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyu, the director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," "Inheriting as Experimentation," "Thinking on the Edge," "Moving towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, and some artists use recycled materials in innovative ways for their creations, such as Xu Bing, who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials in his "Endless Mountains and Rivers" series (2014).
Barclay, CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this year's biennial exhibition could establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction and exchange.
Tian Feiyu said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that during the opening period of the biennial exhibition, a series of lectures will also be held, where artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng): In order to continue to provide employment assistance to the impoverished population, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare positions in rural areas to promote rural revitalization and help promote comprehensive rural revitalization.
An official from the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used to provide employment for impoverished laborers and other rural disadvantaged groups. These jobs play an important role in helping impoverished people achieve employment and income growth, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify and regulate the scope of personnel recruitment for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level, fund management, position development, and position management.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations specify that the principle of "setting positions according to needs, determining personnel based on positions, dynamic management, and overall control of quantity", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, unified management" should be followed.
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, public announcement, hiring, pre-job training, and job assignment.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare positions, and require each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions to purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare positions; and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Although the rightists have had periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly with just a little bit of sunshine, and sweat with just a little bit of hot water. They quickly become greedy for more and are easily discouraged when faced with setbacks.
To be truthful, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in defining the standards of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting institutionalization of governance and protection of human rights.
As for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and also respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and political groups with mixed motives. Furthermore, foreign powers may take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to bring about change or improvement in China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Those who attempt political opportunism and seek personal gain are not right-wing, but rather scoundrels.
Let's talk more about the left.
Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, but the left does not have this opportunity because what the left wants is precisely what the Communist Party has discarded!
Recently, I have seen some friends arguing with anti-government protesters while refuting leftist extremism, and they seem quite passionate about it, but I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or extremists, they are stubborn and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the rebels and leftists to admit it. What's the point?
I tell my friends like this: When the rebels call you a "50-cent party" and the leftists call you a "right-wing dog", it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals or pursue their ideals and become paranoid.
As ideals gradually drift away, even the young dragon slayer may eventually become an evil dragon.
In my opinion, "left and right" generally refer to constraint and freedom. Due to China's innate cultural and historical genes, the country as a whole tends to lean towards the left.
The domestic right-wing emphasizes freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and focuses more on fairness and safety.
Currently, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the conflict between China and the United States means that a left-leaning stance is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
I won't say anything else, Huahua is just that righteous.
In the past two years, the US's blockade and containment of Huawei's chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "American" companies.
The United States is suppressing China's chip industry, demanding that its own companies and allied countries' related companies simultaneously block our country's chip industry, directly resulting in the impact on global chip suppliers' orders and profits, causing a decrease in research and development investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing companies, thus causing disruptions in the global chip supply chain due to shortages.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to major industries around the world, such as car manufacturers halting production and mobile phone prices increasing, almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", more and more technology giants in various countries are beginning to move towards the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly grasp the global semiconductor control, and to restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and providing financial support to American technology giants. For example, the American veteran technology giant Intel has invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, and has opened up its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why I am so certain is that Intel, as an old-tech giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large team of talents and technological reserves. It is certain that they will quickly rise and defeat TSMC in a short period of time.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement about Intel's move to build a wafer factory, saying without hesitation that it was ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because he still bears a grudge against the enmity between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the shining pearl in the American manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world and dominating the semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were always controlled by a small number of powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where a single factory completed the entire process of chip design, manufacturing, and testing. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has become unbearable for some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are deterred by the huge cost of building production lines.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there were specialized designers, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality and TSMC was born.
TSMC has targeted its main business on "wafer processing", without designing, only providing contract manufacturing services for wafer production.
At that time, the newly established TSMC was just a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only manufactures chips in the industry, they obviously had a high opinion of themselves and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel at that time looked down on wafer fabrication services.
Unexpectedly, the giant companies who used to look down on wafer manufacturing services are now starting to do wafer outsourcing themselves.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic for Intel to enter the wafer foundry business.
Nowadays, the market value of TSMC has surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally cannot remain complacent.
Now, TSMC has already sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
"Stop waiting."
It has been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅.
Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches".
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: "Dragon Raising its Head on the Second Day of the Second Lunar Month", "Hao Li You Price Increase", and "Huo La La Incident". Public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then the index decreases (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion arises, there will be a small camel hump appearing again.
They look exactly the same as the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in a "solitary peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff-like" pattern.
"Solitary peak" refers to artificially heating up and quickly climbing the hot search rankings, attracting public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff-like" refers to collective evacuation, after the hot search has served its "function", receiving a new mission and rushing to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat coincides exactly with the trough of another event, down to the second. It must be a coordinated group of fake accounts receiving orders to launch a new wave of attacks.
The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches simultaneously appear on the list, some attracting attention, some responsible for popular science, some inciting conflict, some diverting attention, some affecting cognition, some misleading judgment, some inciting emotions, and some influencing decisions. Black industry accounts are divided into batches and nodes for precise operations, considering almost all elements in public opinion dissemination and expansion.
Propagation is a science, and without any subjective factors such as position or emotion, only from objective data, black PR will also have nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we leave traces, and together we can uncover these traces.

Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first cases of Omicron variant infection - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th (Xinhua's foreign correspondents report): Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of COVID-19 variant Omicron infections.
Mauritius reported two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 for the first time on the 10th day.
According to the Minister of Health, Kailash Jagutpal, one infected person is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th from South Africa, while the other infected person is a local resident who tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of these two infected individuals have both turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th, the Ministry of Health in Cyprus announced the country's first confirmed cases of three individuals infected with the Omicron variant of the virus.
These three people are all students who returned from a trip abroad at the beginning of this month. As they all had mild symptoms, they did not require hospitalization.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government of Serbia is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, all passengers aged 12 and above who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival in Saipan.
On the 10th, the Serbian Ministry of Health also announced that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country has discovered three cases of the Omicron variant of the virus.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new positive samples of COVID-19 collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and discovered these three cases of infection.
The takeout has never been delivered.
Even the rider's phone number is fake.
I have already placed a new order.
Will the previous order be refunded?
If it's not possible, please cancel the order and refund.
Thinking of ordering food early so we can eat earlier, but it's already 7 o'clock and we haven't eaten yet.
I don't understand what you're saying...
Is your Chinese translated or do you prefer to use English?
That was sent to...
Do you need to call and tell him?

"Receiving is a money belly."
The order is for chicken feet.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain.
Your delivery person told me that the address is too far.
Damei 360 integrated home decoration.
Address: 12th floor, Xingfu Jiayuan, No. 156 Huancheng South Road.
At first, it was through a friend's introduction and because of trust that I chose to come and take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
As soon as they arrived at the store, a series of scams began.
This is my first time visiting the store, I only showed them my floor plan. They didn't actually measure the house on site, but surprisingly they were able to give me a quote saying that they could handle my 135 square meter house for 70,000 yuan. They showed me some of their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that once you go to the store, they will drag you into paying the deposit (and once you pay, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I hesitate about whether to pay the deposit or not, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you just pay the deposit today, we can give you how much discount.
This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. In a moment of impulsiveness, I paid a deposit of over ten thousand yuan.
The quote he gave me has many issues. It's 70,000 yuan excluding the cost of water and electricity renovation, and it doesn't include any doors, cabinets, or bathroom fixtures, which are the major expenses for basic installation.
Apart from this, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company because they made me sign a contract without explaining anything clearly at the beginning.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced and had a specialized team to deal with you.
No matter what, biting and killing is the customer's problem and they are completely not responsible.
There are various ways of shirking responsibility and many details that I don't want to go into one by one, it's all tears. In short, don't choose them because my friend had them decorate their house and the quality was poor, and they charged various fees later on.
"Damn it, they were the ones who used to deceive people with their dragon head decorations, now they changed to Da Mei, and it seems like they have gone bankrupt again and changed to something else."
So everyone, don't choose such a crappy renovation company.
In the future, when choosing, everyone should Baidu more and check these things and consult them, because decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
Prohibition of publishing any form of merchant reviews, please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.
Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of DAMEI 360 Integrated Home Decoration. For finding a decoration company, just go to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it's not delivered within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely hold you accountable.
I asked if it's possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes.
The spicy chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, so I couldn't eat it.
Starry Night Rendezvous | Gemini Meteor Shower to reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency.
Tianjin, December 12th (Xinhua) - Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year and one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by Beijing astronomer Anjiu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower that is not "nurtured" by a comet.
Shu Li-peng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy popularization, introduced that just like a blockbuster movie, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable characteristic of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroids move at a slower speed, have rich colors, and there are also many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and beginner astrophotography.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions when the radiant point is directly overhead) of 150 at its peak.
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower, known as "falling petals in profusion," left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by moonlight interference, which will slightly reduce its spectacular level.
On the 14th day of the lunar calendar, it is the 11th day of the 11th month, and the moon phase is a waxing gibbous moon. The bright moonlight may cause interference to observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them during the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but they should pay attention to keeping warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a broad view facing northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then patiently wait for the moon to set before observing with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a high flow rate in all directions, so when observing, there is no need to constantly stare at the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower.
Friends who enjoy photography and want to capture stunning "meteor shower masterpieces" should choose wide-angle lenses with large apertures, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Considering stability and continuity, a tripod, spare battery, and shutter release cable are also essential.
Xiu Lipeng reminded, saying.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the OP should be referring to LCD TVs, while the main differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs are primarily the following two points:
Firstly, laser TVs are more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TVs that are fully deployed, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or it can be said that laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs have been continuously increasing globally, accounting for over 60% of the overall sales of TVs with a size of 80 inches or above.
According to Zhong Yikang's prediction, the sales growth of laser televisions in 2020 will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain a high-speed growth.
The reason for such good performance in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, which is closer to the natural imaging process of objects compared to the backlight emission of LCD TVs, and also causes less stimulation to the eyes.
The Saixi Laboratory of the China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and ophthalmology experts from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital conducted a rigorous comparative test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions for the same group of people, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye protection characteristics and even have some improvement effects in specific areas.
In the current context where visual health is increasingly valued, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, currently available laser TVs on the market are mostly priced at over ten thousand yuan, and as the size and light source are upgraded, the prices gradually rise.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With the ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is relatively shorter than traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, requiring less space and having a small and compact host, occupying a small area.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition, with lower heat generation and less damage to the equipment, the lifespan of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, which can bring users a more stunning audiovisual experience.
It's not a matter of fake demand, but rather a product of segmented demand. In terms of picture quality and cost-effectiveness, laser TVs are not suitable for audiovisual enthusiasts who want to balance large screens and viewing environments. You can try it, but everything has its pros and cons. After weighing the options, make your own judgment, and don't just believe one side of the story.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle short-throw projector - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block some ambient light, a micro-structured Fresnel screen is used, which comes at a high cost. The price of an 80-inch screen can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
There's one more thing, I particularly dislike projection manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Come on, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light, regardless of whether it's reflected onto the ceiling or not. Even if you insist on comparing it to LCD TVs, it's still diffuse "direct light". When you turn on the TV, the ceiling is also illuminated, right?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it cannot become an image at all.
The thermal spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen was precisely overlooked, and when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, that is when it becomes truly uncomfortable.
The Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery's selected quality store currently does not have any branches.
After adding her on WeChat to make an appointment, the young lady sent me a list of available times to choose from, and her responses were quite prompt.
Before going, I looked at the photography works in the store, which were mostly outdoor wedding dresses and were beautifully shot, involving many different photography styles.
After arriving that day, I briefly communicated my ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was indecisive about, and finally we decided on the makeup and styling. Before the photographer started shooting, they would arrange some props and guide the poses, and they were also very meticulous about every detail.
However, maybe because they didn't communicate their specific shooting ideas with me, the style of the photos they took is not what I wanted, but they should still be beautiful. 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help select the pictures and discuss the post-production style. They seem quite attentive.
The repaired film will take about half a month, waiting for the effect~
The second time I won the photo category of the free meal event - most of the clothes in the entire venue could be chosen for a photoshoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting is my younger brother who was born in the 1995s. He seems a bit inexperienced, but I hope he can give more suggestions on guiding customers' shooting actions in the future. He is quite talkative, and the shooting process is relatively pleasant.
"Selected quality stores of Wen Photography Visual Aesthetics Gallery, reply."
It's on the homepage, come and take a look at Queenie too~
First, fill in your name and phone number at the store, then choose your clothing. You can choose any wedding dress, and the staff were patient when I changed into three or four outfits. After choosing, I spent a long time doing my makeup. The service was good, and during the shoot, they taught me how to pose. However, my face looked really big in the photos. They said it would take half a month to edit, but they sent them to me in three or four days, and they didn't seem much different from the original.
The overall environment is okay.
There are many optional clothes.
There are about three makeup stations, and inside is a photography studio.
The service is very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to suggest a reshoot.
The experience may have gone a bit too far, as the double eyelids were taped into triple eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows was also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don't usually draw their eyebrows.
The photos were given about ten days ago, but the photo editing effect is not very satisfactory, and the feeling is that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried two sets and ended up choosing a black dress after much deliberation. The saleswoman said this set had a more Hepburn vintage style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me, and the result was very satisfying.
After finishing my hair and makeup, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the entire process, making it a relaxed and harmonious experience.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites for retouching. The photographer said the finished product would be ready within 15 minutes, and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
It has been 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first and then pay my monthly fee after you finish your investigation? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyusan is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, three key requirements must be met: shareholders, initiators have no major violations in the past 3 years, a minimum registered capital of RMB 50 million is required, and approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission is necessary.
These three requirements are actually very strict. To summarize, a company must have strength, be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and have shareholders with good conduct. As a small umbrella insurance brokerage company, investors do not need to question whether it is legitimate or not, because not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyusan Insurance is like an insurance supermarket, where many companies' star critical illness insurance policies are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched HeTai Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance policy, with both the claims and underwriting parties being HeTai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, and its reliability should not be questioned.
From the perspective of payment methods, internet platform products generally have a higher cost-effectiveness because they have lower operating costs without physical branches and employee salaries. Additionally, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, which reduces the payment pressure on policyholders and maximizes the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
"Can consider."
From the perspective of the professionalism of salespeople, this is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires a very high level of professionalism. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings, especially in terms of health information and occupation. Non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or qualified, which can easily lead to many hidden risks in claims and the risk of being denied compensation.
I myself have worked as a telephone salesperson for insurance at "Tencent Weibao" (similar to Xiaoyusan, an internet insurance brokerage platform) and I can responsibly tell everyone.
Internet insurance is genuine and reliable, but it is the people who are unreliable. The internet channel lacks professional practitioners and there are also many sales misrepresentations.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance comes with a free phone, and receiving 60,000 critical illness coverage for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they focus on the trivial and neglect the important. They do not inform the insured that the first month is only 1 yuan, and the following months will be charged at normal rates ranging from tens to 200 yuan. Many customers are not clear about what they have bought after paying for one or two years.
Thought that by spending 1 yuan, the insurance company would compensate 6 million yuan (a pie falling from the sky).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if a winning message is sent, there is no reminder to redeem it.
"For the policyholder, this is another pitfall. Getting 60,000 yuan of critical illness coverage for free is only for a short period of time. If you rely solely on this and don't have any other commercial insurance, what can you do with 60,000 yuan if a serious illness really occurs? It won't solve the problem and you'll be left exposed in the future."
Currently, the country is also cracking down on misleading internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, the platform and products are not the problem, but rather the professionalism and ethical standards of the salespeople.
It is suggested that the topic owner carefully consider it comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. The cost-effectiveness of some products is also better than that of internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to purchase offline insurance products, saving each person an annual premium of 2000-3000 yuan.
If anyone has any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am Mingya, an insurance broker with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training. I have served nearly a thousand corporate clients and collaborated with over 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During the insurance process, I will compare and negotiate to get the best underwriting results for customers. After purchasing insurance, I will organize and manage policies for customers to ensure peace of mind.
Grow together with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business where the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance application link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the process of purchasing insurance online may lack a sense of ceremony and may not even involve printing a paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telephone sales", but purchasing insurance in this way may have a fatal problem, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we purchase insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even after many years?
How can I contact the delivery specialist?

Thank you for your help.
From the past until now, I have always opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate these villains.
If we don't consider political parties and factions, what we should resist first is this uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending me friend requests on Facebook, to posting sarcastic posts, and even trying to publish my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already adopted an unresponsive attitude.
Afterwards, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, fertility, and even some comments about whether or not to plant strawberries in bed or whether or not to insert something. I...forget it.
Later on, I received messages from even more friends about a photo of you uploaded on Facebook by one of your friends, along with comments containing sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported to the police, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your social status, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and abusive speech. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me. You can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make all kinds of aggressive remarks.
That's right, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure do not need your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself so much to become famous.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said it's good, but you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl could be bullied like that and still say that she's okay.
Only those who lack basic morality would choose to use this method to harm any woman, whether in work, society, politics, or business.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people.
I have selected some comments for everyone to review.
The post you made yourself should not be able to be impersonated by anyone, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
A knowing smile.
Vietnam People's Newspaper - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the third Vietnam National Forum on Digital Technology Enterprise Development.
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two main conferences were held to discuss topics related to the digital technology industry and the country's digital transformation, as well as the role of digital technology enterprises in the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery and development after the pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Meng Xiong, stated that despite the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in 2021, the number and revenue of Vietnam's digital technology companies continue to show growth, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products cultivated in Vietnam has increased, focusing on solving major challenges faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have also gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Mengxiong calls on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing the country's digital transformation platform, and taking on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on the national mission.
On the forum, leaders from various departments and government agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals who are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology, are sharing ideas and solutions for mobilizing and gathering resources from all sectors of society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, and working together to promote national digital transformation and breakthrough solutions for economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized during his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are for everyone, so it is necessary to mobilize everyone to participate.
The people and enterprises are the core, main body, target, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and businesses.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation needs to embody the national spirit, with internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term, and decisive factors, and external forces as important breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive deep and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, economic recovery and development, respond to changes afterwards, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and help green transformation and develop green energy.
The digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases that protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and other related aspects, and promote the digital transformation of fields such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country increasingly prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng has requested that governments at all levels, organizations, and enterprises increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to establish and improve systems related to digital transformation, strengthen national management, and actively promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Vietnam Manufacturing" Excellent Digital Product Award ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnam Manufacturing" digital product exhibition.
I have reported and also attached pictures, but there has been no response.
What cow? There's no cow.
It is saliva chicken, raw meat.
There's no way to eat.
Are you making sure it's freshly cooked food, not old?
unacceptable
I already placed the order early.
It was said that it would be delivered around 7 o'clock.
Why do we need to remake it?
It's outrageous.

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency.
Wuhan, December 11th (Xinhua) - The Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area to officially operate in the upstream of the Yangtze River, following the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan, which was put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and operated 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been recognized by a large number of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, significantly improving the capacity for receiving ship pollutants and shipping services.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides all-round production and living services for ships and crew members, helping them solve urgent and difficult problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been built and put into operation this time, integrate living services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as the features, achieving "one-stop service" for ships in the port. This will make the work and life of sailors who sail on the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and convenient.
"Three US aircraft carriers gather around China's periphery, and the most powerful weapon in the US Navy arsenal makes a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region. This latest news on US-China relations was reported by the pro-CCP media outlet Duowei on January 17, 2022, citing the latest satellite images."
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform," on January 9th, a satellite discovered the US aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the western Pacific.
The platform expects that the USS Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier transport aircraft on the USS Carl Vinson.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd, is also cruising in the Pacific Ocean.
The "Lincoln" also carried for the first time the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which belongs to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier stationed in Yokosuka, Japan in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the missile destroyer "Stockdale".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China, with their most powerful weapons making a rare visit to Guam.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, and the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US military carrier transport plane CMV-22B.
According to a Weibo account named "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness," CNN reported on January 17th that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Navy base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China's periphery, rare visit to Guam with their strongest weapons. Analysts say this sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China's periphery, and their most powerful weapons make a rare visit to Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the South China Sea.
The South China Sea Research Forum reported that the US Navy stated that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada" to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating America's ability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of 14 "Thundering Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Thunder Submarine" the most important survival weapon in the "nuclear triad" system, which also includes land-based ballistic missiles in the United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock price and the evaporation of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that they are facing unprecedented competition. What is the reason for this?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its main revenue coming from advertising. As a profitable advertising company, it has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, regardless of their functional positioning, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps connect to Meta's advertising, and monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
Firstly, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta finds it difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs Meta again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that contribute to its overseas business.
Meta has around a few hundred employees in their Hong Kong office and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, with most of the money spent on advertising going to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years, Meta has earned a lot of money from ByteDance.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and the performance of Meta's Greater China region is also very good.
Recently I haven't specifically looked into it, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies burning a large amount of money overseas has already passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT are no longer in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only values income, but more importantly, it looks at how future expectations are.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse".
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story may not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years are expected to be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success and annual revenue of 100 to 200 billion US dollars, the company actually feels a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet and high-tech companies, Facebook lacks a good and secure moat.
Although his several social apps have a relatively high daily active user count and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on, facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also lacks confidence, and the overturning may happen in the blink of an eye.
The concept of creating a metaverse is a distant and unattainable one, and there is no hope of success in the short term. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Mark Zuckerberg keeps changing the name of the company and constantly seeking new paths. However, I think his choice of path is wrong and it is a dead end. These are my thoughts for reference.

"The "Peaceful Rescue-2021" joint medical exercise between the Chinese and Vietnamese armies has successfully concluded - Xinhua News."
Hanoi, December 12th (Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhou Na and Teng Huaijin) On the morning of the 12th, all the Chinese participating troops in the "Peaceful Rescue-2021" joint medical exercise between China and Vietnam safely returned to Guangxi, China, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.
In this joint exercise, the Chinese and Vietnamese armies focused on the major issue of humanitarian medical rescue, closely adhering to the mission of providing medical care and saving lives. They completed joint medical command, joint on-site rescue, and mass casualty treatment according to combat standards, effectively enhancing the medical support capabilities of both armies.
The results of the exercise were affirmed by the armies of both China and Vietnam.
During the closing ceremony of the exercise, Nguyen Xiongsheng, Director of the Vietnamese Exercise Guidance Committee and Deputy Director and Chief of Staff of the Logistics Department of the Vietnamese People's Army, said that through this exercise, Vietnamese military doctors learned knowledge about exercise organization and professional activities from Chinese military doctors, and also witnessed the medical and support equipment of the Chinese side.
The results obtained from the exercise have demonstrated the professional capabilities of the two countries' military medical forces in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
Chen Chunming, the head of the coordinating group and deputy director of the Health Bureau of the Logistics Support Department of the Central Military Commission, stated that this exercise is another innovative practice based on the successful joint medical consultation activity held in 2018, and has a very important milestone significance.
During the exercise, the People's Liberation Army of China donated health and epidemic prevention materials such as medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, and rapid nucleic acid testing equipment to the People's Army of Vietnam.
