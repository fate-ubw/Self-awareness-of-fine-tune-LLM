Good day, sorry please, I didn't have internet and couldn't send it faster. Thank you.
Please tell me the exact address for tomorrow's cleaning, the code for the keys, and at what time tomorrow the guests will be checking out and new guests will be checking in.
Unfortunately, I have to decline your offer because I have already found a job during this time.
Sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes I feel that through a translator, my thoughts in Czech differ from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
However, please tell me if there is an earlier time?
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no other options, then I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people have once again taken to the streets for a protest, and the Russians did not have time to disperse them.
As the event participants told the agency, the residents of Kherson managed to hold a rally before Russian military with equipment arrived to disperse it.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now, one of the participants said, Russian equipment has arrived there."
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protest rallies at Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and Regional Council.
This square, as well as the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military are using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian aggressors also kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded the city of Kherson with the special title of "Hero City".
On February 24th, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launch systems, and ballistic missiles.
I often dream about my dad here.
He died on the day after my birthday.
Overall, dreams are good.
Hana, good day.
I did as you wrote and the phone started charging!
Very good news!
Thank you!
We can meet for an hour or two and then I will go home because I don't have the necessary things with me.
The janitor in a red jumpsuit is dragging a rocket to the trash can. No changes on the Kharkiv front.
It is possible to book a TV with a console and remote, pots, pillows, chairs, and frying pans.
Oleg also found me a part-time job - cleaning 2 apartments that are rented out to tourists on a daily basis.
Apartments are located in the center of Prague.
Would it be convenient for you to go to the bank with me on Monday? Or on another day?
Good day, it would be great if you could do it today as you wrote at 5:00 PM.
That's why I read the Bible, the Quran, and other books to find answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the accommodation that needs to be cleaned?
Do you mean having good dreams?
In addition to this report, I am sending you a list of job vacancies that employers are offering us.
If you are interested in the offer, please contact the contact directly in the advertisement.
I hope there will still be places here because our relatives, my uncle's wife, her parents and daughter, are also planning to come.
They have tickets for April 20th.
God grant that we arrive safely.
When you arrive, call me on the phone. The doorbell is not working.
It would be better if it were cheaper... we are forced to move because we can't afford European prices.
I need to look at the spots and try to see where it hurts.
He wants to press on all my sore spots right now, he knows which ones.
Only it no longer has absolutely any influence on me.
Yesterday, she didn't want to talk about him and his drama at Mishka's.
You can't close banks (it's not raining), I'll close them when it stops rainingüôÇ
I simply feel uncomfortable in my own body.
This is my classmate who is Ukrainian.
Oleksandra here runs from one corner to another, there is so much going on that her eyes are scattered and she wants to be everywhere at once.
Only these scissors should be used for seamstresses.
Good morning, I will come to you for the printer within 20 minutes.
Can I give you back the money for the doctor?
Your coffee has already arrived, I can bring it tomorrow.
You can leave your purchases in the car, we will pick up the children and take the things.
I have already written to you twice :)) but I am making a double circle for the trains.
I didn't understand, will Valya and I be alone together in the morning?
Did you mean that we clean up on our own and you just supervise?
Can Valya and I exchange shifts? Valya in the morning and me in the afternoon?
Mom will live here in the dormitory because the fee for the dormitory is low here.
The main thing is that I have a place to live.
Sasha was absent from school today, so I wrote to the teacher by email.
Helloüëãüèª I got sick, so it would be better to reschedule our meeting for the next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake pastries.
In Ukraine, borscht, varenyky, and other dishes are traditional.
I don't have favorite dishes, I love trying various dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something.
More precisely, there is a train, but there are no seats available.
Sorry, but we are a little late.
Lucia, can I also be a helper in the kitchen?
It's great that Yulia will have the opportunity to go to work.
Yesterday evening, I went to their apartment.
It is very spacious and comfortable there.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there will be a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops beating - we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian Armed Forces suffer defeats there, the Russians may abandon negotiations and reoccupy the previously liberated territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today."
It beats - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops beating, we will have weaker positions.
They (city defenders) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies onto themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the area of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these areas, we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all the steps that can lead to the return even to the cities that we have currently de-occupied.
They can go for it.
Then our position in negotiations will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we observe.
"We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for diplomatic resolution if we have it."
Direct speech: "People will perceive peace in any case, because people want this war to end."
In our minds, the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war should end in peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to an end in war.
So, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
"You can't fight for the sake of fighting when there's nothing left, no people."
Good day, do you still have available spots in the Czech course for adults at 7:00 PM on Tuesday?
You can meet your family in Kutn√° Hora if you wish.
And these two are my cousins.
So, I understand.
I'm not sure if I'll manage to clean up by 1:00 pm because it's a big apartment and there's a lot to clean.
I will try to clean up quickly, but I can't promise.
I will write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominika, who is responsible for purchasing consumables?
Is this a permanent procedure or do we need to order as it finishes?
Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space in Ukrainian literature is precisely the study of its state.
The use of Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows for an analysis of the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.
Perhaps you know how to inform online that I have found employment and no longer require assistance?
I don't have the opportunity to go in person(((((( Thank you, this form needs to be printed out to fill out.
Do you not know when it is possible to live there?
Do you have a basket? We would like to ask for it on Sunday for the Easter blessing.
Children are the meaning of our life. You never get tired of it. Good night.
Don't change the subject. I'm asking you directly now: Do you want to continue communicating or not? If not, then let me know already.
In addition, we go to work and save money.
On Monday, we will have a leadership meeting and we will decide how and when we will hold it at our place.
Well, because I started to realize that I misunderstood something and ended up in the wrong place.
I think this is the right decision, it's better to have fewer people and provide quality help to them, than to have many people.
My 16-year-old daughter and I are looking for temporary shelter in the Czech Republic, where my daughter plans to study at the university.
We have now finally seen each other. The conversation was more like a correspondence, but it also turned out well.
Help me find books in Czech language.
My name is Oksana. I am a theater critic and a lecturer at the university. Additionally, I work as an expert for the Ukrainian Cultural Fund and as an expert for a theater festival.
My husband is an athlete. I enjoy tourism and have a son.
I can help with cleaning.
To go or not, you simply had to understand me.
If you can lend me money for medicine, please do!
Then I will be downloading through my VPN across Ukraine.
I am looking for a job as an accountant, but while I am learning the language, I can do some administrative work.
I understand that I won't be taken immediately to work as an accountant somewhere in a company.
When a child has a birthday, they bring juice or fruit for the whole class, something for all the children?
Of course we will be able to come, thank you!
What other education, besides Czech language courses, would you like for yourself?
Oh, how complicated everything is :)
In Ukraine, mobile operators work 24 hours a day every day, whether it's by phone or online, regardless of holidays :)
I am going to work tomorrow morning around 6:00-6:20 and will be home after lunch.
If you have time, we will try to change the tariff plan tomorrow evening.
But today our city was bombed again and I'm afraid for my son.
I want to escape from here as soon as possible.
I didn't quite understand.
Dear brother Albert, me and my family are very grateful to you for your support and for the gift you gave us!
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
With respect, the Bezverkha family.
Okay, thank you for the conversation. I'll take a pill and go to bed to rest. Sweet dreams to you üôèüèª
My name is Ciara, we are from Ukraine, I have a daughter who is 7 years old and my mother is with us.
I am looking for a job... but there is a problem, I cannot stand for long periods of time after the surgery, so it is very difficult to find something suitable for me.
I am temporarily living in Prague 9. I am ready to move anywhere if there is a job. I would be very grateful for advice or offers.
But if you don't want to communicate with me, then I'm sad.
Why did you decide that such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for something.
It is important for a person to change, especially spiritually.
I will give you this money as soon as the bank approves it.
Around 30,000 UAH for debts that you have plus 30,000 UAH for you to keep.
Janka, I hope everything is good with you, and your grandmother won't call me bad names.
I'm trying to get Sasha to go to sleep...It's necessary for him to get at least a little bit of sleep...
A code is needed for the dining room.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who were involved in committing military crimes in the city of Bucha in the Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced this on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian should know their names!
"The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of military personnel from the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade who are directly involved in committing military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the statement reads.
The GUAMOU states that all war criminals who have committed crimes against the peaceful population of Ukraine will be brought to trial and held accountable.
You can view the list by following the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian aggressors.
In liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by Russian military have been recorded.
On April 1st, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
The Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken out from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from Russian aggressors.
On February 24th, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.
Russian aggressor forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launch systems, ballistic missiles, and aerial bombs.
Good day, I'm sorry, but I won't be able to work for you because I will be flying to Canada soon.
Immediately after the dash there are formal names, after the slash there are slang expressions, in parentheses - abbreviations used on the schedule.
I don't want to disturb you, rest.
I looked at the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brands.
Just good clothes at normal prices and with sizes available.
We were at the store at the railway station.
Are the professions being offered possible without knowledge of the language?
This is important, if there is such a tradition, then I need to know so that I can prepare.

Tomorrow there may be poor communication on the road.
I am grateful to every person for their experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I have gained experience from every situation for myself so as not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of this Regulation.
I am confident that there will be no problem with this.
In Ukraine, many people also celebrate this week.
It depends on the religion.
Is the person Greek Catholic or Catholic?
At the beginning, you can try it for free.
Can you write us a payment algorithm, we will pay ourselves.
The paper that children receive at the end of the school year is a report card, while birth and marriage certificates are received separately.
Yes! He's on it like an experienced driver! But I don't know if that's better. I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
There it is written that it is necessary to fill out a "curriculum vitae" in Czech...
I will try to make it on time because I still have to sign documents at the town hall.
My spouse is not angry that you are on the phone.
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Virgin Mary for you.
May they wrap you in their blanket of love and warmth on this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Are you okay with me coming right after the war?
The location, day, and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It's great, I have money for two months of rent, the district in Olomouc doesn't matter, I would be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal abuse of civilians north of Kyiv.
Photographs of people who were tortured and shot have disturbed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are questioning each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
And I wasn't surprised by anything at all. Exactly what I was sad and waiting for is happening...
I evacuated children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then he returned to the capital to work only after spending time with his female colleagues and their children.
Since 2014, I have consistently been helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine and have never doubted for a moment that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) allowed a copy to be taken from the execution case of my great-grandfather: the case was over a hundred pages long, but the death sentence was very simple and therefore even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate and denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was a free person, a poor "one-yard" nobleman, and never went into serfdom.
The fact that they lived in hamlets and had a few cows was enough to condemn the farmer and the caregiver of young children to execution.
Relatives didn't even find out about the burial place.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and all of them were killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, there is the surname of the informant Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and wouldn't be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that sentenced the peasants to execution were ethnic Russians.
While analyzing my great-grandfather's case, I became interested in various informational resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) informational resources in Russia, such as "Immortal Barracks", which qualitatively remind us of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who discovered mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited by the system and then destroyed.
Supposedly, files with child pornography were found on their computer, they were sent to prison for it, and then they quickly died there.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to uncover the truth about the crimes of the past century.
What are you suddenly surprised about their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most repulsive traits of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism were imposed on top of the thousand-year-old Tatar-Mongol tradition in the 16th-19th centuries.
And then, a bestial genetic experiment was conducted on what had emerged, cutting out intelligence during several waves of the Red Terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it all was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask your spouse what I can buy for a cough?
Sorry, I have no one to ask.
I wanted to ask if you know where the children went, because Galia can't find them.
Lyubosh, Igor is asking if it's convenient for you to go tomorrow? (He's off and can go because they haven't checked the car at the station yet today).
It is very inconvenient for us to bother you so much.
You are helping us a lot, thank you!!
During the dismantling of the debris of two multi-storey residential buildings in Borodianka near Kyiv, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
Defenders of Mariupol reported the spraying of an unknown poisonous substance over the city from a Russian drone.
Three people were injured.
Approximately 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are being held in Russian prisons.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector companies.
During the past day, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of automotive equipment, one helicopter, and three drones were destroyed in battles in eastern Ukraine.
Your coffee will arrive today.
I have my first "bicycle" after my son.
What do girls do after returning from school?
We arrived at the place where we were accommodated outside the center of Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big "but" - men who drink alcohol and smoke indoors live here, loud music is the minimum of what "upsets", the smell of cigarettes, drunk men and us with children... it's scary to go to bed, to be honest.
Please help with accommodation, for money please.
But where it will be safe and not smoky.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, it's as if someone is smoking right here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on their feet, shouting something, something is not to their liking. It's very scary.
I am simply praying, if you can helpüôèüèº
The main thing is that we understood each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful kindergarten, such pleasant educators.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, I'm very grateful to you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Good evening Stephanie, Agatha wants to participate in the game, she missed playing üòâ
We don't reach that manhole.
For now, we are not ready to pay such money, so we will wait for help and then plan something.
How can I get to the apartment today to clean it?
If I am near the main entrance, should I inform you and you will open it?
I wanted to see the cake for Karina if I had time.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone is following the Facebook page.
They asked to convey greetings to you and say that they find it very interesting to read the news.
They were talking about people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
We agreed that if a child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, I can help them over the phone after work.
I need to change the bedding, 2 sets.
This suits me especially during holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to Easter rituals.
Thank you üèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏è, today I will write down my work data.
I really enjoyed the data, thank you for organizing it.
So far, Nestor only has a runny nose, but Galinka has a temperature of 37.7 in the evening and 38.
The queue is moving very slowly at General Chapak's.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is for love to be real and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish and mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will work out.
So, we took it home and immediately drove it to Auntie's.
She was very, very grateful, she even cried.
I was telling her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
I said that if possible, there might be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessary. Only if it happens. I am also very grateful to you.
I always felt sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.
I had many questions for God about why situations were happening in my life that just made me lose faith in everything.
And do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made a gathering.
This is true, but we are still not familiar with the area and do not know where everything is located. Today we searched for a supermarket for an hour and had to walk back. Two blankets are not suitable, so we need two of a larger size.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your father only know how to communicate in Russian or does anyone else in the family?
Is it possible for the children to come to Valya and play in the hall?
Well, let's take a risk then :)
I am also glad that I met you.
Volodymyr and I talked about housing, whether to wait until they find something or to search on my own. The ladies who live with us also said that we need to go to the metro station "Muzeyna" where there is an institution that helps to find housing.
Because of a little one, I will cross the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
It would be good on Thursday if possible.
I cannot call the doctor because I have not yet completed the examination for the food license.
But I can't call him because I'm out of money on my account.
I cannot top up my phone because I do not understand Czech online banking and my Ukrainian bank card cannot be topped up.
In the Vodafone app, I cannot change my tariff to have normal calls and internet, nor can I top up my number.
I am going crazy.
Where the price doesn't shock, but the face... The title doesn't sound right, what did you mean?
I am ashamed to sit without work.
I just wrote that at school during class.
Sorry for bothering you, I was just very worried.
This is closer to the point where they will leave the borders of Ukraine to know for sure that they will arrive.
Because now everyone's life is in question.
Okay. Size for 10-11 years old. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I am looking for everything for the home and for the children.
"Thanks to the people who accepted me, I live in a chapel. They always ask if I need something, but I am ashamed to say and I try to find it myself."
I just got home and now I'm having breakfast :)
Don't explain anything, please, just act as if I'm not here.
It is impossible to respond without a submitted resume.
Mom, I won't be able to tell you this :)
And I'm really a little out of sorts right now that I couldn't hold back my feelings before we left the apartment.... Like tonight....
God willing, Yura will fall asleep üôè and maybe I will go to bed right away to get some rest.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Suzana, help me. I received payment for March. Is it for both of us, me and Yulia, or just for me? I can't figure out why the amount is like this.
So, you can make copies of passports when it's convenient for you :)
We have one of the best high schools in the region in our village.
üòÇüòãI'm already having fun talking to you, and I even like it üòâ
I turned to Caritas, where they offered temporary housing for a week or two, but I need permanent housing where I can be with my child, and why there is less and less left.
The flowers bloomed. Everything is fine. Everyone is rested and very beautiful.
As reported by "European Truth", Welt writes about it with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Also proposed are howitzers in the variant on the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at distances of over 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government sources with reference to KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the contract is signed, which is before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And is this for me in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find out how to replenish the account and I will write back to you. Thank you.
"I am going to work tomorrow without passing the commission, and then when my doctor recovers, I will pass the commission. Did I understand correctly?"
How can I change my T-Mobile tariff plan to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns right now?
Hello, I'm sorry. I want to know if you need a worker.
You can wash the floor or the dishes.
I am from Ukraine, unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need work.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I agree to any job.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I learn every day, so I think I will learn everything necessary to work without problems.
I must have talked too much to you today, it's probably time for you to sleep so you can work tomorrow.
If possible, I will take these pants for work. The size fits me.
You are smart and everything will be fineüôè Rest, recharge your strength and beauty with a good night's sleep!!!üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø
On their birthday, Katka tries to end their life by suicide on Charles Bridge.
Did you manage to chat with someone?
We wanted to solve the issue with the Easter card. We don't have internet banking and we don't know how to set it up. What do we need to do?
Should we address the gentleman we live with?
Always say goodbye when you leave.
Sure, we can meet after 5 pm.
Can I send the laundry to the apartment tomorrow and hang it to dry in the garage?
Hello. Yes, I will be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How long did you study for this specialty?
If it were warm, it would be very good.
I submitted an online application. I will try to go today after work.
We are doing well. We manage with the stove heating, we have experience with it in Ukraine. We have gas, but since it is very expensive, we heat the stove with firewood.
Good day, Lena, could you please tell me where there is a stationery store nearby?
Tomorrow we are going to Prague to look at an apartment.
All was resolved on its own.
I have to take Karinka with me.
"I put the laundry in, came home and translated what was written on the chair near the washing machine - "repairing the channel", can I do laundry or do I need to turn off the washing machine?"
It says that my status will change within 24 hours. But why? What kind of comedy is this? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My ex-husband can't calm down, he writes me poems (it's a real drama).
I want everything that officially connects us with him to end as soon as possible. üôè
Thank you because something doesn't work out well for us here.
And we already have a product from the nursery.
"Sorry, it means I messed something up."
I didn't understand Czech so well back then.
I probably made something up for myself.
They walk to school like this because three of them, Halya and Svyatoslav, are studying remotely and will finish school in Ukraine and receive their diplomas in the fall. They will need to apply to universities.
Can you tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is a mystery between two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
The man and woman themselves decide the issues in their family, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are together.
Why not try it this way for now?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do we need to leave?
So, I am happy to listen to jazz.
Thank you, I am working with this application. We talked about it in our Czech language course on Wednesday.
For the past four years, I haven't let anyone get close to me, read a lot of philosophy books, and worked on myself.
When they cause a lot of pain, it's hard for you to trust.
But one must try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, that's life.
Martine, we are already going to bed.
Thank you for such a nice and fun day.
We all liked it very much.
We feel ourselves like in our own family.
The children spent the whole evening telling their dad, all the grandmas and grandpas how much they enjoyed being with you.
Greetings from the girls! We send our best wishes for the holidays üòâ
And where were we looking now?
I hope that my son will come out alive from this meat grinder.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How can I get in touch with them so that they can open the door?
Is there any improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Very grateful for helping people. If you can, please help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are currently in Slapy, our friends have sheltered us for a while.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist and rehabilitation specialist looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing close to civilization.
I just really needed to submit it today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.
I prepare cabbage rolls like this: I dilute tomato paste in 0.5 liters of water in a pot, add 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste and bring it to a boil.
I put the cabbage rolls in a pot and pour this sauce over them.
Bake in the oven for approximately 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this number?
I have to bring all of this.
Starting from Monday the 4th.
In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can request humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Labor Management at the Prague Market.
Branch in room #29 is designated specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance, therefore there is a translator on site.
Lidia has already been accepted to school, but due to illness, we will go on Tuesday. I informed the teacher today.
I am sitting, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy üò¢.
"I don't know, my dear, how are you?"
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel about it in a way that we are together. That we are a couple.
I would say that there will be a lot of work after the war.
I am not afraid that I will not find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
I am not afraid because I did not end up in any of them.
I just don't know how it will be with housing. üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to undergo an examination to obtain a food license. Can I do it with you?
Please advise, tomorrow I need to prepare the apartment for 5 guests.
Fifth place, I understand, is in the room with the television?
To fold out and make the sofa bed?
Can we stay with you until Mrs. Margarita finds us accommodation?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, but previously used, it is functional but not needed.
Write the address in Czech and let's look at the map to see where it is located in relation to us.
I don't know how much free space there is there, so I can't plan anything with furniture. You want to finally see that apartment this week and then understand what furniture I need.
"Sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a work day and it was difficult to adapt."
Is this enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, to have the opportunity to hug you.
To kiss you in the morning and tell you how good you look.
There is already a crib and a bathtub for the child here, I found things for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you have the opportunity, but not to give away the last. ü§´üòüüòâüôÉ
I want to get a haircut called "shapochka".
Oleg got sick - he has weakness and cough. It's better if you don't bring Yana with you to us so that she doesn't get infected.
Only I will be a little later - around 8. Is it okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I am worried that everything will be okay!?
We didn't even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important it is for you!
And as for myself, I remain silent (for me, it's just an unattainable peak)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, slept badly.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that we started translating the test poorly with Kolya yesterday.
I will ask either Hryhoriy Denysenko or Yonashka)) if they can help me a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them in some way?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to brush up on mathematical terms on the weekends.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Kolya to make sure it's error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We also hope for this very much.
Otherwise, she is very happy with any gift.
I would like to connect the internet to my Czech number.
Yesterday at the stop of the 402 bus, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay aside.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
Yesterday evening, I thanked God for this girl because she was the first person from Ukraine who made my heart feel mutual.
Branch in room #29 is designated specifically for the submission and processing of applications for assistance.
It turned out that I ordered a spare card.
It's not worth it, I'm just a human.
So that she wouldn't be scared that nobody came.
I didn't go. I baked it myself. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So, are you leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life within territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe."
"We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
"If the 'evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,' he said, 'there can only be one answer for us Germans: never again!'"
"The fight must continue."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of the cities it has blockaded, and letting them die from disease.
Russian troops are carrying out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually reminiscent of the shootings in Babi Yar.
Germans have been seeing this in real-time news for over a month.
So, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also supplying weapons, which not long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" doesn't just mean standing against the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are happening in Ukraine.
I'll sing you one lullaby.
We agree, arrange the tour and let us know when to gather.
Everyone was sick except for Lidia, they had a new strain of COVID called Omicron.
Then I will do it tomorrow.
I use this ticket instead of a card.
Call about the delay of documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias to the conductor.
Sergiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect.
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea, and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of opponents of NATO began to decrease, while supporters, on the contrary, began to increase.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's entry into NATO and the assistance that NATO provides during times of war, there is currently a lot of criticism towards the Alliance and its member countries for the delayed delivery of weapons, refusal to close the sky, and reluctance to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to Russia's position, if it can stop the war and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions", together with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about how exactly the Alliance has been helping Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and what the Alliance is criticized for in vain, why our perspective of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here?
In my Volt account, my partner is marked as my application under consideration.
"I submitted it through this mobile application."
There is no visa, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, where they did not give visas but gave a pass.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis left today in a good mood.
Agreed with the boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school so that he can show me everything.
So I hope that everything is okay with him.
Because I don't like it that way, I don't last long.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.
I am leaving the children alone and waiting there for 3-4 hours and then I am going home because I cannot leave them any longer.
Take your brother with you for a 6-7 year morning.
So, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he acted improperly and I left him.
After some time, he returned again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Later, after some time, he called to say that he had undergone heart surgery.
Asking him to just talk, I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
During this hour, we communicated a lot.
At that time, I also started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I started to think that maybe it's really necessary to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me to get married, but two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our fates.
What does "ready for marriage" mean to you?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find accommodation, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my child.
Should you have mentioned me earlier?
Because I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I myself understand that a translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor or if she needs to give me a paper.
They probably forgot it, so I put it in the closet.
You probably need to go to bed now to work tomorrow.
Can someone help, we need things for a woman size XS or S, height 165. And also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you.
That time at Lidl, I bought two packs and my mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You lifted my mood.
Okay, let's talk about something else, because I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm still dozing off and dreaming that bombs are exploding...
God is never late, everything has its time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I fully understand the value of unskilled labor and I realize that I won't be able to have a job like the one I had at home in Kiev and earn the same amount of money here.
But I can't just sit and do nothing because then all sorts of negative thoughts crawl into my head, so I need to occupy myself with some physical activity.
Documents are processed at the airport from 7am to 7pm, at other times you can simply wait.
Volodymyr turned around at 4 in the morning.
That's why we took them to ourselves.
We slept with Vika in the kitchen, then we moved them to the bedroom.
I will finish work and go to the airport with them.
When he is with you, write and you will find out what happens next...
Otherwise, I can't find a place for myself anymore.
Sir, please, these are invitations for Ukrainian children who will be entering gymnasium.
"So, but I find it difficult to do."
Okay, write to me when it's convenient üòò
I don't know about work yet. Of course, I would like to, if I can arrange for the children to go to kindergarten and school.
We planned it that way. Is it better if we sometimes change the plan?
I'm sorry. I really didn't miss any calls since Wednesday. Sorry, can we arrange another time?
I offer a job of cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, and dusting.
The job is for about 3-4 hours. The pay is 800 UAH one-time. Starting from Tuesday, April 19th at 2:00 PM.
I hope to tell you that everything is fine with us just now.
Can I give you a call?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
In English: In our culture, the name Hanna is considered the native form of the name Ania.
Her uncle brought it from home.
We made an English version and added new partners.
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please üôèüèª
Do the classes on Monday and Wednesday differ?
Thank you very much. You do a lot for our family! We are all infinitely grateful to you.
To be in the pool, you need a certificate.
But that's my opinion.
She was given roller skates and a board for skating by my uncle from home, and she used to skate on them at home, so this must be.
I also got up at 9 o'clock, and I'm only preparing breakfast now.
I am very sorry that you are communicating with me on your day off. I hope I am not too annoying.
We want to inform about the change of residence and at the same time submit documents for the extension of the card.
We are currently providing medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you that there will be a snack tomorrow.
One mother said she will bake donuts with jam for the children.
He comes to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments for the next month, even for an approximate understanding of which days?
I just can't remember this schedule.
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv, saying "they have never done such a thing before."
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation."
"If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
Russians were launching missile strikes on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, the debris of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-story building in the Poznyaky district of the capital.
On February 26th, a Russian missile hit a multi-story building on Valeriy Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1st, Russians hit a TV tower near Babyn Yar in Dorohozhychi, as a result of which 5 pedestrians died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the building of the Ministry of Defense near the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed enemy rocket smashed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka, Kyiv.
On March 18th, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vinogradar, resulting in one person's death and 19 others being injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, resulting in the deaths of at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko reiterated on April 13 that it is still too early for residents who evacuated the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance in the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1st, an oil depot near Belgorod in Russia exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are sweating at the mere thought of NATO fighters shooting down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky is not convincing European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he is convincing European people who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this delicate blend of strength, emotion, and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is strongly against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Paris or Brussels may be against speeding up Ukraine's entry, but this process is already underway.
"I understand you, so I don't want you to think of us as scammers."
The funds you collect are better to give to people who are in greater need.
I can come to you and we will decide on the spot. I don't mind as long as I can help.
But the air is clean, that's a plusüòÄ
It says there that I have a tariff "Together for two without internet", but I asked to have internet instead.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have some other room today or just stairs up and down as usual?
So I'm already on my way while you're taking the train.
"But I will never stop loving you, you are everything to me."
This loan is being handled by a financial consultant.
So it will take a few days for this.
Katya was asking about the internet, can we give her the password?
I thought you and Milan didn't meet each other.
Great, then my husband will give me a ride because he has a company car from the construction company where he works today.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One needs to cut it into 4 parts.
One of these particles can be used for 2-3 days, but rinse every hour.
I am interested in architecture and local color.
I am very glad that everything is okay with you.
Most likely, at 4:20 pm, the concert will start at 6, and after it, I will be free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
I will make tea and we will have some candy.
I have switched to the school's page and now I will try to order Ani's lunch for tomorrow.
But I love to go for a walk on weekends in the city.
Can we go there tomorrow and find out the conditions?
My name is Sasha and I came from Luhansk to Prague.
I am a certified massage therapist and nurse with 27 years of experience in the field of neurology.
I offer therapeutic massages and a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech languages and I am intensively learning.
Contact: ------ would like to receive an email so that even Czechs could write to you through a translator, SMS doesn't work here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you won't be able to understand each other.
Do you really not want this price list?
He helps people see what they are worth and what they have to do it.
If you don't need a price list, then I won't provide it.
Tell me how you want it, and I will do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write to me today... for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely - today I am asking only for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so please bear with me.
Is everything okay with your imagination?
You live your ordinary life, go to work, plan purchases, and vacations.
You have dreams.
You plan to buy the same dress that you saw yesterday in the shopping center.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain cannot perceive this.
He clings to the old reality.
You are calling work to find out if you have to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it's not for long.
Now we are making arrangements, something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many of our leaders did not give us wages for our work.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How can I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You don't have the ability to take many things.
You practically didn't take anything from home... you have to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning till evening, you drag children around Prague.
And what's next? Unknown. How much is it? Unknown. The children are asking for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
And from every iron - we don't have such.
We have a choice - to stay there and put our children in danger, or to try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy with the hearts and things that the children gave her when she came to school.
You should have called me when you were coming.
I will write to you in the evening.
So, I only believe in God and entrust my life to Him.
I no longer have the strength for all of this.
I thought you had fallen in love with some Ukrainian girl and didn't have time to communicate üòá
I have looked through the menu and even ordered already.
Would you be interested in joint events with your Czech neighbors, friends, or community?
If so, then of what specific type, kind.
Please send the page with the visa or entry stamp (red with date).
Without visas for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libu≈°e, did you pay for the nursery?
Because I can't understand.
You do so much good for us.
We are in great debt to you... thank you!
So, I understand that this is very good.
Now I will send you a photo of the business card of the lady whom I am teaching English to.
So what will you write tomorrow, shall we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be great to know someone from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Do you want to meet up after 4:00 pm?
What are your overall impressions of the first week?
Karina brought us medicine the day before yesterday and we are taking it.
I can work with bedridden patients and disabled children.
But be sure to mention that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I borrow a hammer from you?
Because there is only antibacterial gel there.
I can't say for sure because I'm not very familiar with the city yet... It's around half past 12.
What services/activities do you think are necessary/missing for elderly people?
I don't know because I haven't received an SMS from the bank and I haven't even taken the bank card yet, and the children deleted the banking application, which made me very sad.
Then please write to me how you will be traveling üôèüèª
Today we have joy - our city Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, our troops have arrived.
There is a cleanup operation against the enemy - they are searching for Russians in basements and apartments.
The entire city is mined, and the demining work will begin.
And Ivan looked to see if something needed to be repaired or finished there.
Diana, as you wish. Maybe he will be embarrassed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay at home, saying that he gets tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will bake mazanets and do our lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs who have opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractor drivers who actually go out into the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to travel in convoys to temporarily occupied territories today in order to deliver aid and evacuate people from there.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly travel to the combat zone, calm and assist refugees in the carriages, and help volunteers load humanitarian aid onto the trains at peaceful stations.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utility workers who, under fire, remove garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary resources.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their free time they also volunteer, collecting medical kits for the front.
In Ukraine, the juice stops when there are small leaves.
Please tell me, small children - what age do you have in mind?
My daughter is 8 years old, is that an acceptable age?
I am looking for accommodation for myself and my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and submit our passports for Canadian visa processing.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people at the visa center and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, the train journey takes a lot of time, and it will be difficult for the child.
Therefore, she decided to search for accommodation in Prague or nearby.
No, everything suits us.
Where to record yesterday's readings.
But I can't change the password when I follow the link because it gives me an error.
This is in the microwave, something was burning.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks are always in touch with clients 24 hours a day and all issues are promptly resolved :)
Well, nothing, I'll get used to the new realities.
I am very sorry and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post. The most important thing is that there is truth there.
So, the television is overflowing with this.
We have already agreed on the refrigerators and some Czech guys responded. They will come at 1 pm and help us move them.üëçüëçüëç
I want to come to you. Hug you tightly. And kiss you. üòò
At 7:30 am, I read the history of world theater for actors, directors, and theater scholars.
In the evening, I evaluate projects. After dinner.
Grishko will sleep, he cried a lot at night, a tooth is coming out.
I am currently on the phone with all the acquaintances from Lviv, many people have died.
Czech Republic started issuing visas after March 22, in my opinion.
Until that time, they used such stamps and then equated these stamps with a cart.
The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (FED Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of premises for voting in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and premises on military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are located (Kosovo and DR Congo). The role of the district electoral commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only nationwide elections are held in the Overseas Electoral District: elections for the President and Members of Parliament, as well as nationwide referendums.
Local elections are not held in the ZVO.
They are at the train station near the room of the mother and child.
It says that he/she no longer understands where they should go.
Are you angry with me?
I will go and delete the photo in a swimsuit.
I don't need money anymore, I borrowed it from a friend for a long time üòä
I wanted to say that I have already connected a Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device for this, I visited the O2 operator and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. It's very inconvenient for me to work on Sundays and I can't do it anymore.
You said that your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. You need it too.
We don't have enough blankets, down blankets, or plates. The children don't have pajamas and don't have anything to change into.
Good morning, I will be leaving at 10...please send me the address again, I seem to have lost the message.
I don't want to torture either you or myself, I'll somehow deal with it within myself.
So it would have been good, but I know there were no free seats there, and in principle, they now have all the lessons according to the schedule and they are taught quite well.
Do you have a meat grinder to make minced meat? We have one, but it doesn't work.
Well, let it be after Easter already.
Yesterday, did your mother say that something was hurting you?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand everything they say. (But yesterday she came back in a great mood after that fair.)
Today I also went to school.
Today I saw Kristina's mom, but she didn't even say hello.
Very tasty apples, what kind are they?
The Head of the Office of the President, Andriy Yermak, announced that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that our allies are passing to us.
Yermak's direct speech: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and strive to "knock down" supplies of weapons by any means."
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred to Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender their weapons to allies, and it massively transfers to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn about such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten would cost per month and if it will be open during the summer?
Everyone is given according to their ability.
There are much sadder stories, believe me.
It means "I needed to experience such events in order to change."
In Torah it is written that God created evil in humans so that throughout their life journey they would change spiritually and become better.
This is your home, you can invite whoever you want.
We wanted to visit the town hall tomorrow before going to the hospital and find this lady on social media.
He listened to his mom and didn't come with us.
I know that it was not easy for you.
And I will do everything to make you happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I am happy.
I hope you were serious about it. üíû

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, while Moscow dismissed these reports as a "provocation".
"The reports of Ukrainian civilians being killed, raped, and severely injured by Russian forces are worthy of condemnation," said Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
Statements were made after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian forces who had occupied the area for several weeks.
Photos allegedly depicting the bodies of executed civilians with tied hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4th that there are signs that Russian troops committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, stated that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first few minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts for those who "ordered" this story," said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the images of Buki were "another staging by the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has requested the UN Security Council to convene on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4th, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement announcing an "investigation" into accusations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed," said Zelensky in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a shared responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures... For shots to the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city approximately 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw bodies that appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a location that, according to local residents, Russian forces used as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from close range.
Overall, the Ukrainian authorities have stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev that was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: Kyiv is not there." How the occupiers cruelly deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
There is one more item on this list about which there is significantly less information at the moment - the evacuation of the local population to enemy territory.
Approximately from the middle of March, Russian occupiers are "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and to the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko has effectively given to the Russian military range.
"Ukrainska Pravda" has found Ukrainians who were evacuated and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" is going and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary-compulsory evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintaining contact with their relatives.
However, due to statements from the Ukrainian government, many citizens were forcibly taken to Russia and Belarus.
So in Melitopol, Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynsky.
The family of Oleksandr, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers away from the village.
Homeland settled in the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
Like true scouts, Denis and Marina had gathered their emergency suitcases in advance, but they didn't have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
There was no car of their own, and suburban buses were no longer taking anyone.
At approximately 12 o'clock noon on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks until March 17th, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 pm on February 24th, people entered the entrance who were speaking neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Is anyone there?" - I say yes. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, and if there was any weapon.
All men were asked if they served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov."
These were Chechen OMON, not even military, young guys aged 25-35.
They said, "Ukrainians helped us during the war, including Sasha Bilyi (who commanded a unit of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking" that fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), and now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water was a big problem with it.
They broke into the store, took goods from there under the pretext of "the Russians will take everything anyway", and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still videos on the internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So after looting the store, they brought sausages and said, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful montage.
Our child said there: "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
They would constantly separate themselves from Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good people: "Putin is a degenerate, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they didn't fight, but rode to rob stores and looted.
They brought some chickens and tied a St. George ribbon to one leg and their own white tape to the other, calling it "oplotchanka".
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
"I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha so badly that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had mixed units - Chechens who did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to identify whether they were their own or strangers.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk airborne troops.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the buildings - our "Bayraktars" constantly hit it.
But they came and told us that the Ukrainian Armed Forces no longer exist, but there is "Azov", and according to them, there are about 1000 of them in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Somehow a Russian man came to us - either a paratrooper officer or an FSB representative - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - they were talking about Bucha, Hostomel, and we were thinking maybe we'll get a "green corridor" too.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You will be taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say that we don't want either here or there.
What they responded with was: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they would drive us into the basement and start shooting from under the house - either with "Grads" or mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring buildings simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor of our house.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of them did not go, saying that it was for traitors of the homeland - as if to say, "they will shoot you there, sell your organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, with ruins and broken equipment on both sides of the road, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took the equipment away to their country.
There are a lot of trenches, buried equipment, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we went through an improvised control, many people didn't have any documents at all because they were burned.
We were accommodated in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket is firing, and a trace is visible - "Iskander" was working on Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, those are planes flying, turning at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Venger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said, "Here I am, a Ukrainian from Chernihiv."
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they defeat these thieves of yours.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
"He will do as he says."
They were offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representation (at least that's what they called themselves) spread misinformation that men cannot travel to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with documents - our daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, but in Minsk at the train station they said that without passports nobody will be allowed on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and accompanied.
They couldn't hold me in the sanatorium.
Our migration representative told our second group that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
While passing by Mozyr (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw ballistic missile launches towards Ukraine: the missile first takes off, shines beautifully, and then fades away.
People who got on the bus in Mozyr were telling that Russians constantly shoot from the firing ranges there.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
One woman told us that something will break in her son if he is called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, generally does not believe.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not realize that their training grounds are being used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, we were waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration and deciding what we will do next.
"In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags now as Estonian ones."
Marina lived in a military town in Hostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, cannot - the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, will you not be able to meet somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we always welcome you as guests!
Thank you for the agreement, the butterflies are beautiful.
And in this small apartment, the Wi-Fi doesn't work, so I mostly answer all your questions and now I don't know what to do? And the children have online classes from Monday, but there is no internet.
So, will I be living with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
In the Quran it is written: "Even a leaf from a tree falls with His knowledge."
Our children are studying online, I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner, that is, I am a versatile worker. Mariana is a specialist in eyelash extensions and can work from home, while the other Mariana has no specific profession, that is, she is also a versatile worker.
Can we agree on how to do it better?
On April 1st, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced joyful news - Ukrainian soldiers liberated the city from Russian aggressors on March 31st.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it became known that in just one town of Bucha, Russians had shot at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were killed right on the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the back of the head, some of the victims were minors.
The village elder of Motyzhyn, Olha Sukhenko, her husband Ihor, and their son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found beaten and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Oleksandr were in a mass grave, while Igor's was in the sewer.
Bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found 20 km away from Kyiv, beside the road.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home.
I ordered a package from Germany with the help of DHL.
Yesterday they were supposed to deliver it to me, but no one contacted me and the package was not delivered, and the DHL website says that the recipient could not be found.
Therefore, the package was sent to the post office and the address of this branch was indicated.
How can I take her?
When I was little, I could be at the river several times a day, the river was right by the house, very close, but now I rarely go because I don't have time and sometimes I don't feel like it, I only go with my sister. üôÇ
Please tell me, is this accommodation that you sent someone renting it out or what?
I was asked to go with acquaintances of my acquaintance to an exhibition and help them arrange protection visas.
I spent almost the whole day. I got a little tired of people.
This is a nice house and we can do the cleaning ourselves very well.
How to understand if there are free seats in the circle or not.
Russia will declare a default on its external debt, CNN reports citing Standard & Poor's agency.

Understood.. Do you want me to write it here or bring the written note tomorrow?
This proverb is spot on.
You see, there is something in common, we love to experiment with food üòä
Well, so that there would be work and at least a store.
Good day, I was just offered a job as a dentist in Prague, so thank you very much for your concern and I apologize.
She is very disrespectful and somewhat irresponsible.
If she misses her stop, she forgets her phone or if she doesn't answer her phone now and hasn't written to me that she's at school and everything is okay :)
And I'm worried about her because she's not at home, but in another, not quite familiar state.
I hope that I have found mathematics correctly.
"You didn't think that I am still a child."
And of course, work also interests me.
But if I'm not very physically fit, because I don't have such a good physical shape.
I could pay for housing at moderate prices if someone provided me with a room.
You communicate a lot, maybe you will know someone.
Good day, I am very interested in the job, but we do not speak Czech language.
At what time can we give clothes to be washed?
The charitable organization Archdiocesan Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians who are in the Czech Republic, specifically in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine, Russians are raping women and their children are forced to witness it.
Then they may also rape, mutilate the body and children witness it all.
Good day, I am talking to you in my thoughts - I need to learn Czech language, but I can't tear myself away from the news.
I often communicate with you in my thoughts. It seems to me that you can hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
"He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth"."
"All equipment, everything they have already sent, for some types of equipment it was done too late."
Because when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, what now?
I see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, it's really true.
"And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Zelensky.
When asked if Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president answered, "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would not have been this war or it would have had a different appearance.
If it had unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
"But I am confident that there would not have been a war," he added.
Let us remind you that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military aid, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
"I have a dream that the war is over and to return home."
Please write to me about everything that will be needed.
I wanted to ask you if you know where the blender on our kitchen came from.
Destructive actions in the form of spreading fakes and disinformation are aimed at provoking panic and disorganization, which are sensitive to public safety.
I am from Ukraine, currently located in Pilsen.
Before the war in Ukraine, I worked as a designer of women's and children's clothing made from various materials. I can also sew using specialized equipment and do alterations.
I really want to work in my field, happy to share my knowledge and gain new experience in this industry.
Of course it's normal that you want to meet up. I was just joking.
So, it can be done either way.
Today I read that they should enter the system themselves.
They need to be told this and dealt with.
Great, then I will write tomorrow and we will agree on the exact time.
Please take a photo of the examples you solved for me.
Is she a good advocate?
We went to this address to ask about some notebooks needed for school, maybe we didn't end up in the right place.
And a mother's prayer is the strongest.
I hear a lot - the war is on 10% of the territory of Ukraine.
Why do people run away?
Why don't they live in areas where there is no war?
Are you in your right mind?
Did you live in a warring state?
When prices soared by 100-200%.
When the majority of enterprises do NOT WORK.
When there is nowhere to earn money.
When do children hear air defense systems?
Did you live like that?
You can't even imagine.
And God forbid that they have it.
If you find out too - it will be HORRIBLE.
Therefore, we are running away.
Some of us are lost with phones... that remained from our previous life... so, some have not adapted in a month.
Would you be able to adapt from scratch in a month?
So, the state gives us 5000 crowns.
Would you be able to live on this amount of money?
Many funds provide food.
Have you tried riding the metro with children for charity?
When you're looking for food in one, clothes in another, and there's no time left to go to the third.
And tomorrow to go again... because the food they gave is only enough for a day.
You WANT to provide for yourself... but what about the children?
How to live without knowing the language?
When you can't even ask for help.
So, there are free courses... but what to choose?
Looking for work, food, clothing, or courses?
I have more questions than answers in a month.
But my children cannot be there.
Simply - understand us.
You come to the town hall and at the reception downstairs, you say that you are looking for Mrs. Krzhkovska, if they do not show you the way and the door number to her.
This will be written on his door, the department head is.
If you can't come to an agreement, call Dominique, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krzhkovska hasn't arrived yet, wait for her for a minute. She said she has a meeting before this, so she might be a little late, but she knows about you and scheduled you for this 9 o'clock appointment specifically so you can make it to the doctor on time.
So, of course, it would be very good to spend time together.
Please encourage me with kind words, you seem calming to me...
It is easy to use and not expensive.
I really need the internet for work.
How can I connect to the internet?
Perhaps someone has already been taken, so they are not lifting anyone else.
Good evening! Did we forget to write about the Czech language courses?
We have already missed the first one. üòâüôÑ
I feel a little sorry because I really understand how much I need it.
I have never talked about relationships, I haven't talked about them and I haven't expected any relationships.

You have nature all around you and cheerful neighbors.
I found accommodation, but it doesn't have furniture and dishes. Could you help me find some second-hand furniture? Thank you.
On the first day of illness, you can arrange a diet in clean brought dishes (food).
On other days, the State Consumer Service does not have the right to subsidized meals provided by the government.
After the food is taken home, the kitchen staff is no longer responsible for the quality and health of the food.
Hello. Martin, please check if the refrigerator is working. Thank you.
We will meet her with great pleasure!
I really appreciate such support!
Anita also mentioned Friday today, and suggested that she and Anna visit your center after Anna's school.
An unexpected encounter at the beginning of the hostilities with Polish comrades grew into a good friendship.
It's very cool and pleasant to find like-minded people where you didn't expect or search for them.
The bank will submit a loan application on Monday.
By the way, about the return.
Yesterday you said that you were ready to accept me as your partner. And as your partner, I don't want any money back.
What's mine is yours.
And you know this perfectly well.
I will always be happy to make new acquaintances.
Because I am actually always unsure of my abilities, and I need such words!
We were home by 3:00 PM. We went with Kristina and her family to the Visegrad Castle.

I went to the store with my mom and sister.
They arrived, cooked food, and talked.
I went out to the yard to breathe some fresh air, did a little cleaning in the yard, because staying indoors all the time can make you ü§™.
If I had known, I would have gone with you.
On the map, I saw that they were only 3 kilometers away.
I would walk there if I could, but I have to go from Brno)))) I am looking for a convenient route.

We will gladly visit you!
Besides studying at school, what other types of activities would help your child adapt to the Czech environment? (recreation and education)
Okay, if something is found for me, it will be very good.

Do you have any that would work?
Until the age of 21, I studied at the Law Academy in Kharkiv, and then went to work in the prosecutor's office.
My brother is supposed to come to help with the children so that I can go to work.
During the day it was warm, but in the evening a cold wind blew.
Why are you young and probably have many girls?
Everything has its pros and cons.
I have always wanted to visit Prague.
Grishko has already gone to daycare, but not everything is so simple... He is crying very hard.
Today a new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden.
I didn't even touch the door, but it's ringing.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on certain days for as many hours as I can manage.
If that's the case, then I will be able to, for example, work several days a week for several hours.
For how many hours and on which days exactly will I be watching how it turns out for me, so that I can go to fashion and cleaning apartments, as they pay more for cleaning and I don't want to refuse that job.
I am a water supply engineer, so I can immediately taste the water.

But overall, everything is good.
By the way, can I take tests during these days?
I might go live in the evening if they let me go home for the night! You'll see me üòá
There are currently 3 of us (myself and children aged 3 and 17), perhaps later my husband will move in with us, as he is currently staying in a dormitory.
How long do the courses last and what level of language can be expected after completing them?
Great, so I'm free on Monday.
And that would be very good for me.
I will prepare all the materials.
I have a great book where Czech language is taught step by step.
The only time I would really ask for is if it were possible to have 1:00-2:00 pm, because I work until 12:30.
Will it be okay if I manage to get to that place on time?
None that came after the war. None that you didn't think of.
Answer me directly.
Do you want to be with me?
What do you feel about me?
What can I do to convince you?
You can visit there every weekend and not get bored.
Can you tell me how to get to the store?
In the Czech Republic, there are very nice people. I came on vacation to visit my children who are 10 and 15 years old, and my grandmother (who is in Marianske Lazne).
These women are not understood.
We offer free accommodation.
We live in a village in a large family house with a big garden and a closed courtyard between Jihlava and Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod.
We have 2 small children.
We hope for a room.
The kitchen, bathroom, and other rooms are shared.
But first, a month of training that will start on April 13th.
On the website, in the photo there is a television, please ask if it is possible to come today.
He says he's comfortable on the couch, don't worry.
If anything, we'll come up with something.
Thank you very much for your care.
We can meet often.
My husband can bring it to your home tomorrow or on Saturday if it suits you.
No, he didn't call, the guys passed the message along. I know for sure that God is with him.
Okay, then we can go to the playground that's by the river.
Everything has its time. If you don't have a family now, it means that it's not the right time yet. But when you do have one, it will be 10 times bigger and closer than you could have imagined.
I won't be able to download, I have an old phone. I don't speak German ((
I believe that they are looking for a pastry chef who speaks English.
But in order for this document to be printed as I made it, it needs to be first downloaded onto a computer.
It should look like this.
Give us a vacuum cleaner for tomorrow so that we can clean up.
And then you have to ask...it also depends on the weight and size...
Thank you, we already learned something similar.
Everything is good, we went for a walk, I am very tired.
So if no one can come, then there won't be any trouble?
I sent the documents to the email address.
Only in what status did we spend this time together...
There are many thoughts in my head, and I can't hold back.
Can you prepare documents for us - an employment contract?
This robot is big, yellow, and strong. It is thirty-two years old.
I sent a second message to my mom.
Thank you, I need to do some things, but I am no longer able to go anywhere. I need to cook, eat and learn some words. Can we meet tomorrow at 9:30? We are registered for the course at 11 o'clock.
Marina, but really if you need help with the city, my husband and I will help.
Yesterday, my friend and I baked, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
Just now, some woman from DameJidlo called me and said that they had sent me information about further actions to my email, but I didn't respond.
She spoke Czech and I understood her.
But I don't have an email from Dameidlo.
I need small pliers to pull up the gap on the plate.
Type or types of economic activity.
We are looking for a housekeeper for regular cleaning of the house here, in the village.
The proposal is 150 crowns per hour.
Another cooperation according to satisfaction.
You arrange the date with the lady independently.
Of course, but I am distracting you from your train of thought.
Men also have many nuances.
He was a very wealthy person, but I liked him because I had my own point of view on life. I dated him, then left him.
He was a very wealthy person. After some time, he called and informed that he had undergone heart surgery.
Asking me to just talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy person and believed that he could be my toy and that I needed his money.
And then he proposed to me.
There was a car in my yard that looked like a crocodile and it was raining heavily.
And they kept me in the house, then led me to the basement, and there were many people, about 400, there was no air to breathe.
And what about the housing that you sent photos of?
I haven't actually reached there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this fake.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet works normally.
Is there a dress code at work or can you wear whatever you want?
Okay, he will come there and pick them up.
I am not greedy for everything.
I understand that I cannot sit with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the Internet.
A 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propaganda channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened at the bus stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived? Is he okay?
Diana did not respond to me and you.
Okay, I just need to print out coloring pages for the kids. So it will be fine. When can I come?
But maybe you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I am concerned that you are satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian but studies tourism in the Czech Republic.
You really don't want to come for a moment with the children calmly and with grandma.
I want you to be with me. To wake up next to you.
It's generally difficult to be in a foreign country, and with each passing day, the desire to go home grows stronger.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, then I will take a picture of myself.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as good as possible.
I will remember you for the rest of my life.
I will remember and smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you very much, Anna, for mapping the route in the geolocation on the phone so that we could get there faster.
I need to pay the tariff, I must control it.
How can I see how much I am using?
And how do I pay?
I tell her that "the repair of the TV and radio receiver" is delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to say anything unnecessary when they call.
We've been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it's working.
However, in Plyamka (the cat - UP), the fur on the belly and hind legs has come off - this may be due to stress, a change in diet, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but unfortunately, the stress does not depend on me.
"Unlike the mother-in-law, Plamka is not deaf, she hears both sirens and explosions."
Thanks to the fact that Olga has poor hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived with her "incognito" for a month.
On April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polova held a weapon in her hands for the first time in her life.
For 33 days, I lived with her in the apartment like a partisan.
They hid from her both the war and the fact that I was nearby - formally, I came as always for a few hours.
"But when her friend slipped up, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time, the mother-in-law spends in her room.
Having poor hearing allowed me to go unnoticed by her.
If I heard the sound of her "footsteps", I would hide in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the television from her.
Then she called everyone she communicates with. There are 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything, just not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the very beginning until the end.
April 17th is when I clean two apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't think about it :)
Hello, if our help is needed tomorrow, we will be able to come.
Is it necessary to order lunch or can we bring lunch from home? Do I need to print these documents or can I print and sign them on site?
I offer men's, women's, and children's haircuts with home visits. I ask all interested parties to write personal messages. Price:
I understand you and I'm not complaining, but in my situation, I will continue to look here for now.
I'm telling you, the embassy is only here.
The British soldier who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians.
The British soldier, who is a member of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' Marine Infantry Brigade participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Aislin, a British soldier who served in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, with reference to his family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of Aislin's friend who spoke with him.
Literally on Twitter, Aislinn said: "We received word from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army."
We have not run out of food and ammunition.
"Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Eyslin served in the 36th separate marine brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of the military serviceman En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her over the phone that they were planning to surrender as prisoners of war.
Brennan Phillips' military friend also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone conversation, Aislin mentioned their unit's plans for surrender.
According to him, the brigade has run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Aislinn unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order to avoid falling into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
Also, on social media, they shared an audio recording of a phone conversation in which supposedly Aislin talks to her American friend who plans to travel to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eyslin said that they tried to escape the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British man said that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" threatened him on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took an oath.
Eislina's friends and family called him Johnny, but on social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I also want to know. Are we together or not?
But it will not be easy, you will have to find it...
You suggested that I go with you, I agreed if everything is good.
Thank you, we don't need anything else for now, you have already done so much for us and we are very grateful to you.
If you ever don't want to write to me again, I will wait.
Hello Natalia, please water the flowers outside, near the entrance doors. Thank you.
I would like to learn Czech language as well.
I would like you to take a little break and think about yourself.
Today, be sure to apply face cream.
Oh.. I am very grateful to you. I didn't even expect to come across such a person, wishing you health and success!
Is little Dushan not ashamed anymore?
Ondrej and his father came to us.
No one else came in, even though there were many carolers walking on the street.
We are at home today.
The children were studying lessons, now they are playing.
After lunch, I have to go to Lidl to buy groceries.
You have me.
You know that I love you.
I will do everything for you.
How can I prove this to love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove everything to you.
Perhaps you have had many disappointments.
Let me make you happy.
Grandma won't be able to, her legs and hips hurt a lot((
How much does it cost to rent a two-room apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
The family is good, I have my mother, three brothers, and a husband left.
One brother is at war in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizhzhia, and the husband was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call every day and say that everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but I still had some things to take care of. When...
I will ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I needed to talk to Daniel.
The Bolshevik attackers took full revenge for their losses in battle.
Teacher Dmytro Pavlytsky, his unknown relative, and young Boris Oleksiyenko were shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep cesspool, which was filled with earth."
"Behind the memories, there was a dead silence in the city."
Rarely did any of the residents run from house to house in a panic.
Bodies of those killed by Bolsheviks were constantly encountered on the streets.
And maybe I will really go after you. I need you. I can't be without you.
What is your own activity that would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't be able to get there because there is a reconstruction of the railway and the entrance is closed.
When you reach the bridge under reconstruction, let me know that you have arrived and I will come to you.
We have the best future ahead of us.
Lena, can we give the items that didn't fit us to you or should we give them to Kati?
So, I stopped tossing and turning in the middle of the night.
I simply wake up very early in the morning without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4-5 hours, but I am already asleep.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they arrived)) But time is needed, it has to pass.
If I understood correctly, the school will send a letter for login so that we can discuss the menu.
We will try to take us to social services on Tuesday.
Then, when the filling cools down and the dough rises, we shape the pies and fry them on low heat in oil.
Okay, I will definitely ask him.
As soon as we settle in tomorrow evening, I will call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us because it was our last hope, really.
I am not afraid of work because I also lived in a village, so I can and enjoy working physically.
When can I bring you things?
You have a very interesting tradition, we do it for Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the bill 7176, which is titled "On monitoring potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the field of economy".
It is amazing that essentially the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the position held by members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state banks where they hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decisions made by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in hypothetical Kyiv could somehow solve the problems of national security in Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but so far there is no information about any company that needs to physically hold a supervisory board meeting at the location address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it is a great basis for "destroying" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
The one that existed before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill is passed under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may be passed as well - for example, the ProZorro system for state procurement or the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine could be abolished.
Many things can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and the bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to dissolve supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some elected officials for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to demonstrate the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that were used to explain the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
The first deputy minister of economy, Denis Kudin, explained the necessity of such innovation due to the risks of losing internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board may not be able to make necessary decisions, which may result in the company's operations being paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine prevent it?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) prioritize their personal safety over the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And further, most likely, this will lead to a loss of quorum, necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
However, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law requires a competitive selection process, which on average takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by bill 7176 is unlikely to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
People's Deputy and author of the bill, Dmytro Natalukha provides additional arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "Many enterprises, especially those in the defense industry complex (DIC), now require relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom from Vienna."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises in the defense industry that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board exists only in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-gratuitous basis.
The full power in "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the general director, who by the way will make decisions regarding the need to relocate a particular enterprise of the defense industry complex that is part of the concern.
In addition, this argument does not withstand criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises in the military-industrial complex.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to examine some of them: "respected foreign experts, at the first mention of the word "war", still in 2021, leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards of state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war".
Firstly, this is manipulation - the majority of such board members have never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally visited here.
To say that they are "leaving Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in global practice, and in completely different fields: business, education, medicine, and so on.
It is also important to remember that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other occupations, and electronic means of communication precisely help them with this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Because they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a convenient new opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter with a family. I have 2 children with me.

This week I could come on Wednesday, and next week, I think I could also come on Thursday.
So, I understand what needs to be done.
I would also be grateful if you could guide me at the beginning so that I do everything as you need. üòä
We usually require one adult passport from us.
In the Brovary, Vyshhorod, and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshhorodsky, and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!"
Restrictions will be in effect in these cities and villages from 21:00 on April 2nd until 06:00 on April 5th.
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, it is strictly prohibited to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to travel by transport or on foot at this time.
Residents can only go outside when the alarm sounds to go to a shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to eliminate the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine territories.
Omelianyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for now.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, curfew will be in effect daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
Nothing has been sent to me from school yet, only a receipt for payment.

The Serbian defense budget has been increasing in a geometric progression for several years in a row.
Overall, over the past six years, Serbia has invested over two billion euros in modernizing its army, updating military equipment, and acquiring modern systems, rising 22 places in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took very seriously the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.
If you don't mind, I would come.

The regime's security forces detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28 who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signaling system near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of trains.
Source: "Radio Svoboda", human rights center "Viasna", Chief of Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA".
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that three residents of Bobruisk were detained during the night of March 30 with the support of the special forces unit "SOBR", and one of them was injured.
According to "Viasna" data, during the detention, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with medical assistance on site.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Hennadiy Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railways of Belarus will be harshly suppressed" by law enforcement officers using weapons.
On April 6th, it became known that on March 30th, the police had arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, a member of the Baranovichi branch of "BZhD" and an administrator of thematic resources "BZhD" on "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
@belzhd_live reports that his current whereabouts and condition are unknown.
At the end of March, in Belarus, at least 40 railway workers were detained for sabotage.
Let's remind that the formation of BYpol, declared extremist by Lukashenko's regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on railway transport and infrastructure objects within Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "railway partisans" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
As it is known, Russia transfers live forces and equipment through Belarus to wage war in Ukraine.
This is for boosting self-esteem.

And they don't work during Easter holidays in phone mode either?
Can this be done over the phone any day or not?
Even a separate law was adopted regarding this issue.
We traveled here for 4 days, so it was just terrible, not a road.
They were driving through Kyiv region, the city of Irpin, and there was horror there, shooting, sirens.

You have done me a lot of good.
I can do it for free.
Temporarily, while we are looking for a university, we will need permanent residence later, of course.
But maybe she will have a dormitory. (We are looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are not far from Prague now, we have a car and we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
The city or village doesn't matter, it's desirable that it's a separate dwelling.

And I don't understand why the money was taken.

The USA prohibits investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks in Russia, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in the statement on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, while Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
This step is based on the decision made by over 600 multinational companies to exit Russia.
"The private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms," the White House statement said.
The third step of the new sanctions from the USA became restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in critical sectors.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets within the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list will be published by the Ministry of Finance on the following Thursday.
The final part of the package is a complete freeze of assets of Putin's adult children, his wife and daughter, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov's family members, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only drive up to this place, further passage is closed and I will come to you.
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the machine now?
My name is Olga. Before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp Airlines. My mother is a seamstress for industrial products, and my little son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, and didn't even think that we would have to run because we don't have the strength to hide in the basement anymore.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
We hope that someone will take us in for the first time. We can even pay for a room or apartment, but only if it's affordable for us.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We do not have any bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help during such a difficult time for us.
After lunch, I had one English lecture and then went to work in the children's room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents there.
I hope she understood everything and will do everything well.
And also I met Mrs. Lena and we talked with her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the swimming pool.
This is a free swimming.
Can you call the school? Kira is not answering her phone, I don't know if she made it to school.
They are isolating the Russian office: stopping investments and suspending supplies.
But we didn't come to an understanding.
Soldiers did not settle in our house.
Our house is located near a military unit and an oil depot.
He just helped me because I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.
I cook deliciously, don't ask unnecessary questions, and give good advice.
I cope with things myself.
I am struggling a bit, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
We'll meet on Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
Overall, everything is good.
I walk, how often do you clean up?
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have the program, but I will try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls cannot move anywhere right now, so I have not written to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear any information about housing, you will let me know.
I would happily rent accommodation with some decent girl.
If you can know such, let me know.
On my part - I won't let you down.
Thank you in advance.
Natalia, who is 54 years old, has not written to you yet. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, as they contain all the information.
I didn't change my last name, it's been the same since birth :)
Good day Mr. Reirard! I'm sorry I didn't see it. I'll do it now and send it to you right away.
We are now going for a medical examination.
So Ani needs to make up this hour on another day.
On which day is it better for her to come earlier? (Maybe on a day with a little more work?)
Tomorrow I will finish listening, the Internet is working poorly. Good night.
What are you going to do now?
Thank you.. we found some things, but there was nothing from the equipment...
Both beginners, besides the alphabet, know nothing.
Nothing is happening.
Is it possible on Monday, April 25th?
Children can be taken with you, there are plenty of toys here :)
She guessed about dad.
Probably, I am very naive or very in love, but I will come up with something to do with this money.
We will somehow do it.
But how will it be paid for, please, no credits.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do we need to bring the clothes they gave us?
Today is not my day. The blinds in the living room broke. One in the morning and another one now in the evening.
Something came from you, I don't see what.
I am also very sad.
I will remind you about the texture later.
Do only your father speak and understand Russian?
On which day does the colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm sorry for distracting you from your work.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There's news from Mariupol about my son - he's alive and in good shape.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
Journalist of TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was given to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and there are many wounded.
They said that "the clock is ticking".
Before this, on April 11th, the 36th separate marine brigade, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in the Russian language.
The statement mentioned that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not communicate with the fighters for two weeks.
On social media, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, assured that there is communication between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons near the "Azovstal" plant, which is held by the soldiers of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good.
The situation is the same, for now we are staying here.
2 hours of driving for a walk, mom to the stores and back!
It's not an important matter.
She forgot what to do here.
The squadron of Czechüá®üáø drones began flights over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional drones üöÅ will serve for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy aggressor üí•.
Two brothers from Transcarpathia and two brothers from the Czech Republic, known as "birds," were sent to Ukraine by Mukachevo City Council deputy Volodymyr Labutenko two days ago.
Today, their friends from the mountains, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities where combat operations are currently taking place received them.
In order to ensure the maximum efficiency and safety of using drones, we will keep their locations secret for now.
Four friends from the Czech Republic who are helping the Ukrainian army have no plans to stop and say that in the coming days they will send many interesting "gifts" to Ukraine that will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them.
I'm worried that we won't make it. We have a lot of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine to continue working.
Okay. If everything is fine, I will agree.
I will try to do it myself, but if any problems arise, may I write to you?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We personally visited the head of the village in Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing available.
Perhaps she will be happy and her mood will improve.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I also got cold outside.
I took medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critically.
I'm sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I'm curious about your musical accomplishments üòä
You should listen to mom and dad.
You will find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and rainy here. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But it's not the ruined buildings that are a pity, it's the people who are being humiliated by the occupiers.
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial on Perekopska Street in Kherson.
Details: It is noted that unknown individuals tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those who died in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They lowered the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the carol, we don't have such a tradition, so we didn't know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, maybe we should have given them something else.
In Czech, there is someone to talk to if needed.
Because I live in a dormitory, there will be people here until twelve, and then they go to work.
Hello, feeling a little better now.
Today he has already been to the manger.
Even today he has already slept there.
We have already made great progress.
I will definitely bring varenyky next time!
Today I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I am repelled by the days and times when there is work to clean apartments after guests, I can approximately say it is in the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I will be able to roughly say at the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you have anything to say about it.
Hello, sorry for not replying for a long time, I was cooking dinner and took a nap.
"If you don't mind, could I come today?"
Or we will meet after your arrival.
He is modest and has been studying a lot lately. He realized that it is very necessary for him in life.
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I am working with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the highlands region's economics department.
She was very satisfied with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the nursery.
I have to bring confirmation of employment and cash payment for the nursery on Monday.
I am lazy since Friday.
I'm not doing anything, just eating a lot and sleeping üòÇ (and drinking a lot of water ‚òùüèª)
"If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you if it's possible."
I have to bring one more analysis.
So there won't be a need to go again.
The drain tank is working very poorly, it doesn't flush well. A master is needed. It needs to be fixed.
So there is enough of everything there.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you have signed up for.
Do they feed children there or do we need to bring our own food?
And now, can I ask you one question?
If you still need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't really want you to collect money so that people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, two points were not enough for me.
I will go to rest. To gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Goodnight.
üòÑüòçWhat a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will be painting.
Karazin University calls on employees and students to carefully verify any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Rely only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army.
I gathered several works for my portfolio.
After the holidays, they are supposed to have internet installed.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will they count the day I was absent from work if I have a pass?
Staff briefing: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine.
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
"Armed forces of the Russian Federation may carry out provocative actions in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for actions on the Sloboda direction.
It is likely that in the coming days, the occupiers will attempt to resume their offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons, and equipment to participate in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate motorized infantry brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th general army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the mentioned weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to replenish the personnel losses of the units of the battalion tactical group, recruitment of military personnel from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th combined-arms army of the Eastern Military District is carried out.
The enemy experiences a particular problem when selecting positions for drivers and driver-mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy will continue to strike at transportation infrastructure objects in Ukraine in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the combat zones, with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Sloboda direction, separate units from the 6th General Military Army and the coastal forces of the Northern Fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
Aerial reconnaissance of the area along the Izyum direction is ongoing with the aim of detecting the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
With the forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy attempted to launch an attack towards the populated areas of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to concentrate its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted to carry out assault operations in the area of Zolote, but was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue their assault actions in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport with the help of artillery and aviation.
With the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopyllia, Trudoliubivka, and Marianske.
Defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six units of automotive equipment, and eight enemy artillery systems in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions over the past day.
Did I not understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it on time, but I doubt it.
And how can you sleep if I keep you up?
Are you definitely not against me coming?
If you simply don't feel like meeting today, just tell me, I'll understand everything.
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home, especially not 1+1. There's no need to set it up for us :)
I turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language.
My monthly tariff package ends today :)
Can we do this over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads.
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I will ask her. I feel a little embarrassed to ask because she already gives us so many pies.
We will definitely meet up with my father later üôèüèª
I read the announcement on Facebook, so Google probably wrote something in their own way üèµÔ∏è. I think the phone numbers are enough.
Good day, we have taken the things you brought, but there are some things that are too small for us. Can you bring them in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director approves, then I can start working from next week because tomorrow before noon I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if I manage to, because there are very long queues) and it's raining on Saturday :)
I am looking for a team to start with, I really liked chemistry in school, I am learning Czech language to know it perfectly, and I dream of working at T√©va.
Friends old and not very close, friends whom I haven't met personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have also come to you.
During the last month, I have communicated with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy to begin with, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feeling guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Through what they subject Ukraine to in your name.
Some of you activists have long been under threat, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
"I'll tell you a little later," Sasha replied laconically as usual. "Right now we're walking through the ruins after the search."
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", "Novaya Gazeta", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organization and a number of other places - how many of you have done anything to resist this regime?
Except for possibly participating in protests when they were still happening.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to be silent".
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstractions?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which now, probably, weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
It was not always like this.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy - chaotic and even bloody, but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up being so afraid of chaos that you seek salvation behind the back of the king, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you went to the monument of Dzerzhinsky and allowed the KGB to lie dormant, renew, reform, and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly resigned yourself to the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you either voted for it or gave preference not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kali, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends, I would return to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about murdered children, about soldiers who sold the bodies of the deceased to their families.
You told me, "Breda, we're already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was outraged: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya."
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
"This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-2000s, caused by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started earning well, some have become rich, and even the poorest among you have acquired new housing and found better jobs.
Prices were rising, but is that really a problem?
Moscow shone and sparkled festively with luxury.
When several opposition members were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, the matter did not progress further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev and took the position of prime minister himself, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or remained silent about it.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we probably didn't do much in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little bit of outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when there is such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin swapped places with Medvedev again and took the presidential seat as before, many of you decided that enough was enough and you went out to protest en masse.
Navalny's name became a nickname, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some people received huge deadlines.
"And what could we have done?"
I felt it so often and still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once captured Maidan - and never left it again.
They completely independently built a tent city and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to demolish it, they started to defend themselves using sticks, reinforcement bars, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters turned to attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose their leaders and to drive them out if they do a bad job.
Putin did not like Maidan very much.
This was a bad example.
Taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, however there was little benefit from it.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly a new myth was born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find the reason because we stopped communicating right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly remained silent.
"You said, 'We are not interested in politics'."
And you hid in new books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks, all looking brand new after the restoration initiated by the Moscow mayor in 2012 - with their jogging paths, public Wi-Fi, and hipster cafes.
Honestly, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
IDIL or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because supposedly I didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there myself and saw how state snipers cold-bloodedly shoot my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers were there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
At first, they came through the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the trade unions, but I remained silent - because I am not a member of a trade union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense.
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did this.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are really speaking now - like, for example, Dmytro Hlukhovsky, Mykhailo Shyshkin, Mykhailo Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from within the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking being sent to a new Gulag or joining Navalny's company.
As for others, you know best in which country you live.
Therefore, I am confident that you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he fails to do so, he will turn his attention to you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went out to protests and have served a short term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
Out of thousands of you who signed petitions, expressed disagreement on social media (even if it was just with a black square on Instagram), or spoke up in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke are not so far in the past - and now they are likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak up for you then? Who will be left behind?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And no matter how overwhelming his advantage may be on paper, his intelligence, motivation, and courage can stop him.
Considering everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on in general.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read international news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows that you know.
Therefore, be prepared.
You understand where everything is heading.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a farce, your laws, if not considering repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media outlets are gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you have no more credit cards to buy a ticket for a flight abroad, even if some flights are still available.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement, your submission.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to leave somehow or you will be disappointed.
I doubt that you see any other option.
And yet there remains one more.
Which will finally bring down this regime.
I may need less from you than you think, given the circumstances.
Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: due to the impending economic collapse in Russia, it is most likely to ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and is much more afraid of these people than he is of intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city will hold protests on its own, as it has already periodically happened, it will be easy to suppress them individually.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet, which may have limitations, but still works and can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was crushed, but it is possible to create others that are more informal and decentralized.
You are very many, you are millions.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, maybe even a hundred thousand.
If it exceeds 300,000, she will be shocked.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After everything he made them go through in Ukraine, everything he forced them to endure?
Of course, the danger will be very high.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
If I were in your place, I would be afraid too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but actually try to achieve it.
But even if you do nothing, countless lives will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a Syrian cell under police batons.
Here's what has been happening for many years - and will only continue to intensify, gaining larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically, and achieve that it becomes a reality.
We were at the lesson on Friday and were told that we can come on Monday.
In the evening we will be at home.
What do you perceive me as, a press secretary?
Viko, how often do you go to an expensive restaurant for dinner?
Once a year, I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner.
I will try to explain everything to her.
We liked it very much and wanted something shinier, so this is the best option.
I was in a room with many people. I became energetically tired.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, lost voice, weakness, and dizzy head.
I have to go to that government job.
We have already done it, but we said that those who registered in April will receive the money only at the end of the month.
We need a pass for Thursday, we are taking the children to the doctor.
But last night, a lady wrote to me who liked your work and she wanted something from you at her house.
I am waiting for her latest news and will definitely inform you.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex, psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity to lose time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I am monogamous and take marriage matters seriously.
There was a man whom I was supposed to marry, but he died due to heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people should love, respect, and trust each other.
Currently, I haven't met anyone like that.
Good day. Where in Yihlava can I buy forms for baking Easter bread (paper or silicone)?
Okay, thank you for the advice, I will now add my certificate for Valya to the application.
She has cerebral palsy and is lying down, her leg is currently in a cast, her wheelchair is in a reclined position, and all her food is blended in a blender.
Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry for bothering you during non-working hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to the game room today to say hello to Natali.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to pick up her child, saying that she came to look at things and arrange them in the room with clothes, and Mr. Valeriy opened our children's room for her until 7:00 pm yesterday.
Is it really possible?
The working hours of the room are until 4:00 PM.
And finally, this is our responsibility.
But I can't load or open the page because my internet is very weak.
Good day, everything is good with us. Kolya is working, yesterday we filled out invitations, and I was helping the older ones prepare for the gymnasium exam.
The hardest thing right now is to understand the geometry tasks.
On Saturday, Volodymyr helped us.
Vika is studying universities and high school programs.
Can we afford to pay for the apartment and utilities?
We are very grateful for the accommodation.
So, but I thought you didn't fill it out.
We will try to collect the maximum amount by the end of the week in order to settle the payment.
The situation regarding the Russian invasion - briefing by the advisor to the head of the Office of the President, Oleksiy Arestovych (10.04.2022)
The advisor to the head of the President's Office told about the heroic act of a senior officer of the border troops in Mariupol - he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with a radio station so that it would not fall into the hands of the enemy.
I have a very important question, will they help me register my granddaughter who is 5 years old (with bronchial asthma)? She has a runny nose and wheezing right now.
We need a family doctor for her who will understand a little Ukrainian or Russian language.
We urgently need a doctor's consultation, we are very worried about her condition.
We live in Doln√≠ Chabry, Czech Republic. We need a doctor who is located either here in Doln√≠ Chabry or somewhere nearby, possibly in Brno but not far from the metro, so that we can reach them.
I really liked the butterfly exhibition.
Butterflies landed on the children's hands and feet.
How is your day?
"Lord, what a cool little garden! I am so grateful to you, there are no words, thank you very much. Vlad really liked it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Mom has been standing there since 4 in the morning.
Perhaps the hostess could leave her phone for communication.
For now, this house in Prague 8 seems like the best option to me.
The director did not tell me anything about the possibility of sponsoring the child's lunch payments.
They gave me this information for payment.
For part of March and for April, I have already paid for meals.
If you had the opportunity, could you help me pay for May and June?
What do I need to do?
Should I address this issue to the school principal?
"Is it better to come on Mondays or on Wednesdays?"
All your friends will know that you are communicating with me.
I don't know what to do, I need housing soon but there is no housing available.
Did you end the relationship or were you left first?
I come from Donetsk region, have a medical education, 27 years of experience, work in a neurological department, do massages, therapeutic exercises for adults and children, and love medical manipulations. I speak Russian and Ukrainian languages. For more information, please call +420-464-548-072 or write on Viber +380-42-791-0436.
I was a manicurist üò•, and my friend was a manager.
But we know how to do everything, we are Ukrainians, and what we don't know, we learn quickly)))
I wish you to find a good assistant üòä
I somehow thought that today is Monday.
Can I ask you to take me with you when you go home?
I need a nightstand. I can pay for the rent.
I don't know what to do.
We need to periodically go to the embassy, I am waiting for when they can process the documents, I go and ask. I will keep looking here.
Moreover, I am interested in communicating with you.
