The big return of the Czech jinx is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon also get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk got injured during the preparation for NHL in October of this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game against Vegas, he was substituted and since then he has not appeared on NHL ice rinks.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to another.
"The Denver team announced in early October that Pavel Francouz will be out with an injury to the lower part of his body for approximately three to four weeks."
His return to the NHL goal eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was called from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
V AHL recorded 94.5% of interventions.
The product of Pilsen hockey wants to finally make a name for himself and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last academic year, he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic year, he did not play a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, his save percentage is at 92.3%.
Charles puts on a mask in his Christmas greeting, while William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas greeting.
Prince Charles also published his wish, using a photograph in which he helps his wife Camilla put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported it on their website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt, just like Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not disclose who took the photograph, and it is not clear when exactly it was taken.
The royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The photo, which will serve as a Christmas greeting, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat on his head and a mask on his face, is helping Camille put on her mask that matches the color of her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Detectives allegedly worked with the assumption that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, had been promised one million Czech crowns by Prague Slavia for winning the league title in the 2018/19 season in the current corruption case.
The website efotbal.cz reported that they had gained access to a portion of police files.
The chairman of the board of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and white team did not engage in any corrupt behavior.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps in which the former sports director of Slavia, Jan Nezmar, features prominently. Nezmar left the championship club last summer.
According to the document, a former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the second league team Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Detectives allegedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
"The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million bribe by officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, quoted from the file by the server."
Later that day, according to detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia, Tvrdík.
According to the file, it is not clear whether the police are still dealing with this information, according to the server.
Tvrdík refused any corrupt behavior.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
"We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial benefits to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the backstage, among other things, Nezmar insults some former Slavia players with dark skin in a very rude way and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
Last year in mid-October, a police operation was launched in several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, in connection with the alleged match-fixing case involving referees.
The highest-ranking person in the scandal is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football positions.
In mid-January, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and APCs are the larping of the Cold War.
The cannons will be new, but fundamentally of a worse type (artillerymen will have to operate them from an armored cabin and manually carry ammunition without any cover).
The Toyota Hi-Lux cars are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Airplanes: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential.
Rockets - we don't have any at all (but we produce and export them abroad).
PVO: medium - Cold War era, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
"I have such a story."
Honitbu is right next to the city.
Nutrias were crawling out of the river and causing damage to crops, so I went there to sit down.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to cause a disturbance, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I thought she would leave before anything came out, but of course the fox went out soon.
I let her come within 40 meters before deciding to shoot.
"Poor fisherman almost crapped himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him, it was a close call."
Before I got off the stand, it was gone.
That means "I think the guy is a loser."
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of many factors for something to happen, you would probably be seen on thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So put expensive things visibly at your feet in the sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Internally, we found respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state responsible for purchasing and distributing masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks on their acquisition.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day, the amounts spent on respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities acted economically?
And why did others shop more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army, which older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't have large warehouses of equipment that trained personnel could use, we don't actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, and furthermore modern technology is constantly becoming more complex, so the abilities of backup personnel will rapidly decline over time.
In addition to modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, they will take place very quickly and there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reserves/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is necessary to conduct mass guerrilla warfare and it is also a pronounced necessity for deterring the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only succeed in a conflict of such scale and intensity where guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have suitable geography for that.
Mainly, we don't have individual skill.
And that's not the worst part.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they owned it.
Then situations arise where you look like a cool guy who, just 2 minutes ago, missed an empty goal, and now you're attacking alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players, and you're thinking to yourself, "What the hell do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they will choose him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "beating the defender" is so bad that I caught myself being honestly surprised when I see our attacker manage to outplay one opponent player.
"First swallows"
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts do not expect any significant turn of events in the following weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure in hospitals will continue for some time and a new unknown variable has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the COVID equations this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon he should also be supplemented with the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent from previous results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the forefront because the drug had been in development long before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral diseases in horses on the South American continent.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "as if our beak grew".
You conduct research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you "no" without hesitation.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
And they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and being subjected to media lynching.
The package looks nice in the surveys, the west is good, the east is bad.
But he really finds out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20% according to a survey.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to learn where everything is again, all objects are exactly the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or because of the more western location.
Only the warheads, not the entire rockets as is often said, were stored in those underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree).
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Apart from that maple tree, the rest are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Romani classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed off too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often walked around and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, and he dressed cleanly.
He also went on school trips, did various pranks, but he was okay, maybe never got into any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings who were Roma joined the same year group but different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and endangered other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something through classified ads (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Roma people, they always had the money, didn't try to negotiate the price, and communication was calm.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called after a month saying he had already transferred it to his name.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other color, as long as they behave in a way that is appropriate in decent society (works, functions, doesn't hit women, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes, stretches out their hand, occupies apartments and houses, has only disorder around them, causes problems.. then it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, as long as they get involved, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily just English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it doesn't matter to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs too.
A young woman died in a car accident in the Prachatice region.
"A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot despite resuscitation care," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian emergency medical services, to Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was carrying a girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving from the village of Žíchovec towards the village of Bavorov when, for reasons yet unknown, he drove into the opposite lane in a curve.
"After colliding with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident spokesperson for the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová."
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was multiple injuries and he remained trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was transported by air to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, stated rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was transported to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, and customers often do not provide the necessary information.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars and up, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan where postage is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, as he now has to add VAT and provide information to the post office for customs clearance.
He receives an email with a message that customs officials are expecting the arrival of a package.
It is enough to fill in the details about the shipment, and if the merchant did not include VAT during the sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and transportation.
In case the recipient does not arrange the customs procedure themselves, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I will click on one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and it's done.
"For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes," says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are successfully delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of packages received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, an additional problem is also that people do not respond to requests for information necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
"If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be about halfway there," said Matyáš Vitík, a spokesperson for the Czech Post.
Solution to inflation.
As for the title, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we have a 9.9% inflation rate and its further increase is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and basic necessities in Poland, is this a path for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and in my opinion, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much extra did you get (if you are an employee)?
This year, they added 2% to my gross income, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from my business that I operate while employed.
Would someone be able to explain to me why proven violent offenders are sometimes only sent to prison for 6 months?
My head just can't wrap around how a court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months, just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual and overall relationships.
Not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it either.
Will this not deter potential future reports of rape victims?
The man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrob unintentionally helped the guards to apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had actually called her himself.
He went for it, but took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After being called to the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and were surprised when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up just to get the guards to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the guards for advice on how to report to the Czech Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found out that the woman is on the list of wanted persons in a nationwide search, and there is a warrant for her arrest.
The case is being handled by the Czech Police.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally distinct, but I am interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague for the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can truly believe in something without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, as there are approximately, if I'm not mistaken, around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose then?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions, there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it states that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risking choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and being sent to hell or some similar place by the one true god that I happened to miss?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is apparently similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months in one) under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person performs well, they can receive a professional offer.
All components of the Czech Armed Forces would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can speak like this: There is a constant discussion about cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are scouting in schools and there is a kind of overlap where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, transitioning from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or even Mongol invaders will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is trouble.
This sentence is not in a recognizable language.
Just one election in the USA that will screw up their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell.
The English translation of this sentence is: The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has been functioning as a guarantee of independence in the long term is a heavily armed army and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of their time.
And today every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so why wouldn't it be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, that's outdated, but a skilled teenager with a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami.
Do you unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find yourself at home buried in boxes and packing materials?
E-shops reuse this "waste" when they lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores that welcome your used boxes was created.
And not just during Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains nearly 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as saved money, as the packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am additionally strengthening my brand.
One of such stores is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-friendly toiletries and cosmetics.
Individuals bring us boxes and packing material to Popůvky near Brno, which they accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular pickups of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
"Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauties of nature for future generations," says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz not only shows collection points for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to dispose of expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
The total project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs, and other places are added to it, which help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the Ukliďme Česko application.
I rather feel bad that nowadays technology is so easy and foolproof that children who use computers or phones play games on them, but don't learn basic computer skills while doing so.
Recently, a problem has emerged (especially in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying file system with folders and throw everything onto one screen in the application.
They can use technology from childhood, but most importantly, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU, which begins in January, before the weekend and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the streets - and mentioned so many actions that cannot be accomplished in half a year.
But French politicians like it and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters who straddle the line between left and right agree on very little, but they do agree on Europe.
In France, there will be new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize that Macron is promoting pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right candidate for French president Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the message that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is having some success with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea for a history textbook seriously and not pay attention to what's happening in France.
Was it not necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, and Czechs are finding out who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't find out what the broader context of the event was.

I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu or being constipated. For a few days, I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
Only a personal experience. I'm not claiming that everyone has the same experience.

Trains start running according to a new timetable, some transport companies will change.
Trains will start running according to a new timetable on Sunday on the railway.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts operating instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, and occasionally their route is slightly modified.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Transport companies started selling tickets already during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections per day in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
Besides domestic connections within the new timetable, trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main news will be the InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The next new trains of the carrier will operate in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the fares from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník, Nymburk, and Kolín.
After winning the competition organized by the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will replace Czech Railways here.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections daily on the track, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express has kept its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also the weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlářík, the carrier tried to maintain as similar as possible departure times for its long-distance trains despite planned track maintenance work.
The operation of trains by Arriva and other carriers should continue without major changes.
Carriers will also be replaced on some regional routes.
Changes are expected for passengers, for example in Českolipsko, where trains of the German company Die Länderbahn's Trilex will operate instead of Czech Railways on the route from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a unified fare on the railway for the second year.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Don't we learn to see the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear about how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, and even died.
In my life, I have never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave-owning side or from that time, nobody defends this, only condemns it.
No one will tell you in schools that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from Native Americans, they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans exterminated them, even though they had been killing each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't personally encountered anyone intentionally concealing facts, but I have heard before that it happens and I believe it's a problem, which I don't deny (for example, war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective without understanding it.
History does not care about anyone's feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without considering the context of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, since we're talking about the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there. On the other hand, they also had some good achievements and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better than many people idealize it to be nowadays.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South were slave owners and many things were also repugnant to them.
I wouldn't compare this to Russia, as they intentionally omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, and moreover, our perspective doesn't even exist for them (there was even a video on YouTube where someone was turned off on TV for talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I felt that at some universities it was terrible, those students were quite radicalized and those schools often supported them in it.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a little sick at the thought that this could be the voice of the majority, because it exists among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to and it's not about the same thing anymore, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are being labeled as feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalization even on the opposite side, often resulting in resistance even to fairly reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I have also not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I guess I met with bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't achieve on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
If something connects me with people, it's interests, views on the world, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer anymore, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
This Slovak priest is a really cool guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always messes up with some nonsense about coronavirus that makes everyone embarrassed.
Of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church is also here.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they originated from Catholic modernism and are effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics but attend services with the Hussites because it is very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominikánské Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even hold a Latin mass there every Sunday at 3:00 pm, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem Flame is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it over from Austria.
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts went to pick him up due to the coronavirus pandemic, but even this time they did not go to Vienna. In the morning, he was picked up by his Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
They took over her at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that our group participates in every year, and I am really looking forward to it.
"It is an honor for me to have been chosen," said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, this year it will take place at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, scouts travel by train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes in the distribution of the flame throughout the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off by train with the Bethlehem light first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, the delivery of light will be taken care of by scout couriers who will travel on selected express and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, and then they will continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where railways do not lead.
This year, scouts must adhere to current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's happening similarly to last year.
"We give recommendations to both courier teams and organizers of local events to naturally wear masks, try to maintain distance, be as few as possible, not sing with colleagues, simply behave in a way that is as safe as possible," said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope and light that overcomes darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (such as water retention), healthcare, and education will make proper use of those funds, but I don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry, and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is being produced, which undermines the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is simply being artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is hindering development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolute agreement, it's terrible.
Even a person who was born in the internet age sometimes falls for some trick or trap - especially advertisements.
I myself think that internet ads don't affect me, but then I still get caught and realize that they have influenced me too - it's just so sophisticated that a person can't always resist it.
For that reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic (targeted) advertising.
"It's all garbage, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet."
I have a feeling that this belief has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
"I will not believe in something that the majority believes and makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe in something that is less likely, doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion which I will argue is critical thinking."
"I certainly won't believe everything the media says."
"I don't trust politicians."
Television has lost the trend of Christmas movies, there are two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles - Chinese television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record-breaking more than two hundred to their viewers.
It was calculated by the operator of the movie database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been gaining popularity among audiences in recent years, leading to a significant increase in viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only included movies with the word Christmas in their title in its count, so there are actually many more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, while globally popular films such as Home Alone, Heaven Can Wait, or the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946 are also popular.
The real boom of Christmas movies, however, started only in 2009 when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series, as reminded by the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas, which included four movies, was very successful at the time.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas as early as October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas movies.
The competitive station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the overall total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter as much, what's important is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described this genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we have been living in for the past few years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark channel uses the same recipe for their movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then some misunderstanding arises about half an hour before the end, which is successfully resolved and those two kiss.
"That's how it goes round and round, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch them one after another," Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will start the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will only send one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to aim for a better position than the 20th place he earned in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will ultimately not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was indeed tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the back and Max Verstappen starting from the front, who will compete in a direct battle for the title against Lewis Hamilton.
According to the statement from the Haas team, Mazepin is relatively fine and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
"Now she is in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas cannot and will not send a substitute driver to the race.
A potential substitute would have to complete a qualification or races in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not encountering COVID-19.
At the start of the just-ended season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
For this, they can also lock you up.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will shock you!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all their savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but I had little experience. Sweaters were never really worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours working on his project over the course of six months."
Silk was bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads were bought in France, and Swarovski provided 2000 decorative crystals.
Then he decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator of his work, which he does not recommend washing.
But there is one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I need to sell my sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

About the situation in the USA with a leading African American reporter.
New cases of police violence are coming to light in the United States, this time during interventions at nationwide protests.
The demonstrations that erupted after the police officer killed African American George Floyd during his arrest opened up a debate about systematic racism, police work, and cases of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to one of the leading African American journalists, The Atlantic magazine reporter Adam Serwer.
But what would increase the funding?
The Union is stuffing money into us through subsidies.
If it stops doing that, we will stop having that money.
I really don't see how the fact that the union stops giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to assist Poland.
Engineers, explorers, and drone pilots could set out before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiena is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion reported for this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class."
"Ciupek stated that direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov primary school has not been proven."
Six cases appeared in the region during the week.
"The official confirmation of the variant in our six cases is still pending - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that it concerns two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, and four have an asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad.
None of those mentioned traveled abroad, nor did anyone from their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who was staying abroad.
"There is no connection to the water polo championship among any of the listed individuals," stated Ciupek.
The Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament, which took place in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa on him and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict the sale of firearms.
"I want to follow Texas' lead in banning abortions."
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous American state, using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's statement from the US Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas abortion ban, despite going against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion universally across the US up to approximately the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on a technical issue that arises from the innovative construction of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public in this case, which made it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal process.
"The California governor stated, 'I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law.'"
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are informally referred to as homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "citizens' privacy" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and legal expenses from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, "ghost gun" components or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," said the California governor.
The AP agency reports that California has banned the production and sale of certain military-style weapons for a decade, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, who warned in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict against the expansion of the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant complete immunity to the Texas abortion ban from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials in the southern United States.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, during which the vaccination scheme is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, in Israel, studies on the effects of 4 doses are already rolling in large numbers.
According to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Simply like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for that now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should come to the market, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.
You can safely leave the amount of material.

How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
At home, we have Netbox and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think that O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change my TV and internet provider.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act unlawfully if it used its new powers to suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the use of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
She is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism allowing for the withdrawal of EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
"It would be justifiable considering that the EU unlawfully denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute," added the Polish minister.
His party takes more radical positions on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system underwent during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
"Ziobro also said that Warsaw is facing a 'political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles'."
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on partnership between sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party will never agree to such concessions from Brussels that would result in Poland's sovereignty being limited.
"He declared that we will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony."
But to figure it out... At our Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I also came across one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy section I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common, and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and lactose-free zone...
If I avoid it, I won't step foot in any market, sale or no sale. The gold shop on the square may not have as much selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's organized, so I can get everything done in ten minutes.
I am taking a vacation from Lidl.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I have been watching how data is being handled here like manure, most opponents of vaccination are just slightly more off the mark than most advocates of vaccination.
Although rational discussion is taking place at a professional level, only extreme opinions are making their way into the public sphere.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This is how the state has it and this is how we have it.
But nobody is addressing the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states.
Well, I feel relieved now.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
They punished me with a wooden spoon when I was a child.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just because I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (reading instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a hit (sometimes even after catching me again, she just brought a spoon and put it down so I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen did I receive a few spanks on the bottom (over my clothes).
Personally, I believe that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than to words.
According to me, the important part is the warning because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and receive punishment or improve their behavior and avoid punishment.
In the end, usually just a warning was enough for me to start listening.
Defense of the system.
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl was asked by a journalist in 1999 what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document that one swears by and learns about in school from an early age, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save changes.
And imagine this: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at that time.
However, recently, the opinion has been increasingly expressed among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
The show is being tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have predicted, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The institution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing the majority of crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governance order consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we restrict politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, several-month-old baby fights for its life in the Brno hospital.
Although it is known that the coronavirus is usually milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with, especially recently.
"We know that children are less endangered and affected than adults, with 2 to 5 percent being talked about in comparison to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually significantly simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
"But there are pediatric patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic for pediatric infectious diseases.
Truly very seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been in the ICU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously treated on the ward throughout the entire year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, which means inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay in the resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and even several-month-old babies.
Even children in critical condition due to coronavirus are present in hospitals.
"The head physician stated that we currently have a child of several months and adolescent age lying with us."
However, he is happy that so far no child deaths from coronavirus have been recorded at the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years old died in the Czech Republic by December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist's collaboration is an integral part of the children's hospital, not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that just like in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and simultaneously reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"The doctor added that we also recommend the application of vaccination doses in children."
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on designated paths.
But the peace zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside of the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/riding a bike in the forest off the marked trail is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course, it's not really monitored outside of national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
"Music is playing in my head," Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He was trained by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor, he works not only at the F. Šaldy Theatre in Liberec but also, for example, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre in Pilsen.
He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Sub-Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having successfully managed the pandemic and that its authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of having mastered the pandemic and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched both a healthcare and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing faced criticism for failing to stop the outbreak that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected cases.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against coronavirus in many places, such as the hardest-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets another friend and says to him: "Hey, do you want an elephant?"
I have him and he's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with the hose, and plays with the children.
Well, it's just great.
If you want it for 5000,-, I will sell you the little elephant.
Friend: Alright, let's give each other a high five, that will be great...
After some time, they meet and the one who bought it complains: "Dude, what did you sell me? An elephant??"
The lawn is trampled, there are huge piles of dung everywhere, the car is broken down, the children are afraid of him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: You speak badly about the little elephant, you won't sell him like that...
The world affairs are dominated by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
It currently functions at an economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, moods will be different and it will work out.
It occurred to me and it's quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I may be nitpicking.
I am only assuming that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is no longer clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces," including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just nitpicking :D
Whether it is so or not, it is an absurd demand.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey named Milly.
Terrifying footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her away and laughed at her.
Holland also fed the monkey with hot dogs, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates' Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
Experts in monkey rehabilitation, who are taking care of Milly after her abuse, stated that they have never seen a frightened monkey like her before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and now happily plays again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A quadruple mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrates' Court in Gwent, she was sentenced to twelve weeks' imprisonment with a suspended sentence for one year.
Hollandova was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifelong ban on animal breeding, and must pay court costs of 12,000 Czech crowns.
Steph Sawyer, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said, "Milly is okay, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The little monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Now, even though she has settled down and is content with her mate, the sight of new people can still trigger panic in her.
"Psychological scars from the abuse will haunt her forever," adds Sawyer.
Milly's torture came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on her phone during a raid on her apartment for drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Hollandova offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers for me.
In May, she admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it, along with her partner Russell Cox (43).
Cocaine worth 1600 pounds (equivalent to just under 50,000 Czech crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs was found in her house.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric era three times in a row, when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Do you really take the same things to school in first grade as you do in sixth grade?

The main thing is to get an A on the test, and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can handle determining the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority doesn't even flinch and will tell you that they don't give a damn.
So what the fuck is he/she learning for?
I am a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want it and don't feel the need for it.
At that moment, it's pointless and you'll never get through to them anyway.
Partially, it is learned for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But seriously, I meant that you really don't need all of this while standing at the machine...because you simply don't need it.
Moreover, we are slowly entering a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
However, the price of having barbarians standing next to us at those machines is simply too high, which is probably also influenced by our communist past and incitement against intellectuals and elites.
If journalists could count, then COVID probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrea continues!
"That is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," Andrea replied on Instagram Stories to curious questions from fans about what disappointed her about Kadri so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Between Kadrim and Andreou, there was friction from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She resolutely refused it.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only didn't end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
"It was a planned attack by you!" Kadri retorted angrily in response to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty did not appeal to his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't express myself about these things at all, and even in my family, we never really talked about these things much.
I definitely don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to harm and tarnish the name of someone I love so much in public, I just can't stand it!
I am sorry that I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself into a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
I am even more sorry when I have to read such untrue information that is probably taken out of context.
I really wish everyone could know Kadri like I do, our close ones and family are standing in confession in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
"Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was," she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao began his robbery expedition in the parking lot of a residential area, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 Czech crowns from one vehicle.
Then he didn't come up with anything better than climbing up to the 5th floor and sneaking into the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
In the footage from a security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he realized that the bananas were not where they had been and called the police.
Subsequently, Cchaa detained us.
The man admitted that he had consumed some alcohol on the incriminated day.
Due to needing money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole matter is currently under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic state of emergency.
When it is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business.
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters participated in Saturday's elections for the municipal councils of four municipalities.
New municipal councils were elected by people on Saturday in the villages of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number established by law or the elected councils have disintegrated.
On Saturday, 99 candidates competed for a total of 28 mandates.
The average age of newly elected councilors is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a fairly demanding but successful year for us.
"Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and especially highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it," said the Vice-Chair of the Czech Statistical Office, Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In the Uherské Hradiště district, the Independent Candidates Association won the Saturday elections, receiving 27.76% of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52% of the voters giving them their vote.
The former mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníci party, also regained her seat in the council.
The Komňané - independent candidates - have achieved one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It gained 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have made it to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lužice and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John won the repeated elections in Lužice in Mostecko.
It gained 56.73 percent of the votes and, just like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second place was taken by the candidate list "Obec pro lid", which received 43.27 percent of the votes, and will therefore have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the urns.
Independent candidates "Hope for Nová Ves" won the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region, defeating the ANO movement.
The association of independent candidates received 59.88 percent of the votes and thus gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened its position against regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and now has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think, would there be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
"I think that you already know all of this that people are writing to you here."
You're just pretending to be foolish so you have someone to argue with.
If not, then it is sad.
I do not claim that Christians are degenerates or anything of the sort.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was ultimately the goal, to look good).
And I really don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I mind how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you want, but the state and church have nothing to do together.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, during which he was assisted by rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Services.
Workers at the regional operations center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height one hour after midnight on Saturday.
Two ambulance crews - medical and paramedic - immediately left for the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, the medical personnel discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of approximately twelve meters and landed on his head on concrete!
In Vítkovice, they caught coal.
But not as it should be, and firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of losing his life.
The responding doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after further measures within pre-hospital urgent care, the ambulance transported him to the care of the Ostrava Traumatology Center, said Lukáš Humpl, spokesperson for the Emergency Medical Services of the Moravian-Silesian Region.
I have greater concerns about inadequate reactions from the public and authorities than about the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the front line of the fight against the infection are primarily doctors and healthcare personnel.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt.
MMA experienced a spectacular gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not been beaten for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, he demonstrated a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his title.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory by quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody expected.
He brought a women's bantamweight fight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as a figurative "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was eager for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was also in line with the paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey towards victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully attempted to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated themselves to a lot of excellent hits and hard hooks.
Peňová knocked Nunesová to the ground and began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and tap out.
The American woman caused a huge shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala dinner was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active and attempted to defeat his opponent with an armbar.
Although he didn't succeed too well at first, he then created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and bombarded him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley recorded a dominant triumph, as he landed a hard right rear on Raulian Paiva already in the first round.
Subsequently, he beat him with a series of accurately aimed strikes and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France was able to handle Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, but now after seven years, she lost.
That hip, or this hip?
At first glance, it's not anything complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.
There is also a relatively large group of nouns where the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
During declension, they acquire two different endings and in some cases remain in an uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender, in the former they are declined according to the pattern of "stroj", in the latter according to the pattern of "píseň".
In the next group of nouns, there are different forms even in the nominative singular, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are formal, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly with other Czech-Moravian pairs of words such as "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally indeclinable, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is of both masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which remains indeclinable in the neuter gender, but has endings in the masculine gender according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like directly on the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to move further into Europe.
Thousands of people started heading towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
"For three months, we didn't see blue sky and we were suffocating," describes a journalist from Sydney.
Destructive fires, which Australia has been struggling with for four months, have killed almost thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent the drastic impacts as critics claim?
What will the Earth have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone always writes about everything everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to cover it up.
I personally do not know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how their surroundings or even the police often treat these people.
Victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
However, still too many people keep it to themselves.
Even those who falsely accuse someone will eventually meet their match.
It is disgusting and a spit in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are made up" and that it is a "trend", you are only helping sexual predators.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to finish them.
The prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have gotten into a difficult situation because of it.
She doesn't have the means to finish the partially built family houses and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete already started family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into partially constructed and unapproved houses.
"In the worst case scenario, the partially built houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and rent," says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses within a year and we have achieved it in fifty percent of cases.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult because we have to adhere to certain contractual obligations even if the material has become more expensive.
"So we're doing it without profit," said Zdeněk Slivoň, owner of the construction company.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they were counting on the fact that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost seven.
"I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Out of the materials, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment increased in price the most.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is being slowed down by the pandemic.
At the moment, the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is the only one that is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than last year," clarified Křeček.
We are doing well and we will have an even better time.
"The commentator of Czech Radio - myRadio says that there is a lack of real visions."
Apart from the traditional celebrations, speeches by politicians have also traditionally accompanied the entry into the new year.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and the leader of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the leaders of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What important thing have we learned?
I think my thesis is great because I have chosen my own topic, I am building on my bachelor's thesis, I work on it for the whole year and then write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely calm here, as long as a person is not a total idiot and something stays in their head, the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate them with theory.
For example, I studied for a week for my state exams and when I was struggling, the committee always tried to guide me towards some logical deduction that clicked for me and I got it right.
Regarding those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it many times, it's really beneficial, you learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and are done with it.
In my opinion, it's great when there's an exam at the end of a subject that reflects the knowledge gained through a project, not just a defense.
Everything is okay, but don't overload with emails and phone calls and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You will be the same jerk as them.
You dealing with the embassy doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can calmly put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe give it to her in a way that she could slap Xi Jinping on the butt or something like that.
I agree, even though Instagram throws sticks in the way of artists.
Once you don't post stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will decrease to an absolute minimum.
Moreover, it keeps changing what function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
"It's been really pissing me off lately, so I might have to lower myself to TikTok, where many artists in my industry are successful and they almost swear by it."
In the end, I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Workers' Party in Donbas.
The union - yes, breaking - no, opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind occurred.
On December 8, 1991, in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open indulgence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly and without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
And regardless of the loss of the Russian population in the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed in one sitting what had been built over the previous seventy years in the Białowieża Forest, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the sacrifice of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
Consciously, they carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and separated fourteen republics from the largest world power, which had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see impoverishment of the population, the collapse of economies, science, and the military, the rise of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is a concept in political science called "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily abandoned and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket may not directly correspond to its quality and value.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy that meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which this change in price becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or should I wait until Thursday when the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK/kg, one day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and kept in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - with nothing.
These talks about how when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I was walking in Brno on Hlavas street and in the underpass, some girls were handing out some brochures. I always take similar things to help the temporary workers, they can't just throw them away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God. I was confused, but I suspected it was some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who published it and in the end, Scientology came out of it.
Well, he was a good old-fashioned guy, full of completely unnecessary advice, like how I should behave and not be a jerk.
If there wasn't a shortage of paper, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I have experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you love them, without realizing how messed up the situation is.
Several times she threatened me that she would harm herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
About a year ago, the relationship was great, but then another six months passed and she started acting crazy.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lying to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from going crazy again.
Such a person will suck out your feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
I prefer to keep my distance.
When insurance companies frantically buy clouds of tests and rush to find positives, who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers, and others because their employees were randomly assigned five days of house arrest in the random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped with that nonsense and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing bullying.
I see that our old good rogue is returning to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is returning to the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't need to worry about that, just recruit people."
Honestly, I was interested in the products I offered because I wanted to help people, however, the trainings were more about scaring and convincing people.
When the first earned money came, the person quickly realized that if they want to earn, they have to sell several certain products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so a person felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots.
But what I can say is that it was a valuable experience, and one learns not to jump at every opportunity and to thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to others, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many things like that.
HR is calm, managers mind their own management and don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation is happening in some way, in the form of how it is done here it works quite well (set some goals for the next year, we will see in a year what worked and what didn't) - it is more of self-evaluation than someone evaluating you based on some numbers, and so on.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also a bit of a unique case within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels like we are a sort of startup that is squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works in a way that doesn't bother us much as long as there are results.
The missing Czech in Britain has died.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched unsuccessfully for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
The British police confirmed this afternoon to our embassy in London that they have unfortunately found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose any further information about the case.
"Kulhánek expressed sincere condolences on Twitter."
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus on her way home from work. Before boarding, she was supposed to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues at work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, and Interpol listed her as wanted worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police detained one man in this context several days ago.
What role was he supposed to play in the case and what is he suspected of, but it was not disclosed.
At the end of the year, new councils were elected in four municipalities.
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number established by law or the elected councils have disintegrated.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates ran for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men obtained the mandate.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four mentioned municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, and the oldest was 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a fairly demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place in it, and above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
"We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security," evaluated Eva Krumpová, the first vice-president of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while at the very beginning to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease here, but I managed to do it without major difficulties.
I still have a problem dealing with how a large part of the population at all levels approaches it so idiotically.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He would be removed from the function of the president and the ability to regain it.
The chance that it will actually happen is very small, as others have mentioned here.
Moreover, I am not sure if destroying the file could even be considered as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who have been without sex for a whole year is increasing.
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
The website of the DailyMail newspaper states that it mainly concerns religiously oriented people.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity has increased from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women between 18 and 35 years old who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the past year is higher than ever before.
A survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed that other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals.
One of them can be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks, and video games that make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rapidly increasing," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more frequent among people in marriage, with only 5% of them reporting being without sex in the last year in 2021.
Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decrease in sexual activity is also contributed to by fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs.
Although there is a higher likelihood of sexual activity among married couples, the percentage of married men and women under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided on the issue of premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while approximately 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the individuals who are single in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone speaks about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious beliefs.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among unmarried people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
"Stone stated that the trend among 'less believers' has risen from 10 to 20%."
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex is lower among people who are unemployed or have lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend mainly caught on during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandate for COVID vaccination is about whether society should compel a portion of the population to engage in behavior they do not want to, but which could save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which personally interests me the most about the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it will be our fault if we don't order them to do it and they die.
My argument is that we could definitely be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he refused to get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination who is shouting about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that the majority of unvaccinated retirees probably belong to the second group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times so far.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, weather complicates even the preparation of the Jizerská padesátka cross-country skiing race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
What will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a religious fanatic.
Once in high school, our teacher led us across the whole city to the boathouse so we could go on boats and sail down the river.
On our way there, we were walking down a pretty wide street and who do we see in the middle - a member of the Hare Krishna sect.
"Of course, they fell upon us."
I fortunately escaped, but I started talking with one friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul."
"I told them that I don't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, were laughing the whole way to the boathouse.
We are terribly spoiled.
"There isn't much happening, but the system is already collapsing," says Orozovič.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relations," said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, according to the Chancellor, including within the "Normandy Group" consisting of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor to make sure that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned Lukashenko's regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to cover it up.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was already being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame.
"When the police informed her that she could still lose her driver's license for failure to give way while driving and leaving the scene of the accident, she told the truth, according to TVN24 station."
She admitted that she collided with another nun's vehicle, who asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and after finding out that she had over two per mille of alcohol in her blood, they immediately took away her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies were inspired by American stories about beloved dogs.
But they forgot one important thing: the laws of the film industry.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabec Gump - a dog that taught people how to live, another movie Here We Guard is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the screenplay and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Am Watching from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him are returning to the stage.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a Šumava guesthouse that is struggling, begin inviting dog owners to stay there, as well as Julie's father and his partner, but most importantly, their daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least children and the dog enjoyed it.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, despite being a scientist, succumbs to dark delusions in her desire for a child and, when the right "constellation" arises, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates happen to be - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during a guided tour with a local guide). Retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, causing her to fall into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by her family, so that a miraculous healing process with a dog can take place in the heart of the Šumava wilderness.
Nothing against the cleansing power of nature and the love of animal friends.
Their owners know why they have them.
The spectator is amazed at the chaotic content full of unreliable situations and characters that was necessary for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog handler competition, a charlatan from the Šumava region, police officers arriving to search for "drugs" based on a report, and a discussion about the fertilizing power of bone meal among herbs - all of which the drunken family at the pension naturally indulges in.
When the heroine wakes up from a heavy coma and immediately sits at the family table with her hair curled and makeup on, smoking a cigarette and demanding her father's whiskey and meat as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
Furthermore, the creators will explain to the audience that "it sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build strong situations, a sense for character development and the punchline, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is confused, and the overall impression is messy.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their party afloat, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a weak plot, and dog phrases, let alone more vulgar expressions that the characters use.
Even a long-standing membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club is not an argument - as in the case of the lady producer.
In order to promote nature and the friendship between humans and dogs with good intentions, one must also have knowledge of the craft if they want to tell a believable story.
It did not succeed in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of sentiment for the genre in this good family movie.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurish piece wouldn't have passed.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here it is evident that you don't understand it at all, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
For us, it is good.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
"This is also the right Christmas setting," rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
"In 2018, Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted that depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here."
Israel knows how to use technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater to help itself.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital city of Jordan, Amman, there is an increase in tanker trucks.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," reported Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in the Iranian city of Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river has completely run dry.
The region has just experienced the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister declared that the talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz declared on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is staying in the USA, is trying to persuade Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna have brought "no progress" and that world powers "understand that Iran is playing with them."
This also happened to me about 3 years ago.
I liked the girl a little bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wants from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of a pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I kept the girl in doubt and questioning for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me that I'm a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, there was enough snow and nice weather waiting for them.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating because of it.
Even the obligation to prove oneself with a COVID certificate did not discourage Sjezdaře.
While ski lift operators do not complain about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rental shops report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit both the cross-country ski trails and the downhill slopes over the weekend.
Skiers enjoyed the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really turned out well starting from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the slope," praised Jakub Hanuš, the director of the Ještěd Sports Area.
Hundreds of people set out for the first weekend skiing of the new season in the Jeseníky Mountains.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in Šumperk had open.
The weekend attendance was very decent, an estimated 400 people came on both Saturday and today.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, and the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka, was full of praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are in the period after recovering from COVID-19.
"With exceptions, people are prepared for it and provide the necessary documents," said René Hroneš from the ski center Špindlerův Mlýn to ČTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is an interest in renting skis.
"It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers," said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
A greater demand is expected during the period of ski courses.
Even the executive of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, David Šinták, feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
Before the pandemic, we were almost overborrowed.
"Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent," said Šinták to ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, the rental service in the Novako area in Boží Dar is experiencing a high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and interested parties already have to order them in advance.
"We will start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the area, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here like abroad.
Socialized healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor, certainly does not belong to that.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here are leaving abroad.
The owner of the company won't just leave abroad without a reason.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if they don't have a prospect of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one beautiful day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is whether there will be elections at all.
If it's going to be difficult to live here, then some traditional V4 crazy person can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, only his supporters and people whose wealth cannot fit into an airplane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a bet for beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew of the movie Ostrov, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor meanwhile posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or is it just for the sake of filming?
The London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely unlike her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncova worked in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic also has great concern for her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28th around 7:45 pm and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was allegedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the hospital group Guy's and St Thomas'.
"A group of healthcare facilities stated in a tweet that we have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing."
"The statement continued, 'We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police.'"
Even MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case of Srncová at a press conference on Saturday, is calling on the public to cooperate.
"A missing person for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried sick," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I have a feeling that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find it, because she was away from her homeland, away from her family, and worked here for our healthcare," said Harmanova.
The police previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the news website BBC, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
These are not "huge quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is starting to get fed up with our entry.
I was reading upstairs.
I don't know where you got the idea that Russia wants war.
"War is damn expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy."
Comparison with the situation in 1938 is so different in so many aspects that I don't even know where to begin.
Now I can compare it to the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that's what the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to.
Ono, agreements must be kept...
New timetables will apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers using the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, especially regarding suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
Starting from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice will stop at Zahradní Město station in the capital city.
In suburban train transport, trains S7 will depart, which pass through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be newly expanded into other areas.
Among other places, buses will go all the way to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy, and Turnov.
Buses on the Mladá Boleslav route, including lines connecting to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions, will be incorporated.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
Strengthened will be the morning peak and weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when a new express line number 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410, which run to the Liberec region, have been newly included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubá, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoně, and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on dozens of local lines in the Central Bohemian region, including those to Mochov, Dobříš, and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem, and Kolín areas.
Changes also await passengers in other places.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or expanding the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of bus lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk area have undergone changes, and some bus routes on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket.
Hello, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option for finding food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any physical activity, I don't have the energy to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and low-calorie as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I will buy at most pizza, bread rolls, and for a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy food without the need for cooking would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that's the case.
And it's not about trees that you necessarily have to see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why they forbid us to ski off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been living for nothing else but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd since Friday.
They have been together since summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans in which she explains why she kept her love hidden from them for a long six months.
"I dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, I mean, pardon, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
Supposedly, he was the one who broke up with her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
"That which neither of us were looking forward to, but we knew it would happen eventually," continues the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's you, who doesn't care at all and it jumps on you even from a can, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
It's as if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone knew in detail the list of your past partners and were familiar with your mistakes and faults.
"That's just gossip, you want it, it bothers Dara."
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was traveling for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been serving as the vice president of the Juventus football club for a long time again.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalized.
S manželkou Ivanou have been separated for three years, they are not legally divorced yet but only for three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
"And that's why I love my new man, and just like he stands by me, I stand by him. In good times and bad," Rolins concluded.
Hello, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I just want to confirm that dormitories are great for the beginning. Most of my classmates got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which seems like the best option to me because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it certainly won't hurt to look at the listings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding areas (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří quarter is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that direction is nice, besides it is close to most faculties of VUT (I don't know where exactly you are getting on).
I have never looked for a rental myself, but I am a native of Brno, so I can advise you on Brno itself if you need any more information :)
But to me, this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what some doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't sufficiently finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or let them follow the state's curriculum and pay the state for it.
We cannot let a private actor take control of a piece of education just because they add a few coins to receive a full state contribution and thus be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who expressed themselves in this way about a petition campaign for a boycott of a totalitarian state just two days before.
So, a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who assigned you that job.
Otherwise, during cataloging/digitization, I have experienced that even long-time professionals either estimate it by eye or write something like xxx *** (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would deal with it probably in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you wanted to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing from some book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits with what is physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it rather the Odryská Empire (Kingdom) than OdryNská?
PS: Someone has already figured it out here.
Take a look at that comment with ΦΙΛH.
Politicians have no idea what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
This is a much worse predicament than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because nobody understood a certain text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, and basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, it is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with English it's quite interesting, after the UK's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate towards Cejl.
I have been working there for three years now and everything is completely fine.
I often leave work at 10 pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has barely set foot there in their life can say that it's a ghetto.
Well, most of the Roma population in Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not like I would be afraid to go out on the street there at night.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good accessibility to the center, I would definitely go for it.
There are now many apartments there that are newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and his lover Gelemová is like a stake in a fence!
With whom will you spend Christmas?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
"I saw Dáda's wreath and I'm sure Lucie has one too," said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met with Anička, Felix, and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I will be.
I buy gifts regularly and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucie, probably perfume.
"I am a gentleman," added Felix, who came to the music video premiere at Richman club by himself.
I am here alone, but I don't feel lonely.
"Slováček always finds someone he enjoys talking to," says Slováček, who was glad to have met Luďek Sobotka's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it clear with the gift.
And we are an island so that we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, could you explain it to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
The fact that our army is only capable of defending Ostrava is a failure of previous governments, not the army itself, which has been begging for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
"It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not only be a factory for food, says the journalist."
The Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, there has been a decrease in water in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, and even places where there was previously no shortage of water are experiencing lower rainfall.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
However, the impacts are also strengthened by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in relation to drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
So it will be like this, as soon as I manage to stay on the ice in skates, I barely know how to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also completely crazy.
Whether you are a hockey team called "Bear Russia" or "Llama China", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when the score is tied.
But anyway, listening to Czech commentators who point out what the referees notice or don't notice in both men's and women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports like F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and that Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, with another 74... (the sentence is incomplete and ends abruptly)
There have been 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections were registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor for the British Health Security Agency, on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died from Omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
The leader of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson likely broke the law by organizing a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when a lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
Every minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually", through a computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in it at Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the position of Prime Minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, editor of the commercial television channel ITV for Britain, said: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the position of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting spring elections that could end Viktor Orbán's twelve-year government.
These are elections of pan-European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They probably won't be free, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The latest one so far sounds like everyone can choose where they want to go in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that it won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about how much Fidesz would win by and whether they would also have a constitutional majority, not whether they would win at all.
There is now a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big change for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they not play even harder in an effort to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, in which he tells the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the hints of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the news.
Everything starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and used to get very angry as a child to the point where I would lie on the ground in convulsions and turn blue, and they had to take me to the shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes they would discipline me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know what to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, as when I was little I used to fight quite a bit. Now, to release some tension, I might hit something, and when I was younger, I might have slapped my parents' hand (so I wouldn't get hit too hard), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly my upbringing also has its share in it.
I'm afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and handle it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at a time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, perhaps every parent messes up something, it's probably not possible to not at least slightly mess up your children, so I don't blame them for it.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I would call those who create laws of such quality Kundami.
Otherwise, I was wondering if you are afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product, and you having enough to pay for a mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Will Slovakia move forward with the process of the murder of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial in the case of the four defendants accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She mobilized civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kocner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What significant turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are to blame for this huge thing.
How is it possible that this petition received media attention that was orders of magnitude greater than the counter-petition signed by deans of all medical faculties, which was published one or two days later?
Well, they let themselves be fooled and society paid the price.
People were dying from COVID on Czech television even before half a year ago.
Another government is ending and the law on involving municipalities in the selection of a storage site is nowhere to be found.
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs a fundamental revision.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at the end, and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of communities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the government has interrupted the discussion of a proposal that the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the deep repository, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding the storage site, as promised to mayors since 2011 when the first work on this legislation began, which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The proposed law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticized by municipalities mainly for: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for selecting a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Truly effective can only be when municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Facilities Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal of the subject matter almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and reduces citizens of municipalities to mere statistics in permitting proceedings.
The proposal lacks a system setting for compensations for municipalities throughout the process of searching and selecting a site for a repository, its approval, and operation.
Representatives of municipalities realistically do not have too many options under today's legal norms to defend the interests of their citizens when searching for a location for a storage facility.
Only in some permitting proceedings can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister whose interest is to issue the permit.
Any potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on carrying out exploratory or construction work.
The co-decision of local governments, which the Platform is requesting, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in permitting storage facilities, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for these works according to the contract register is almost 4 million Czech crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform against the deep repository, said: After the industry ministers who only pushed the alignment of local governments towards state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste onto their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand with that.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, as they perceive the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a significant construction similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The platform against deep geological repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) with the aim of promoting a change in the state's approach to handling spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological repositories.
The platform further advocates that the decision on selecting a site for potential storage should be conditional on prior consent from the affected municipalities.
John Goodman (69) forced himself to lose weight out of fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, doctors eventually scared him.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And that took it.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, The Sun newspaper reports.
He showed off his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The person from the sitcom Roseanne who was overweight is a completely different person now!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to crack.
"I shoved everything into my mouth," said the actor in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time, I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore," said Goodman to ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It depends on what kind of boss you have and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's about any text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal and perhaps university-level text, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss more.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls and others have several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is something like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
So what about games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), can they even be called bosses?
And then there are mini bosses.
It is simply impossible to translate the word "boss" into a single word in a flat-rate manner, neither Czech nor any other language solves this issue (only Catalan is interesting, as it translates "boss" as the final opponent).
It is simply significant for a story or game, a computer-controlled opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3rd.
The Czech police also got involved in the search.
He has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since December 7th.
Interpol also helps the British police.
Petra Srncova's colleagues last saw her on November 28th in the Czech Republic.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice because of her.
So the whole world is searching for Peter.
"Czech police closely cooperates with British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The search for Petra has been announced even on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, slim, and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherské Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such disappearance is very unusual for her.
Even the local MP Harriet Harman joined the search for Petra.
She joined in hanging posters with Petra's face.
"We have huge concerns about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect.
However, it is not clear who it is and what they had in common with Petra.
"Agent Tesla is terrorizing Czech Republic before Christmas."
While the data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, the attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a large campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to catch the user's attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
"While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was labeled as Copy of Receipt Repairs for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
The harmful code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is rising again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists in November detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still accounts for almost one-fifth of all detections.
The attacks were ongoing continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3rd, 10th, and 15th.
Formbook most commonly contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name "receipt" still appears.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Significant decline and suppression of activity are recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months.
This is today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
Based on the footage of the procession along the waterfront and my experience with protesters, I estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment, the bridge, and the opposite embankment road.
This means that there are really a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passersby are spontaneously joining the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
"I argue that something new is being born here," writes Radek Mokrý.
The persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding common ground.
Even anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and the like wouldn't be able to fill or pay for such a large parade like this.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of Milion chvilek pro demokracii turned upside down.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what movement could be made out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the Pfizer triple-dose vaccine doesn't become a four or more dose one.
It definitely won't be a left-wing or center movement, bet on it.
The triple-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine because it is evident that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, which humanity rightfully takes pride in.
The end of the deadlock, Bulgaria has a new prime minister advocating change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
Tom has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so two more early elections followed.

The global hit consists of "secretly" taken shots.
Over the weekend, concerns grew in Britain about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by the London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
After receiving information about the employee of the children's hospital, not only the police but also her previous employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling.
"Petra's disappearance is completely unlike her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncova worked in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic also has great concern for her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28th around 7:45 pm and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was allegedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the hospital group Guy's and St Thomas'.
"A group of healthcare facilities stated in a tweet that we have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing."
"The statement continued, 'We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police.'"
An anonymous person reported Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková (also a regional Pirate councilor) for violating copyright with her paintings.
The court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a cover for a month.
It was a matter of life and death.
The magistrate referred the complaint to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which is responsible for the road, and because it allegedly did not respond, the pothole remained.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the Road and Motorway Directorate started to "intensively address the situation".
