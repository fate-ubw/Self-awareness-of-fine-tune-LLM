Is there a way to punish him?
In order to prevent such a thing from happening again.
Or how much longer until the restaurant is ready? Can you help me ask?
At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students took on leading roles and their research results sparked great imagination. - Xinhua News Agency
"Using air to wash hands, judging diseases by exhaling, and accurately searching for the source of haze." Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year at Zhejiang University, a series of imaginative academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, and some of these projects have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensors: Your at-home health check doctor.
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated an intelligent smartphone-based biosensor on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale gently, and this device can preliminarily detect your physical health condition from the gas components you exhale."
Zhang Diming explained that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions in the market generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor utilizes graphene, a new type of material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of body health.
Intelligent surgical lamp: the high-energy eyes of doctors.
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed early enough due to inadequate lighting in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in early cancer screening, if doctors cannot timely identify all tumor tissues, cancer cells will continue to spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated with the Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated with the Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by simply rinsing them with water, at most rubbing some soap and squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air and come out.
It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean now!"
Colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue testing have proven that the effectiveness of hand washing using this method is the same as that of regular hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange to make up for it as soon as possible, thx.

"I'm not waiting anymore, cancel the order."
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, thank you.
A certificate that is deemed very meaningful - a first aid certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates for me besides my driver's license!
To put it simply, first aid measures are emergency rescue measures taken when a sudden event occurs, which means providing rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency assistance is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, or sudden respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's really important for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing, which is a terrifying feeling.
"In China, our official data shows that three million people die from accidental causes each year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest."
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved nationwide.
"In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%."
"This is said by Lu Le, the founder of First Response."
"If a person experiences cardiac arrest, without breathing or heartbeat, pressing the acupoint between the thumb and index finger will have no effect."
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to save a person's life.
I found that very few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when things happen, it's too late. So I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it could save someone's life!
You can register for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students can even get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before turning 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!
I plan to take other certificates that I want to take next, such as a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I have ordered ##NUMBER##.
Only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan?!
Never tried.
How come #NAME# can't write clearly?
Thirteen yuan for one?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed delivering my food, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat?!
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To begin with the conclusion, I personally believe that "The Four Seas" is a completely bad movie in every sense.
But if you ask whether this movie has any highlights, it's not entirely true, at least the music selection is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies, one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is one type, and one that makes you indignant after watching is another type. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han is truly unparalleled.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from the Kafkaesque novels, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there are any hidden metaphors implied by the director, but upon careful consideration, you will realize that it is actually a piece of crap.
To begin with, let me briefly explain some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist's place of residence should be on a small island in the southern region, where he relies on his grandmother for support.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her in a small van to Northeast China to see the snow.
An elderly person of advanced age travels by minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow.
He and his father are still very confident about this.
And then the old man didn't say anything more.
How did the brother of the female protagonist obtain the business license to operate a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's gangsters on motorcycles easily block off a section of mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road and even the truck driver couldn't be found around.
"Isn't this prop too obvious?"
Why would a small-time thug with a bad credit history and suspected criminal activity become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't you report the loan shark? In the movie, the police even asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key to open a hotel door, and ends up forcefully trying to find the hotel owner and sleeping outside the room for a night.
This inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and the plot is so absurd that it pains me to recall them.
Apart from the plot, the worst thing about the movie is its theme, or rather, the fact that it doesn't have a theme at all - it's just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you might think that he wants to make a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational film. When you're halfway through, you feel like it could be a drama that reflects the difficulties of young people in small towns. After watching it, you have no idea what you just watched, and you're left with deep self-doubt. Why did you go to the cinema to enjoy feces during the New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then it should be inspirational + comedy, and tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success.
If you want to make a romantic film, then tell the story honestly about the love-hate relationship between a young man who likes riding motorcycles in a small town and a waitress.
"If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot cannot include things that contradict the normal world."
We cannot come up with some unrealistic ideas that even Kennedy couldn't bear, like the character who can still sing after his new motorcycle, played by Yin Zheng, was burned.
As for the female lead, although she is not intellectually disabled, she sometimes behaves like a 5-year-old child in certain aspects. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There's one thing that I can't quite understand - why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival season just to cause inconvenience for the audience?

Introduction of Zhengzhou manhole brick module equipment: production and processing equipment for manhole concrete modules.
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, and well wall module machinery in China, with production lines ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated.
After years of practice and development, we now have high-quality equipment and supporting devices for producing hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated inspection well series.
Assembly site of Zhengzhou manhole brick module equipment for concrete module production and processing equipment inspection.
Features and advantages of Zhengzhou manhole brick module equipment for the production and processing of concrete manhole modules.
Yixin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely applicable to the new masonry materials of municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Various inspection wells, rainwater inlets, square gutters, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have concave and convex grooves on all four sides, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the well wall structure is much better than that of the flat friction masonry construction.
The module is a hollow structure, with longitudinal holes connected after combination masonry, and transverse holes intersecting each other. After the core is poured, it forms a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure, which plays a role in secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are equipped with both horizontal and vertical reinforcement slots, which increase the overall structural strength by providing horizontal bed joints and vertical reinforcement.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are less prone to collapse, sinking, leakage and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control and data input/output devices, one-key touch screen LCD display monitoring of the entire mechanical operation process, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the wellbore wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of the main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system operation.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment material box travels up, the mold box is demolded, the material box door is closed, and the automatic conveying pallet is all independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer and electrical appliances, sealing and hydraulic components, and is equipped with reliable and stable comprehensive performance.
The mechanical vibration platform for wellbore wall module adopts integral plate steel, with no welding points in the cutting and molding of the table top line, allowing the filling box to swing freely and reducing mechanical wear to the fullest extent.
Reduce the load on the mold, combine the filling and compacting amplitudes, adopt integrated and fully synchronized vibration of the table and mold to ensure the solid vibration effect.
The well wall module mechanical vibration machine is controlled by computer to adjust the amplitude according to the cost-effectiveness of raw materials, without wear and tear braking, thus extending the service life and reducing costs.
The wellbore wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeship system, enrollment means becoming a qualified employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, it was learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship system" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive pilot training will also have apprentice status, and after enrollment, they will be pre-registered as employees of pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires standardized enrollment and employment procedures for vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and prospective employees of the enterprise. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but under 18 years old, a four-party agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job training of the apprentice.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship models and collaborate with partner enterprises to provide pre-employment and job transition training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent cultivation mode.
The university and enterprise jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program aims to cultivate students for one pilot cycle, during which the internship time in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the on-the-job internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotation position proficiently.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 municipal-level vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot project, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
Following the principle of piloting before promoting, gradually advancing from point to area, we will explore and establish a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively improving students' job skills, increasing their employment rate and quality.

I have been considering this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally decided to buy it. The suction effect is good, and there is noticeably less dust in the house. However, it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand, and the wet mopping function needs improvement as there are dust marks when going back and forth. Overall, I am still very satisfied.
The food processor is quite heavy and looks high-end, suitable for someone like me who is a novice in the kitchen. My child said the food tastes better than when I cook it myself. I have made two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes, and the sweet and sour pork ribs were especially delicious. It takes a bit longer to cook, but other dishes are quick to make. The noise is very low, so there is no need to worry about burning the food or not knowing how to cook!
Received the goods and couldn't wait to cook three dishes at noon. It's really amazing how technology has changed our lives. The control of heat and seasoning is precise, and the taste of the dishes has been upgraded to a chef-level. It's great for those who are not good at cooking. Highly recommend purchasing!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
An intelligent cooking machine that automatically controls the heat and stirs the food.
No longer need to fear being scalded by hot oil, no longer need to fear not being able to control the heat and burning or undercooking the food.
The dishes stir-fried by him/her are much more delicious than the ones I made. The tomato and egg stir-fry is particularly flavorful, and the eggs have a great texture.
This pot was a great value purchase.
The item is good, worth buying, and very good.
Overall, it is very good, clear, and consistent with the description.
Worth having.
The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and easy on the eyes, and no other abnormalities have been found at the moment.

South African doctor: Although Omicron is highly transmissible, it mostly causes mild symptoms.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to the Associated Press, a group of over 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province have reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are experiencing mild symptoms such as body aches and coughs, similar to those of the flu, as the Omicron variant spreads in the country.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but so far, no patients have needed to be hospitalized.
Pilley said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more susceptible to severe illness from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few more weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in recent weeks have severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of the previous wave. The average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. In recent cases, only 3% of COVID-19 patients have died, compared to a death rate of 20% in the early cases of the outbreak in South Africa.
"The director of the Africa Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: 'Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a relatively mild disease.'"
He also said, "It's still early, we need to obtain data from later stages."
"Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the predominant strain of the coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the new cases discovered in the first week of December in Hauden Province have increased by 400%, and tests show that over 90% of the cases are of the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education commentary: What is needed to rescue abducted children?
If we use the famous public service advertising slogan "No trade, no killing" as an analogy, then in a good environment without the demand for child abduction, community prevention and control, and public anti-abduction efforts can make abduction and trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Abduction Investigation Office of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has launched an emergency release platform for missing children.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to promptly recover abducted children.
Upon hearing that this app is called "Reunion," I feel a warm and cozy feeling.
The new technological methods are not only named "artistic" and full of emotions, but also applied with proper information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, there is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be illustrated by many "big words".
Prioritize the personal safety of the victims before the trafficking case is solved.
Different matters have different priorities. Under the urgent goal of "rescue", controversial topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punished by death penalty" can be temporarily put aside for cautious discussion, but the matter of rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.
Based on the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers tend to leave the crime scene as soon as possible after succeeding.
If the search and rescue operation is delayed by just one minute, the child may be further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase.
In this situation, taking practical actions such as using platforms like "Reunion" that directly help solve cases and recover missing children is indeed a pragmatic approach.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to work together.
From the improvement of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the meticulous enforcement, the protection of children and the rights of parents require the implementation of the care of "protecting the weak and supporting the young" in combating crime.
In addition, more can be done to prevent child trafficking from the family to the society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at a train station, the parents fall asleep, and only wake up to find their child missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, we should at least have a certain level of awareness of protection.
Parents taking turns to rest or placing their children under secure protection are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of cracking down on trafficking crimes by the police, the buyers of trafficked children should also be monitored and punished.
Individual illegal behavior is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the statutory penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is a minimum of 5 years imprisonment; in cases of particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property may be confiscated.
With a high starting point for punishment and the heaviest possible penalty, the crime of child trafficking is clearly one that carries a severe punishment, even in the trend towards lighter sentencing.
Even today, there are still many cases of trafficking occurring every year.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and a weak sense of legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be synchronized.
To effectively control human trafficking, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for child abduction is widespread, the abductors, driven by greed, will constantly innovate their methods, leading to a "battle" with law enforcement. Anti-abduction efforts will inevitably become mired in inefficiency.
Therefore, eliminating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help eradicate crimes of child trafficking and buying.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the delivery driver's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Cannot trace.
I hope you can understand.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than displayed.
No, thank you.
Yes, we have changed the rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
"That restaurant has been saying it's in the process of handling it."
Waited for several hours.
The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two main categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, with five different grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained by mechanical cold pressing and filtering of fresh olive fruits, after removing impurities.
It can be divided into three levels according to different acidity.
Extra virgin olive oil: It is the highest quality and most premium grade of olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary virgin olive oil: acceptable taste and flavor, with an acidity level of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of over 3.3%, also known as "second oil".
Extra-virgin olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Extra-virgin olive oil is blended with refined olive oil in a certain proportion to adjust the taste and color, resulting in ordinary olive oil. Its acidity is below 1.5% and it appears as a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is olive oil obtained by dissolving and refining olive pomace oil.
If you have looked at the grading classification, you should have already noticed that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil.
You should know that olives are like grapes used for making wine. Olives from different regions and different varieties will produce olive oil with different standards.
The optimal growing location for olive trees.
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation, for the growth of olive trees.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, sporadic planting can only be done in suitable habitats in other regions.
Main production area (Mediterranean region):
Countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and others, with similar climates, also include countries as far south as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Harvest month of olive oil:
From March to June every year is the time when olive trees bloom and bear fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season for fruits (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The democratic summit comes to a close, and Biden declares that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy", convened by US President Biden and attended by government officials, civil society leaders, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the heart of every person in the world, and no authoritarian regime can ever extinguish it.
He also announced plans to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political commissioner Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit demonstrates, democracy is everywhere in the world.
"A totalitarian regime can never extinguish the small flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from the entire society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and better resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and fighting back against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day happens to be "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech that the global democracy movement is facing challenges, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech via pre-recorded video at the summit, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been witnessing China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why politicians and leaders of civil society must cooperate.
"We must utilize all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Lo Kin-hei also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you have not realized the threat (of the CCP) to our democratic values."
"And that is the reason for our failure."
"This is also the reason why we must change."
During a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Tang Feng, Executive Yuan Minister without Portfolio, released a video statement titled "National Declaration," emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in combating the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "As Taiwan's democracy continues to flourish, we remain steadfast in standing at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments in various regions have rationalized the violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, and there are signs of global democracy regressing.
"However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without locking down the city, and we can defeat false information without taking it down."
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and several other countries that were identified as serious human rights violators, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time keeps getting delayed.
The original requirement was #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I won't call.
"I'm not eating anymore."
"I will definitely file a complaint."
"Why didn't you say so earlier if you couldn't deliver it?"
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I did not receive a call.
Please notify him to deliver it to our company again.
I don't want to wait for #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
The meal waited for an hour and a half.
"#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered."
"I want to cancel the order."
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similar-priced option to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then expensive ones are usually more friendly than cheap ones. These so-called "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low, and when the ball hits the racket, there is a lot of vibration. The hard ball is difficult to control, even for skilled players.
The logic and implication behind their existence is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won't be able to learn it and you won't want to spend a lot of money on it, so they offer a cheap option to deceive you. You'll play with it a couple of times and then never again, so this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can truly distinguish between good and bad, it means you have improved. Come back to me then and buy the expensive ones, I'll make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand, better quality racket, choosing brands such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough to sell expensive rackets, so a new racket for 500-600 yuan is good enough, while a second-hand one for 200 yuan can provide the same enjoyment as a thousand-yuan racket, isn't it?
It is beginner-friendly, but becomes mediocre once you pass the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, cannot get past the beginner stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Can you help me follow up on this, please?
Postpone.
Thank you.
"So, you mean to say that I already have credit?"
Do I need to place a new order now? Should I ignore the previous one?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing from the delivery and the saliva chicken was also undercooked.

The order I placed is for delivery only, there is absolutely no option for self-pickup.

I don't want food that was prepared an hour ago.
I have found the buyer of the incorrect order from before.
"But my wheel cake is missing."

In fact, there are many considerations for dressing and matching for girls with a slightly plump body.
Girls with a plump body should wear skirts that are not too short or too long, with a length around the knee that can just cover the area where the thighs are fat.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the obesity on the legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you divide your outfit into three sections - upper, skirt, and long stockings - with different colors, it will make you appear naturally taller and create a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a must-have for slightly overweight girls (the author deeply understands this). Dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body's plumpness, and a noble and elegant black skirt is also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black skirt, can make you appear slimmer.
If your calves are thick, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
To avoid giving the impression of being overweight when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
It is important to share tips on dressing and matching clothes for slightly chubby girls.
"Girls who are slightly overweight should avoid wearing tight short skirts, and their tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it can make people feel uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black knee-high stockings or fishnet stockings (the small grid ones). Choose a soft printed flared skirt and pair it with a loose-necked top, which can effectively conceal the shortcomings of overweight girls."
Of course, there is also an art to wearing short skirts for slightly plump girls.
A chubby girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make her plump figure appear taller.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs appear longer and slimmer, which is the most fashionable combination in summer!
If you are a girl with a chubby upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous one-piece short dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, but it can also showcase your strengths.
An A-line mini skirt can make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for chubby girls. Choose a tighter top to create a sense of layering and make you look even slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even plus-size women can give it a try.
"Curvy girls can also dress stylishly."
As long as they can master the rules of dressing and matching, slightly overweight girls can also be the focus of attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, it is also important to exercise more in daily life, striving to get rid of the label of "slightly chubby girl" as soon as possible. 😄

"The thought of it being just a flesh wound makes it okay." - Xinhua News Agency
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, on which was written "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' for her sister's fundraising" went viral on social media.
According to the photo, a girl is standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board reads "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow," indicating that passersby can pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot at the target.
This behavior has sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xicheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move only for her sister's fundraising, but this behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was cautioned for soliciting donations on the street as a "human target" for archery.
In the viral photo, a long-haired girl stands in a "person" shape in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow" written in black ink on the board. Another wooden board in front of her displays her bank account, WeChat, and Alipay account information.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging behavior to attract attention", while many others sympathize with it.
"We discovered the situation around 10am on the 23rd while patrolling near the square, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
Police officers from the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident told local media during an interview that there were two girls selling goods on the street, both around 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
One of the girls who acted as a "human target" was crying and begged passersby to play the game, while the other girl helped by shouting and saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, asking everyone to help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xicheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Beijing News that the girl's name is Jijiali and she is raising funds for her sister Jijia Yan.
However, as the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan, they couldn't think of a good way to raise funds for a while, so they resorted to this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one girl acted as the target while the other assisted, but neither of them actually participated. No one was found shooting arrows during the entire process, only some people were watching and taking photos which were posted on Weibo.
After the police consulted with the public security department, it was determined that the bow and arrow used did not fall under the category of controlled items.
The person in charge stated, "We do not advocate using this kind of sensational fundraising method."
After being warned by the police station, she has already left the police station.
Cooling performance: good, Thinness: convenient, Appearance material: satisfactory. Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
"Stable performance, no problem with four air outlets for heat dissipation, worth recommending."
This Acer Predator Helios Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with solid workmanship and materials, and a trustworthy brand!
The price of Acer Predator Helios Dragon is not considered expensive.
Personally, I think the Acer Predator Helios 300 is really good. The gaming performance is smooth and can handle most games. My PUBG runs at high settings with stable frame rates, very smooth. League of Legends is a breeze, and CS:GO is also easy to handle. Most AAA games can be played.
Cooling performance: The cooling performance is good, the fan is powerful, and it works quietly. Even with all game settings turned on, the fan is still not too loud.
Appearance material: The appearance is quite cool and stylish, and gaming laptops are inherently cool. Display effect: The screen is very clear, and 1080 is enough for playing games.
Buying the notebook, I feel it's really good, especially for design work. It has a high cost performance, lighter than I imagined, and looks better than I expected. The red color on the back is a very beautiful wine color, not too flashy. Overall, it exceeds my expectations and is worth buying. It's also suitable for girls.
I started using the Acer Dark Knight two years ago and after using it for two years, I find it to be a high cost-effective and high-quality product.
I also recommend this product to my friends around me!
"We have already purchased three machines from this series!"
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also very good.
I bought it for my nephew, intending to wait for the 418 bank promotion, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank promotion, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost performance is quite high and the logistics is also fast. Let's come back to give a follow-up review after using it for a while.
A brand new, high-performance gaming laptop with excellent value for money, featuring a great design and pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought for children to use for 3D rendering, software has been installed, child says it can be used without any problems, this computer has good performance for 3D design work.
Bought for my son, he said it's very good.
The computer is great, especially with excellent customer service. If you have any questions, just ask. I highly recommend purchasing it.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What is the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete in Olympic Events for Gold Medals" went viral, which mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: doing grunt work, traveling, and working late are all part of a project manager's daily routine, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are all par for the course.
A seemingly humorous and satirical article actually reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing their powerlessness in current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management work are also gradually choosing to take action to free themselves from the difficulties in their work.
From the increasing number of annual registrations for PMP (Project Management Professional) certification, it can be seen that more and more project management professionals are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "20-year Development Report of Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® exam takers in China has reached nearly 600,000, with approximately 420,000 certified PMP® professionals and around 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certified professionals worldwide.
The number of PMP certified individuals has been increasing year by year in the past decade, indicating that more and more project managers realize that relying on simply copying past "old experiences" is no longer feasible. The rapidly changing work environment teaches us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the path forward.
However, does passing the PMP exam guarantee smooth project management work?
Many novice project managers have expressed that although they have learned about the ten knowledge areas and five process groups of project management through courses such as PMP/IPMP, they still feel confused when it comes to actually managing projects.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to put them into practice; lack of systematic project management process and institutional support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and project delays; unclear division of labor among team members, and "old hands" in the team do not know how to deal with it; cross-departmental communication is not smooth, making it difficult to advance the project...
Therefore, with over a decade of focus on product innovation and R&D management, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped numerous outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has been awarded honors such as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". They now bring the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
"R&D Project Manager Training Camp" online course is a fragmented learning approach that combines practical cases, tools, and methods from numerous R&D-oriented enterprises to help you master essential knowledge and standard actions of project management and advance your own project management skills.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the development of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and to bring about efficient operational results for the enterprise.
"Talk is cheap, you can first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and numerous well-known enterprise real business scenarios to provide in-depth and easy-to-understand professional explanations of the course content."

Czech Republic's Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival nationwide online payment transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
The diverse range of discounts and promotions, as well as the eye-catching live streaming sales, have once again made consumers shout out for benefits. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people marvel at the increasingly strong national purchasing power, but on the other hand, it also requires us to calm down and reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", Cetelem Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Cetelem") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and refuse blind and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, which is 2.04 higher than in 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy levels of the elderly and young people are relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education. Nielsen's "Report on the Debt Status of Chinese Young People" and CCTV's "2019-2020 Report on Youth Consumption in China" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, which is quite different from the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have resulted in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even gradually increased social problems. Financial enterprises should take social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Citi has always been committed to providing high-quality and thoughtful services to help people build their happy lives, advocating for consumers to establish good and correct consumption concepts, and actively responding to regulatory calls to improve consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially among young people, through practical actions.
Over the past few years, Cetelem has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities targeting young people, including college students, and subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and thus accumulate life wealth for them.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct money concept, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption and borrowing misunderstandings, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead, act within one's means, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as buying a car or a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Cetelem will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with more tailored and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, assist consumers in cultivating the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a lifelong trusted consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Army Newspaper - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's itinerary includes stops in Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal solidarity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the region's countries.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to Qatar from both countries.
The resolution of the Gulf Arab countries' differences to restore relations with Qatar is driven by the necessity for unity in the interest of each country and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' companies have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion in total.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and major world powers to save the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Gulf Arab countries have condemned for failing to address Iran's missile program.
Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a "rival" and consider Iran's nuclear program a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf countries believe that it is flawed to not address the issue of Iran's missiles and not take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of failed nuclear negotiations between major countries and Iran to meet the wishes of Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran have engaged in direct talks.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the resolution of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of unity within the GCC, while proposing measures to ensure full cooperation among its member states in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Claimed to have the loudest exhaust sound in the New Mountain District for supercars!
The car our team is presenting to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is the successor to Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, with an annual road tax of tens of thousands of Malaysian Ringgit, and it has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
Well, I don't know for sure, but according to the data, the 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. That means while my Myvi is still at 30km/h, the other car would have already reached 100km/h.
The low-slung body, bold scissor doors, massive air intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible beneath the glass all perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
There's no need to say too much about the description of the car model, just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be provided by Google.
Being too much in the spotlight, everyone is watching wherever I go, it's very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool)
The cost of fuel for 1km is around RM1 (car owners don't even care).
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you might climb into the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will instantly become deaf when you get off the car. (But it's still very cool.)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in a regular parking space. I am afraid of being hit by the door of the car next to me when it opens.
A bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (said by the editor, unrelated to the car owner, haha).
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their cars, please feel free to contact us!
"More car information that you don't know, only in The Car Guide / People's Car Journal."
Involving a car accident worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known among car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range!
On that day, foreign countries crashed million-dollar sports cars like the 911 and the Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it's reasonable to be expensive!
Let the spirit of universities resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency.
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that a university has accumulated and formed during its development process, and it is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities has been crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they emerged in the midst of national crisis and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the values of "enlightening morality and benefiting society, cultivating oneself and governing the country" and the patriotic responsibility of "strengthening the country through education".
Currently, the trends of informationization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly apparent, and global competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important aspect of the "supply side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially with the proposal of the overall plan for promoting the construction of world-class universities and disciplines, it not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination in advancing from a higher education power to a higher education powerhouse, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to become a world-class player in a shorter period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having confidence in their goals, path, and abilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages: first, the advantage of being a latecomer, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the advantage of culture, inheriting the wisdom and connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, in order to consolidate strength, shape brand, and enhance image; third, the advantage of system, leveraging the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for universities to accelerate their catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be uniform across all schools. While each school must leverage its strengths, it must also demonstrate its individuality and uniqueness.
The characteristics of education should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, educational traditions, and resource endowments.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in our education: firstly, emphasizing the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, constructing an integrated education environment that combines science and education, and school-enterprise cooperation, forming a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlighting the convergence of disciplines, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating a system environment for interdisciplinary studies, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; thirdly, highlighting the characteristics of the education system and social services, conducting in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit consists of the motto "Seeking Truth, Pursuing Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Integrity, Discernment, and Pragmatism", and the shared goals of "Embracing Diversity, Cultivating Virtue, Advancing Knowledge, and Serving Society".
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It is rich in connotation and has profound significance.
"Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the attitude of "using talents from all over the world", and reflects the high-quality educational concepts of world-renowned universities. "Qizhen Houda" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and pursuing goodness, which means that universities should not only pursue truth but also receive moral education and personality cultivation. "Kaifu Qianmin" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge and scientific research innovation, as well as reform and development. "Shuwo Bangguo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, stating that universities should always share the same fate with the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to silence, the enlightened perceive the unseen."
Chinese universities should further establish themselves in the overall context of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission and era orientation of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the nation resonate with each other, providing inexhaustible power for achieving national prosperity and rejuvenation, and realizing the common ideals of humanity.

Iranian President: If sanctions against Iran are lifted, there is hope for a nuclear agreement - Xinhua News.
Iranian President Rouhani said in Tehran on December 11th that if the United States lifts sanctions on Iran, a good agreement can be reached in the negotiations on the comprehensive nuclear agreement.

As NFTs are rapidly gaining popularity, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn stable income through this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a blockchain-based pet breeding game that incorporates various gameplay elements including NFTs. It is currently the highest-grossing NFT project with a transaction volume exceeding $3 billion.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, approaching that of "King of Glory".
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" is spreading a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts. Players are no longer just a single role, and in addition to enjoying the game and earning economic benefits, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but ensured by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from the news about my friend's stock price is the importance of a company's choice of industry, or investment target. Firstly, it is crucial to choose an industry with a large growth potential, with a market size of at least 100 billion. Secondly, it is important to select an industry with good future growth prospects, considering industries that will reach their optimal growth state in the next 3-5 years. Lastly, it is essential to choose an industry with government support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
"Fuel up for the right track!"
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right", which means doing things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which means doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics are about implementation, and there is room for strategic thinking above most tactical considerations.
For example, beyond tactical thinking such as how to increase customer numbers, strategic thinking can consider whether to deepen current areas or expand horizontally; beyond tactical thinking such as improving customer retention rates, strategic thinking can consider how to improve the retention rates of core and high-value customers; in improving activity participation rates, setting the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; in improving DAU, considering whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin, which has been in existence for 12 years, has witnessed several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as a legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has become a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' proposal to launch a Bitcoin ETF, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and expanding the exposure to cryptocurrency investments in the US capital market.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

(Xinhua) Over 130 Asian-American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process at three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
"The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of prestigious American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American universities has remained at the same level."
Many studies have shown that these universities engage in "long-standing and systematic discrimination against Asian American applicants" in their so-called "holistic" admissions processes.
Zhao Yukong introduced that in 2014, research by scholars such as Sanders showed that among all ethnic groups, Asians had the lowest admission rate relative to the number of applicants at these three universities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian American applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can conduct investigations and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the complained universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, and at that time, it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American group, the education groups participating in the appeal also include Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American groups in the United States.
We need utensils.
Just canceled the order.
Why is it still in progress?
Can you help me check if it has been cancelled?
But I already placed the order at 5:09 in the morning.
That's the ordering hotline over there, they don't know anything.
Is there a phone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the relative of the property owner, regarding the details of purchasing the factory building, and transferred a deposit of 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt for Deposit of Factory Sale", which states, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will belong to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice. Both parties agree to sign the factory sale contract within one week."
However, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, which resulted in a delay in signing the house purchase contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit and prepared the payment, but just before signing the contract, the seller backed out, leaving Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure to sign a formal contract could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed as a failure of negotiation. Therefore, the penalty for breach of contract by forfeiting the deposit should not apply in this case, and the defendant should not be held liable for double refund of the deposit.
After the first trial verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind you to exercise necessary due diligence obligations during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on Saturday (December 11th) stating that the United States' hosting of the "Leaders' Summit for Democracy" is "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and toolifying democracy, engaging in anti-democratic practices under the guise of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic reform', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was conducted via video, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, stating that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also doubts and criticisms both internationally and domestically in the United States, for example, criticizing the invitation of some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration in organizing this summit is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the virtual democracy summit.
The statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday stated that "Today's American-style democracy is fully revealed, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth disparity becoming increasingly severe," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital foundation.
In his speech, US President Biden stated, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better resist the forces of authoritarianism, and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must constantly renew it in every generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "as global democracy and human rights face ongoing and deeply concerning challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year initiative, including a $424.4 million proposal, to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media, following the democratic summit.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our nations live up to our commitments and report our progress next year."
"Okay, I'm just afraid he might have sent it to the wrong address."
Ri Chang Restaurant (Wudaokou branch)
[Peppermint] Environment: Average [Service Bell] Service: Dishes are served quickly. "Traditional Ma La Gao" is a must-try dish for me. Ma La Gao is too fragrant, soft and delicious 😋. If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish and Tofu Hotpot". The soup is very delicious, the tofu is very tender, and the cuttlefish...
Great taste, good meat, and enthusiastic service.
It's been a long time since I last came to Richang, the fruit mix is still so delicious and made with quality ingredients. The first time I ordered the char siu bao, it had the soft and fluffy texture that I love from Southern-style buns!
The claypot rice is perfectly cooked with the right amount of moisture, and the portion is very generous. The signature tin foil chicken wings are as delicious as always, and the soup is also good. The Chinese broccoli is also well-prepared...
Great taste, enthusiastic service, and good meat.
"Ri Chang Old Shop was also a popular internet sensation many years ago, located in a small building in Dongdan with wooden floors."
The clay pots used for the popular rice dish always crack due to the long wait outside the door.
I haven't been to Richang for several years. The rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a seat as soon as you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is beyond words, as always excellent.
Taste is great, meat is good, and the staple food is also praised.
"Ri Chang takeout."
The rice meal: This time the dishes were a little disappointing.
Three-cup chicken: a bit too many side dishes, and the chicken is slightly lacking in quantity.
The main flavor is a bit off, the saltiness of the base is not enough, which highlights the sweetness, so you can imagine a sweet taste with various spices and side dishes.
What is the proper way to drink red label whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some like collecting, some like food, and of course, some like wine. Red Label Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has won a gold medal at an international liquor competition.
Each bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're wasting its richness.
How should we drink the red label whiskey then?
Let me briefly introduce it to you.
Red label whiskey drinking method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label blended Scotch whisky is made from around 35 different Scottish whiskies, and has a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky, with a strong aroma of sweetness and smokiness.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be consumed directly with ice or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Label whiskey has entered the domestic market, and to cater to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey mixed with cola, Sprite, or other carbonated beverages has become a long-lasting fashion trend.
These sweet drinks not only help to neutralize acidity, but also provide visual pleasure and can be added to beverages to dilute the taste of alcohol and change the mouthfeel.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink red label whiskey is with a slice of lemon and a cube of sugar (or granulated sugar).
Authentic Hongfangwei has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, and lemon can bring a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three methods are the best ways to drink red label whiskey, and you can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Educational Reflection: How can university exams cater to both "top students" and "struggling students"? - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of exams, change the exam format, and truly reflect the actual level of students in exams.
Indeed, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world with varying levels of abilities, and coupled with differences in their learning progress, the learning situations are vastly different.
It is inevitable to have different perceptions when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions have a single type, high repetition rate, and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Lazy students may pass the exam by cramming before it, but if they try other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a strange phenomenon where "underachievers" can pass or even get high scores without putting in much effort, while "overachievers" who never miss class and excel in homework and note-taking only perform marginally better on exams.
It seems that the issues raised by students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University regarding university exams are not unfounded, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should give a thumbs up to these three students who wrote the letter candidly.
In fact, those who have attended college are well aware that the phenomenon of cramming for exams, trying various ways to obtain exam questions from teachers, striving to define the scope of the exam, and seeking "key coaching" before the exam is not uncommon, and even the situation of cheating during the exam and asking teachers for leniency after the exam is not unheard of.
In my opinion, as a guidance for evaluating teaching quality, measuring the pass or fail of a university exam depends more on the teacher's comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to specialize, and many courses focus on fundamental knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the fundamental knowledge points of a subject is what university exams aim to test.
As for undergraduate knowledge, it is mainly composed of subject basic theories and common sense. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher put it, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned in university 20 years ago is still being studied today and remains crucial."
However, the consistency of the knowledge points does not mean that the exam questions are uniform or repetitive.
In many universities, exams are usually composed by a group of question setters, and then the test papers are organized by senior teachers in the subject. The grading of exams is also participated by all teachers who are responsible for the subject, which can to some extent overcome the problem of repeated exam questions.
However, in order to formulate a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should follow a normal distribution based on the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and analyze the students' learning level, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and question types of the exam proposition. This can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of abilities, while also innovatively designing the question types.
Examinations are the baton of university education. The type of examination will determine the corresponding study plan for students, and this will ultimately affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the recommendation letters for students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
It is required that each teaching unit organize teachers to conduct discussions and self-checks against the final exams, formulate exam paper propositions and related regulations, and strengthen supervision and inspection of the exam paper proposition and review process, refine the assessment of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Addressing the issues of single question types and repeated questions at the mechanism level is a topic that university exam management needs to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be put in place, but the key lies in daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning situations, not only mastering the teaching content but also understanding the students' learning situations. By fully understanding both ends, teaching and learning can be better connected, forming a virtuous interaction, and exams will be more practical, allowing both "top students" and "struggling students" to achieve their potential.
If it's not possible to change the branch location for me, can it be changed to delivery instead?
So I don't have to give more money again, right?
My colleague's order has already been delivered.
"I can't finish it."
What about GPS? Has it arrived or not?
"Jin Madam Wedding Photography (Nanjie Branch) currently has no other branches."
Before taking the photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't schedule it properly. Consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
The staff of Madame Jin, including advisors, makeup artists, and photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time in my life that I put on makeup formally. Wow, I can hardly believe that I could become so pretty one day. Haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) have great patience in doing makeup, and their makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were shot in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day and we didn't feel very cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist kept an eye on our clothes and accessories, and would immediately help us tidy up if anything was slightly out of place.
The photographer is also very humorous and feels happy after taking photos all day.
When selecting photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want to let the clients delete too many photos. However, when we were selecting photos, we didn't have any intention of adding photos. We just chose the 24 photos in the package, without adding any (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to her package, which shocked me and made me afraid of choosing too many).
Today the photos were fixed, Lanlan sent them to me, and I found two that were not very good. They immediately helped me to fix them again.
Comparing the photos my sister took before, I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Fu Ren for wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan.
Madame Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and success in your future endeavors!

"3200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper."
The Sabah National Registration Department said that since early October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeit paper inventory, affecting a total of 3,200 people to date.
However, the director Kairuaminus assures that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued once the security paper arrives next week.
He explained at a press conference in response to a report by an online media outlet that Sabah Times had been experiencing paper printing issues for up to 10 months.
"He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was also facing the same problem."
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing customized anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used for Sabah's birth certificates is different from that used in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kelu Aminos revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and immediately proceed to the final stage of printing upon returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20th) to deliver to the applicant's hands."
"We will notify applicants to go to local branches to collect their birth certificates."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
"Waiting since around 7 o'clock until now."
"Is it almost here then?"
I'm referring to food.
I am waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again.
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant said it's ready.
People's Daily commentator: "The 14th Five-Year Plan" has achieved a good start - On studying and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th: People's Daily commentator article on December 12th: "A Good Start for the 14th Five-Year Plan" - On Learning and Implementing the Spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference.

We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, officially announce the comprehensive completion of a moderately prosperous society and the achievement of the first centenary goal, and embark on a new journey towards the second centenary goal of building a socialist modernized country.
We held the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, summarizing the significant achievements and historical experience of the Party's century-long struggle, and passing the third historical resolution in the Party's century-long history, "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Century-long Struggle". This is a political declaration for the Communist Party of China to remember its original mission, adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and a guide for action to learn from history, create the future, and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the world has experienced unprecedented changes and the global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact, making the external environment increasingly complex and severe.

The "14th Five-Year Plan" has achieved a good start, with an important aspect reflected in taking new steps to build a new development pattern and achieving new results in high-quality development.
China's economy maintains a leading position globally in both development and epidemic prevention and control, with strong resilience, great potential, and abundant momentum; the country's strategic scientific and technological strength is rapidly growing, with major innovative achievements emerging one after another, and its technological innovation capabilities continue to improve, achieving new breakthroughs in key core technology research and development; the industrial chain has been strengthened, with an increase in the quality and quantity of foreign trade, continued optimization of the structure, and the growth and expansion of new driving forces represented by new industries, new formats, and new models; reform and opening up are advancing in depth, with a focus on removing bottlenecks that constrain supply-demand matching and factor mobility, and creating new advantages for cooperation and competition through high-level opening up; social welfare is effectively guaranteed, with continuous expansion of employment scale, basic synchronization of residents' income growth with economic growth, and a continuous annual grain output of over 1.3 trillion kilograms for seven consecutive years, achieving "eighteen consecutive bumper harvests"; ecological civilization construction continues to advance, with coordinated efforts to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality, steady progress in green and low-carbon transformation, and new achievements in ecological environment protection.
The achievement of these results is the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the concerted efforts and hard work of the whole Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

With General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the entire party, and with his scientific guidance of the socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and with the unity and tenacious struggle of the entire party and people of all ethnic groups, we will surely overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, and create new era brilliance and forge new historical achievements in the new journey of building a socialist modernized country.
Next year, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held, which is a major event in the political life of the Party and the country.
Uphold the great spirit of building the Party, adhere to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, comprehensively deepen reform and opening up, adhere to innovation-driven development, promote high-quality development, adhere to the supply-side structural reform as the main line, coordinate epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, coordinate development and security, continue to do a good job in the "six stabilities" and "six guarantees" work, continuously improve people's livelihood, focus on stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, maintain the economic operation within a reasonable range, maintain social stability, and we will definitely be able to maintain a stable and healthy economic environment, a safe and stable social environment, and a clean and upright political environment, and welcome the 20th National Congress of the Party with outstanding achievements.
Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, enhance the "Four Consciousnesses", strengthen the "Four Confidences", and uphold the "Two Safeguards", continuously improve our political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution, and implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee with practical actions, constantly advancing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

Super convenient, just like opening it on a computer, it solved the problem of my computer's insufficient hard drive space.
The brand new solid state mobile hard drive that arrived today cannot be read by the computer, and the computer does not recognize the mobile solid state hard drive, but it can be read by a computer using a USB drive.
The machine is easy to operate and has a stylish and attractive appearance.
I used it for the whole afternoon today, and the heat dissipation is very good. I basically don't feel any heat. The running speed is very fast, and it can boot faster than 99% of users.
The battery is also very strong, with a standby time of 9 hours and should have no problem with 4 hours of use. Overall, I feel very happy to be able to buy a machine of this quality at this price. Other functions will be added later as they are discovered.
The appearance is very good.
In terms of performance, evaluate after using it for a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than expected, and the rendering effect is great. I like it. I will provide a follow-up review after using it for a while.
Not bad, not bad. The serial number of the machine can be found on the Hong Kong ** website, so the quality should be okay.
The feeling is not about size, but weight. It's not actually that big that one hand can't hold it, just a little bigger than 15.6 inches. It runs very stable and there is no lag. I love the sound of the fan for heat dissipation, it feels great and it won't keep spinning like a gaming laptop.
The product is good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they even gave me a backpack. I think it's great.
The shopkeeper's service was also good, reminding me to update the BIOS and promptly issuing a receipt.
Worth it!
Heat dissipation: The heat dissipation is very good, with almost no heat. Lightweight: Convenient to carry. Appearance and material: Traditional Thinkpad design, satisfying.
A reputable seller carefully inspects the appearance and all interfaces of the entire machine, with no signs of refurbishment or prior use. It is indeed a brand new American version machine with the same configuration as advertised on the webpage.
Forgot to send the backpack, but immediately helped me to send one. Although it was not the standard original backpack, the service follow-up was enough to prove that the seller is a conscientious one.
If any friends need to buy a laptop, buy it again.
Appearance material: the appearance is atmospheric. Display effect: the screen resolution is good, clear. Thinness: it has a good texture, after all, heavier things feel better.
Cooling effect: I will evaluate it later after trying it out.
Typing on the keyboard is pretty good, and it also comes with a mouse and converter. Compared to domestic products, this configuration is still very cost-effective. Overall, it's a good value for the price. As for the machine's performance, I'll evaluate it after using it for a while.
This screen is really comfortable!

On the 21st and 22nd, the examination for special talents in Beijing's junior high school enrollment will be organized and implemented by the education committees of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of enrollment of students with special talents, making the competition for such students more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, this year the proportion of special admissions students from primary schools to junior high schools in the district will not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan, with a planned enrollment of 380 students, and the enrollment ratio will not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Students who have talents in sports, arts, and technology and have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent recruitment examination.
To facilitate students' participation in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement method of last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination sites are divided by examination areas, and the examination periods are divided into hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination sites in different examination areas according to the designated time periods for examination.
On May 23rd, the district education enrollment examination center published online the list of students who passed the examination, and students can check their results online.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
No food received.
The key is that I haven't eaten anything tonight.
If you can't deliver it, you can tell me earlier.

The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control measures in port cities, including a 48-hour negative nucleic acid test requirement and the establishment of "buffer zones".
BEIJING, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who have left port cities on land borders (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold negative nucleic acid test certificates within 48 hours and undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arriving in port cities on land borders.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when the port cities are determined and announced by each province, autonomous region, and municipality to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The person in charge of the Disease Control and Prevention Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and there is frequent exchange of border residents between the two sides.
Implementing differentiated management policies for different regions, transforming from a single line of defense against external outbreaks to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve front-line prevention and control, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local outbreaks of COVID-19 in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice points out that this exposes problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some areas, inadequate closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, inadequate disinfection at various stages of cold chain items, non-standard management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficiently scientific and precise epidemic emergency response.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to accelerate the filling of short boards and weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, and to make no relaxation and scientifically precise efforts to do a good job in prevention and control, and to weave a tight external defense line to prevent input.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize the epidemic prevention and control work with the guarantee of people's livelihood, publish and keep open the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee, regularly investigate the potential risks in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and proactively respond to prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and banners) where open land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, states, and leagues) and municipalities where they are located, and the specific scope will be determined and promptly announced by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

"Youtube video exposes the truth of 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the US military - Xinhua News Agency"
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on YouTube platform titled "Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, and committing various crimes against humanity during the 20-year period of poverty and war, bloodthirstiness, and indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Abusing drones to launch air strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and establishes killing groups.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
One crime after another against humanity has stirred up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video stated, the American "war on terror" is becoming more and more terrifying as it continues.
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, or hope to the Afghan people, only a devastated country and countless acts of killing and destruction.
Click on the video and let's expose the truth behind the United States' bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" and reveal the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
I accidentally came across an article that discusses from a business perspective and a preservation period perspective why this client wants a logistics company inside the bonded zone to help with canning, even though canning is considered deep processing and not within the scope of the logistics company's business. The following text may explain why the client wants to do this.
I have visited many manufacturers of milk powder and have been in contact with many production lines of milk powder.
In fact, the raw materials of powdered milk in bag packaging and can packaging are exactly the same, with no difference.
So you may wonder: why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or perhaps you may ask: why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged products?
Actually, many consumers, especially mothers, believe that the quality is much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that expensive is better.
Some consumers also eat with this mentality and react by saying that the taste or flavor of the canned food is different!
Now let me first explain to you why the bottled version is expensive and what makes it expensive.
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Most manufacturers consider that if the price of bagged products is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low or even non-existent. So, what can the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a significant increase in the pricing of canned goods to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote bottled packaging instead of bagged packaging.
And where do you think the manufacturers get the tens of millions or even billions of advertising fees they spend every year?
Everyone can imagine.
As society develops, the marketing costs such as promotion staff, display expenses, gift expenses, advertising expenses in shopping malls are also increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is constantly adding new products, and they are all in the form of canned goods, with prices continuously rising. In fact, these new products are a result of the increasing market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not increase by more than 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that resort to any means to promote their products, by collaborating with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, with profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per listen.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operating methods, and in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and transfer it into a canister at home, which can save costs and increase the shelf life and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on children.
Also, don't assume that the shelf life of canned goods is longer than that of bagged goods. If the shelf life of canned and bagged goods is the same after opening, it's just that bagged goods are not easy to store and are prone to moisture and spoilage.
The delivery was late, and the food was cold, dry, and hard, making it completely inedible.
And the soup also spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, everything #PRS_ORG# sent will definitely be spoiled.
"I haven't taken it!"

"Don't scare people at the starting line." - Xinhua News Agency
When browsing through book markets, one can often feel the popularity of success-oriented books.
Many of today's self-help books promote the "best principle" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" first, and then telling you what you need to do.
This is equivalent to skipping over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
As a result, these books all share a common trait - either give it your all and do your best, or don't bother doing anything at all; it's either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Tai or just stay put.
The "best principle" is universally acknowledged as "absolutely correct", but 99% of people are intimidated by it at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a painful decision, transform yourself completely with a 180-degree turn," which happens to be a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who cling to tradition, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, shouting "you need to change" in their ears is undoubtedly a self-deception and a futile effort.
The vast majority of people are intimidated by the word "change", hesitant to move forward and find it difficult to make a decision. Alternatively, some may impulsively make the decision to "change" and bravely take the first step, but often this enthusiasm is short-lived and they quickly give up, unable to sustain their efforts.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" vividly expresses this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "sigh at the sight of the door".
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way that may enable more ordinary people to embark on a path to relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories into big victories", that is, if you can't achieve 100, achieving 1 is also acceptable: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dune in front of your house is also acceptable, because it is always better than standing still.
In short, doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as one persists in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
The path to success by following the "second best principle" is just slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" appears to promote success for everyone, it ultimately only motivates a few; whereas the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
No one answered the phone.
Constantly delayed.
"Not delivered yet."
May I ask, when will it be delivered?
How can I get in touch?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He missed two meals to deliver, but one order has been completed.
I would like to ask, how can I contact the rider?
Just now the first rider told me that there should be another rider delivering.
The resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year, according to Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - According to the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to last year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002, it has increased more than 40 times.
The naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as excessive hunting, deteriorating aquatic environment caused by naked carp breeding, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
Meanwhile, by continuously increasing protection efforts through artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passage channels", the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing bans in key water areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, and has established a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one stream, and one lake".

Just read an article about menstruation, it was too long.
Provide a popular science explanation for men who don't know.
Most girls will experience their first period suddenly between the ages of 13-15, and will go through menopause around the age of 50.
Assuming good health, it will come regularly every month.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately, with a tolerance of about a week, so preparation is needed in advance, and sometimes bad luck can cause unexpected changes (such as suddenly coming early by several days).
The duration of time, amount of blood, and degree of pain vary from person to person. Some people may experience it for three days, while others for a week; some may have light bleeding, while others may have heavy bleeding; some may have no reaction, while others may experience such severe pain that they need to be taken away by an ambulance. The severity of menstrual pain can change over time, and just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful forever.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and there will be 24-hour bleeding for several days from the beginning to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to prevent blood from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen quickly at the beginning of the menstrual period before the onset of dysmenorrhea can effectively alleviate the pain of the month. It is not effective to take it after the onset of dysmenorrhea.
Before menstruation, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the menstrual cycle and you suddenly have diarrhea, your period will likely come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours to prevent bacterial growth. In the worst case scenario, one may need to change pads six times a day, excluding sleeping hours. This amounts to 42 pads per month, and with additional preparation, it may be up to 50 pads. It is not necessary to use one pad per month.
(Modification: You don't need to change sanitary tampons frequently. You can change them every five to six hours, and the longest time is eight hours.)
Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation may cause irritability, while the changes in hormones during ovulation can lead to emotional instability, which is unfortunate as the body is tripping itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women still have a high level of emotional control and do not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, it includes shed uterine lining.
The endometrium is thinnest after menstruation and gradually thickens afterwards. It can be understood as the uterus being a house, building a house (thickening of the endometrium) every month to prepare for guests, but if the guests do not come, the house is demolished (menstruation), and a new house is built the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for several decades, bleeding for 24 hours a day for several days every month, and also experiencing abdominal and back pain. Who would want that?
However, humans are able to be born because their mother has had a menstrual cycle. Menstruation is to prepare the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. We should be grateful to our mothers for having a regular and healthy menstrual cycle.
Many things related to women were suppressed in the past, and society brainwashed women into thinking that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting, thinks that the female body's preparatory actions for nurturing life are disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and don't understand it should not be ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude? How can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try using menstrual cups, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, and sending the wrong thing can be quite disappointing.
Please order an additional meal for the children to eat.
I hope that amidst the busy schedule, the store can still check the quality of their products.
Does the foot bath make your feet numb because of an electrical leak?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic and health effect on your feet. Today, the GOME editor will provide answers to this issue, hoping to be helpful to friends.
With the increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from foot baths priced at over 100 yuan to those priced at thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a great deal of choice.
On the surface of relevant data, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well compared to traditional household appliances, but foot baths do not have specific industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently he bought a foot bath tub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet when soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he did not expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and was surprised to find that it lit up. He then discovered that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for the long-popular foot bath tub in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety guarantee.
However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but there may be a few products that have not been strictly checked during production.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-style foot bath.
Hydroelectric separation poses no safety hazards.
You can also use the electric pen to test it freely.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online.
On December 10th, Hunan Daily News (reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) reported that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center this morning, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of reaching a 100 billion yuan tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice Chairman of the Council of All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced with great enthusiasm at the opening ceremony: The source of Hu Hong tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new vitality into the "colorful Hunan tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a billion-yuan tea industry in Hunan, and formed a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Rivers, and Five Colored Teas".
The tea industry within the province is increasing innovation, with main tea types such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to promote their strengths. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, which is driving increased income for tea farmers.
Fortunes change, and now it's time for red tea to shine.
Experts in the tea industry within the province state that by harvesting green tea, followed by red tea and black tea, tea farmers can generate income throughout the year, leading to a significant increase in the output value of tea gardens.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua was delighted to receive the "Origin of Hunan Red".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants placed an order for a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" upon seeing it.

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" comes from the phrase "the metaphysical refers to the Tao, the physical refers to the tools" in the "Commentary on the Appended Statements" of the Book of Changes, and was translated into metaphysic by the Japanese philosopher Tetsuro Watsuji during the Meiji period.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns only represent a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
The theoretical foundation holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
The method of naturalism refers to a research method that does not mention God.
The philosophy of mind is a philosophical branch that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought in discussing the relationship between the mind and body.
Epistemology is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically reflects on and studies human moral life, where morality is defined as all the behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying ethical theories or criticizing their nature) and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and providing moral guidelines for correct or incorrect behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior standards people should follow, applies ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to practical life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and describes ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing it from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not start from theoretical assumptions, but rather investigates the actual moral agents and their observed real choices, all the moral factors that contribute to these choices, and the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: The ethical ideas of humanism, represented by figures such as Voltaire and Montaigne.
Part 2: The ethical ideas of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British Empiricist Ethics, represented by Hume, etc., 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, represented by Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, represented by Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British Utilitarian Ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, etc., 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, represented by Rickert, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional period ethics (irrationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies the principles and standards of valid inference and proof.
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the essence and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To a Friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided during the more than 30 years since our family tragedy, especially for the continuous assistance since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends both domestically and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the deceased victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and found employment.
"Your kind actions have helped us, the families in distress, to get through the most difficult times."
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease providing humanitarian donations to us, the Tiananmen Mothers group, as this humanitarian aid activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and firmly believe that your good deeds will be recorded in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please understand, my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye said: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in the United States (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-America Chinese Student Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often have cross-overs.

The relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the hands of the victims of the June Fourth incident.
In 1994, upon the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, MCDF subsequently established the "June 4th Elderly and Needy Fund for the Orphans", which has been in operation ever since all the June 4th orphans graduated from university.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from donations made by individuals and society during the June Fourth incident, as well as generous contributions from individuals, and support from the Brother Universities Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the victims of the June Fourth Incident finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June Fourth from Hong Kong.
During this period, "Chinese Human Rights" also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the donation for June 4th for the consideration of the donors. We are indeed a group of retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders and terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately if necessary.
We also express our gratitude and respect to those brave and generous comrades who have been risking their lives for years to deliver humanitarian aid.

Package price: 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the rabbit's comments. I originally thought that rejecting the ancient style was not suitable for it, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks for Dan Dan's recognition, your satisfaction will give us the energy to move forward, we will keep working hard!
This photography studio is really great, highly recommend all buddies to come!
Everything from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production is impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will match a suitable makeup style for you according to your preferences. The makeup products used are also top-notch brands.
As for Teacher Tian Liang, his photography skills are quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats playing around.
We work in Beijing, and the better photography studios here require a six-month advance booking. Some of my colleagues have had their photos taken in Beijing, but the final results were just so so.
I deliberately sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
"Our facial expression management is relatively poor, which we believe is also a shortcoming for most people. Photographer Liang will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments."

Everyone around us, including ourselves, can't stop praising it when it comes out.
I have already recommended my best friend to go, and she just watched the film and is equally delighted.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried and that more people will discover it, creating their own unique style instead of following the same old formula.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and we always put in 200% effort to complete the work as long as the customer likes it. Grateful for the acquaintance and encounter.
Sweet and considerate assistants, as well as lively and cheerful photographer teachers, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, and I am very grateful to all of you. 😘😘
Thank you for Xiaoyu's comments. It's also fate to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you and hope to visit Qinhuangdao again next time.

If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the money spent on training is very high, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline, training is an excellent choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is certainly a very important thing.
Firstly, it is necessary to consider the teaching staff of the institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, the training institution will be meaningless. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have particularly strong teaching staff.
Before making a choice, it is advisable to inquire about the training institution and ideally, to inquire about the students who have come out of the institution. After all, only the institution's students know how good or bad the teaching courses are.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't provided enough information about your personal situation, and learning this thing is closely related to one's own circumstances.
For example, your profession, age, desired language to learn, and even the city you are in, all have a relationship with the industry you want to study or engage in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you have already graduated in computer science, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. There are many offline and online training institutions that are actually very good, but the cost of learning is high and the time investment is relatively high. It usually takes 3-6 months of concentrated training.
However, if it's the situations I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available on the internet, or you can also find training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can contact me through my profile to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of learning costs in terms of time and money, it is recommended to learn from training institutions. This way, learning will not be too difficult, the teachers will explain in detail, and there will be someone dedicated to answering questions. Additionally, it can be helpful in terms of learning planning and supervision.
Many training institutions now sign employment agreements and have referral quotas, recommending students to companies after they have completed their studies, which can save a lot of trouble in the job search and interview process.
The above are my opinions. As I don't know your situation well, I only provided a brief introduction and it may not be detailed enough. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to contact me for further discussion.
I said to arrive before 1 o'clock, and I saw it on the app.
"What does it mean?"
"I haven't finished speaking, what are you doing?"
I undertake various services including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall-mounted boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional caulking, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently give me likes, and for working hard for life. Life is tiring, but we must continue.
Life will not let down anyone who makes efforts. If you like, please follow me. Thanks to those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, we have to bear the process alone. In the face of life, besides being strong, we have no choice but to continue. The road can be looked back upon, but cannot be walked back upon.
Cleaning is not only a job, but also a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful because of service, and service becomes wonderful because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest job, as cleaners, we will clean every corner of our clients' homes with the utmost care and attention. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up from our clients makes all the exhaustion worth it. Our hard work will eventually pay off!
My daily work.
"Your request, my service."
Serve with heart, clean with heart, retain the beauty.
Fenggui Housekeeping takes care of the details you care about, and we strive to provide a clean and loving home.
"Keep your home clean, establish a household reputation, provide excellent service, and ensure cleanliness at home."
Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily work.
Although crystal chandeliers are gorgeous, they will become dull and lackluster if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly. Life is the same.
Only by doing it with heart can we succeed, only by being meticulous can we create delicacy, and we are serious about the beauty of the seams.
Give me a chance and I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself, and professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough to work in any industry these days!
"But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance, and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!"
"The plan for the day is determined by the morning, and all the goodness starts from the morning. I hope you set off with happiness, luck, health, and good wishes, and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning."
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed and having it made us happy; as we grew up, happiness became a goal to achieve and achieving it made us happy; but as we mature, we realize that happiness is actually a state of mind and understanding it brings happiness.
Be the most authentic and kind version of yourself, follow your heart and live without regrets in this lifetime; Life is a journey, walk your own path; There are two treasures in life: good health and a good mood, live beautifully until old age!
At every stage of life, one will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since we cannot avoid it, we might as well face it calmly.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face challenges head-on, the problem will eventually be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia join hands to hold the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua News Agency.
RIYADH, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on Nov. 11 in the JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
The biennial exhibition is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyu, the director of UCCA, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," "Inheriting as Experiment," "Thinking on the Edge," "Moving towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, and some artists use recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing's "Endless Mountains and Rivers" series (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials.
Barclay, CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, expressed his hope that this year's biennial exhibition could establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction and exchange.
Tian Feiyu said, "The goal of the biennial is twofold, both to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to enable Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial exhibition period, where artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua News Agency.
KUNMING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare positions in rural areas to promote rural revitalization and help consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation and employment assistance for the poor.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used to provide employment for poverty-stricken laborers and other rural disadvantaged groups, playing an important role in helping poverty-stricken people increase their income through employment, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation is jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc., mainly to unify and regulate the scope of recruitment for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level, fund management, position development, and position management.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations specify that the principle of "setting posts according to needs, determining personnel based on posts, dynamic management, and overall control of the total number", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management" should be followed.
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, public announcement, employment, pre-job training, and job assignment.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that the development departments of each rural public welfare position should purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare positions; and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.
The address is wrong.
Hello.
Can the order be cancelled?
"I will place a new order."
Has it been canceled?
Although the right-wing has had periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly with a little bit of sunshine, but sweat with a little bit of hot water. They are quick to desire more when they have achieved something, and quick to abandon their cause when faced with setbacks.
To be truthful, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied in defining the standards of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy and improving technology, promoting institutionalization of the political system, and safeguarding human rights.
3. Personally, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his opinions and respect him as a person because he is serious, serious about China, and takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and political groups with mixed motives. Furthermore, foreign powers may take advantage of the situation.
4. To bring about change or improvement in China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Those who attempt political opportunism and seek personal gain are not right-wing, but rather scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left again.
The left is actually a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left does not have this opportunity because what the left wants is precisely what the Communist Party has discarded!
5. Recently, I have seen some friends arguing with anti-fascists while refuting leftist extremism, and they seem quite agitated. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or lunatics, they are stubborn and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the rebels and leftists to admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this way: When the rebels call you a fifty-cent party and the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals or pursue them and become paranoid.
"As ideals drift further away, even the dragon slayer may eventually become a dragon."
I think "left and right" generally refers to constraint and freedom. Due to China's inherent cultural and historical genes, the country as a whole tends to lean towards the left.
The domestic right-wing emphasizes freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing advocates for strengthened regulation, greater emphasis on fairness and safety.
Currently, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, and with the ongoing conflict between China and the United States, a left-leaning stance is certain, and it is expected to continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
No more words need to be said, Hua Hua is just that righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and containment of Huawei chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "American" companies.
The United States is suppressing China's chip industry, demanding that its own companies and allied countries' related enterprises simultaneously block China's chip industry, directly resulting in the impact on global chip suppliers' orders and profits, causing a decrease in research and development investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing enterprises, thus causing a disruption in the global chip supply chain due to shortages.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to various industries around the world, such as car manufacturers halting production and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", more and more technology giants in various countries are moving towards the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly grasp the global semiconductor control and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit", inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and providing funding to support American technology giants. For example, the veteran American technology giant Intel has invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, and has opened up chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and could possibly take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason for such certainty is that Intel, as an old-tech giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of talented teams and technological reserves, and is sure to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement about Intel's move to build a wafer factory, saying without hesitation: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because he still bears a grudge against the conflict between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a gem in the crown of American manufacturing, occupying a dominant position at the top of the global market and reigning as the world's semiconductor leader.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where a single factory was responsible for the entire process of chip design, manufacturing, and testing, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model is too burdensome for some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are deterred by the huge costs of building production lines.
Under the influence of market demand, the chip industry began to show a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation in the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he believed that since there were specialized designers, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Morris Chang's vision became a reality and TSMC was born.
TSMC has focused its main business on "wafer processing", a single link, without design, only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, newly established TSMC was just a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only focused on the manufacturing aspect of the chip industry, they obviously had a high opinion of themselves and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
"Zhāng Zhōngmóu also believed that Intel at that time looked down upon wafer fabrication services."
It is unexpected that the giants who looked down upon wafer manufacturing services in the past are now starting to engage in wafer foundry services.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel is entering the foundry business.
TSMC's market value has now surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally cannot afford to be complacent.
Now, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to surpass.
"I can't wait anymore."
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "weird hot searches".
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly selecting three hot topics: "Dragon Raising its Head on the Second Day of the Second Lunar Month", "Hao Li You Price Increase", and "Huo La La Incident", public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then the index decreases (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small camel hump appearing again.
They look exactly the same as the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in a "solitary peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff-like" pattern.
"Solitary peak" refers to artificially heating up and quickly climbing the hot search rankings, attracting public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff-like" refers to collective evacuation, where the hot search has served its "function" and moves on to a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, down to the second, indicating that it is definitely the same group of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches simultaneously appear on the list, some attracting attention, some responsible for popularizing knowledge, some inciting controversy, some diverting attention, some affecting cognition, some misleading judgment, some inciting emotions, and some influencing decision-making. Black industry accounts are divided into batches and nodes for precise operations, considering almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
"Propagation is a science that, without subjective factors such as position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide."
"Wherever you go, leave a trail. The kind of trail that others want to follow. Together, let's uncover those trails."

Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of Omicron variant infections - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's foreign correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of COVID-19 variant Omicron infections.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time on December 10th.
According to Health Minister Kailash Jagutpal, one infected person is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa, while the other infected person is a local resident who tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30 after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, both infected individuals' nucleic acid test results have turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed 3 cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time.
All three of them are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. They were all mild cases and did not require hospitalization.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government of Seychelles is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter Seychelles by plane will need to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense.
On the 10th, the Serbian Ministry of Health also announced that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, announced on the 9th that the country has detected three cases of the Omicron variant for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and identified these 3 cases of infection.

"Receiving is a money belly." (Note: This phrase does not have a direct translation in English and may not make sense without context.)
The order is for chicken feet.
"Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#."
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
"I #NAME# called your staff to explain."
Your rider told me that the address is too far.
DaMei 360 integrates home decoration.
Address: 12th floor, Xingfu Jiayuan, No. 156 Huancheng South Road.
At first, it was through a friend's introduction and trust that I chose to come and take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
As soon as they entered the store, a series of scams began.
This is my first time visiting the store and I only showed them my floor plan. They didn't actually measure the house, but they were able to give me a quote and said they could handle my 135 square meter house for 70,000 yuan. They showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that once you step into the store, they will drag you into paying a deposit (and once you pay, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you how much discount.
"This is just a big trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. In a moment of impulsiveness, I paid a deposit of over ten thousand yuan."
The quote he gave me has a lot of issues - 70,000 yuan does not include any water or electricity renovations, nor does it include any doors, cabinets, or bathrooms, which are the major costs of basic installation.
Apart from that, their service charges are also higher than those of other companies.
"I have lost trust in this company, they made me sign a contract without explaining anything clearly from the beginning."
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced and had a specialized team to deal with you.
No matter what, biting the bullet is the customer's problem and they are completely blameless.
There are various excuses and many details that I don't want to go into. It's all tears. In short, don't choose them because my friend had them renovate their house and the quality was poor, and they charged various fees later on.
"Damn it, they are the same dragon head decoration that used to cheat people, now changed to Da Mei, and it seems like they have closed down again and changed to something else."
So everyone, don't choose such a crappy decoration company.
In the future, when making choices, everyone should search and consult more on these matters on Baidu, because home renovation is not a small expense.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
Posting any form of merchant reviews is strictly prohibited. For more details, please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement.
Dianping Kunming Decoration and Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of DAMEI 360 Integrated Home Decoration. For finding a decoration company, come to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it's not delivered within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If I don't receive a refund within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes.
The spicy chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, so I couldn't eat it.
Starry Night has an appointment | Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
The Gemini meteor shower photographed by Beijing amateur astronomer An Ju in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent bodies of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "nurtured" by a comet.
Shiu Lipeng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomy popularization expert, explained that like a blockbuster movie, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and its "release period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroids move at a slower speed, are colorful, and there are also many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and beginner astrophotography.
"The Gemini meteor shower was captured by astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin."
According to astronomical forecasts, this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions when the radiant point is directly overhead) of 150 at its maximum.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index chart.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower, known for its "falling petals," left a deep impression on people, but this year's shower will be affected by moonlight interference, which will slightly reduce its brilliance.
On the 14th day of the lunar calendar, which is the 11th day of the 11th lunar month, the moon phase is a waxing gibbous moon. The bright moonlight may interfere with observations, but fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them during the few hours after the moon sets in the late night, but be sure to keep warm and protect against the cold.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. Instead, choose a location with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast in the suburbs or countryside. Then, patiently wait for the moon to set and observe with the naked eye."
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a high flow rate in all directions, so there is no need to constantly stare at the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower during observation.
Friends who like photography should choose wide-angle and large aperture lenses to shoot stunning "meteor shower films". Use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
"Considering stability and continuity, tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential."
"Xiu Lipeng reminds."
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the questioner should be referring to LCD TVs, and the main differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs are as follows:
Firstly, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the widespread market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs clearly focus more on the large screen market, or laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TVs are generally over 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs have been continuously increasing globally, accounting for over 60% of the overall sales of TVs with a size of 80 inches or above.
According to Zhong Yikang's forecast, the sales growth of laser TVs in 2020 will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for such good performance in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent eye protection performance of laser TV.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, which is closer to the natural imaging process of objects compared to the backlight emission of LCD TVs, and also causes less stimulation to the eyes.
The Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and ophthalmology experts from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a rigorous comparative test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
In the current context where visual health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current price of laser TVs on the market is mostly over ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, laser TVs have a shorter projection distance compared to traditional projection devices, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience in a small space with a compact host.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can achieve over 2000 lumens.
In addition, with lower heat generation and less damage to equipment, the lifespan of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, which can provide users with more stunning audiovisual experiences.
It's not a matter of false demand, but rather a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and cost-effectiveness, laser TVs are not suitable for audiovisual enthusiasts who want to balance large screens and viewing environments. However, if you weigh the pros and cons and make your own judgment, you can try it out. The key is not to blindly believe one-sided arguments.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle short-throw projector - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
To block out some ambient light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel screens comes at a high cost, with the price of an 80-inch screen being roughly equivalent to that of a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I particularly dislike projection manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light, and the light reflected onto the ceiling is not visible to the eyes. Even if you insist on comparing it to LCD TVs, it is still diffuse "direct light". When you turn on the TV, the ceiling is also illuminated, isn't it?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusive, it cannot form a proper image.
The thermal spot (light spot) effect of high gain projection screens has been precisely overlooked, and it is truly uncomfortable when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle.
The Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery's quality store is currently without branches.
After adding her on WeChat to schedule a date, the young lady promptly sent me a list of available times and responded to my messages in a timely manner.
Before going, I looked at the store's portfolio, which mostly featured outdoor wedding dresses and was beautifully shot, with a variety of styles.
After arriving that day, I briefly communicated my ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was indecisive about, and finally we settled on the makeup and styling. Before the photographer started shooting, he arranged some props and guided my movements, and he was also very meticulous about every detail.
However, it may be because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, so what was captured is not the style I wanted, but it should still be beautiful. 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help select the pictures and communicate about the post-production style. It feels quite attentive.
The repaired film will take about half a month, let's wait for the result~
I won the second free photo shoot event again, and most of the clothes in the entire venue can be chosen for the shoot.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon dress to try out a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is my younger brother who was born in the 1995s. He seems a bit inexperienced, but I hope he can provide more suggestions for customers in terms of shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative, and the shooting process is relatively pleasant.
WenShe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery selects quality stores.
It's on the homepage, come take a look at Queenie too~
I filled in my name and phone number when I arrived at the store, then chose clothing. I could choose any wedding dress, and the staff was patient when I changed outfits three or four times. After making my selection, I spent a long time getting my makeup done. The service was excellent, and during the shoot, they taught me how to pose. However, my face looked too big in the photos, but the staff said they would retouch them in half a month. Surprisingly, they sent the edited photos in just three or four days, and they looked almost identical to the original ones.
[Environment] Overall, it's okay.
There are many clothing options available.
There are approximately three makeup stations, and inside is a photography studio.
"The service is very enthusiastic and attentive."
The stylist is quite patient.
Photographers will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If unsatisfied, the photographer will also proactively suggest a reshoot.
"The experience may have gone a bit overboard, as my double eyelids were taped into triple eyelids."
The tail of the eyebrows was also shaved, which is a bit awkward for those who don't usually draw their eyebrows.
The photos were given about ten days ago, but the photo editing effect is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried two sets and ended up choosing the black dress after much deliberation. The saleswoman said it had a more Hepburn-esque vintage feel.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist were both very patient and helped me a lot. The result was very satisfying.
After finishing my hair and makeup, we started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the entire process, making it a relaxed and harmonious experience.
After carefully selecting four favorite photos for retouching after the shoot, the young man said the finished product would be ready within 15 minutes, and the result was very satisfying.
It has been 3 days without a response... I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system cannot recognize my credit card.
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
"Can I be exempted first and then pay my monthly fee after you finish your investigation? Is that okay?"
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
"Xiaoyusan is an internet insurance brokerage platform."
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key requirements must be met: shareholders, initiators have no major illegal records in the past three years, a minimum registered capital of RMB 50 million is required, and approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission is necessary.
These three requirements are actually very strict, summarized as having strength, being approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) that regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide, and having shareholders with good conduct. As a insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance does not need to be questioned too much about whether it is legitimate or not, because not every insurance company can meet these three requirements.
At this point, it's good and reliable.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, where many companies' star critical illness insurance policies are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched HeTai Super Mary No. 5 critical illness insurance policy, with both the claims and underwriting parties being HeTai Life Insurance, and Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment methods, internet platform products generally have a higher cost-effectiveness due to the absence of operating expenses for physical branches and the cost of sales staff salaries. Additionally, the flexible payment options, such as monthly payments, reduce the payment pressure on policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
"Can be considered."
From the perspective of the professionalism of salespeople, this is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism. Many internet products allow customers to purchase insurance themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings, especially in terms of health information and occupation. Non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when purchasing insurance, thinking that they are healthy or qualified, which can lead to many hidden risks in claims and the possibility of being denied coverage.
I myself have worked as an insurance telesales agent at "Tencent Micro Insurance" (similar to Xiaoyusan, an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can responsibly tell everyone.
Internet insurance is genuine and reliable, but it is the people who are unreliable. The internet channel lacks professional practitioners and there are many sales misrepresentations.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance and get a free phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness coverage for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they tend to overlook important details. They do not inform policyholders that the first month is only 1 yuan, and subsequent months will be charged at normal rates, ranging from tens to 200 yuan. Many customers are unaware of what they have purchased after paying premiums for one or two years.
Thought it would only cost 1 yuan and the insurance company would compensate 6 million yuan (a pie in the sky).
"Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers with endings such as 6666 or 8888, and if a winning message is sent, there will be no reminder or exchange if the recipient does not claim it themselves."
"For the policyholder, this is another pitfall - receiving 60,000 yuan of critical illness coverage for free, but it is only short-term. If one relies solely on this and does not have any other commercial insurance, in the event of a real critical illness, what can 60,000 yuan do? It cannot solve the problem and one's future life will be exposed."
Currently, the government is also cracking down on misleading internet insurance sales.
So overall, the platform and products are not the issue, but rather the professionalism and ethical standards of the salespeople.
It is suggested that the topic owner carefully consider the overall situation. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products also have better cost-effectiveness than internet products.
I have personally assisted 59 internet clients to purchase offline insurance products, saving each person an average of 2000-3000 yuan per year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, served nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on their needs. During the insurance process, I will compare and strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After purchasing insurance, I will organize and manage policies for customers, allowing them to be worry-free.
Grow together with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of insurance regulatory authorities, internet insurance refers to insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance procedures after clicking on the insurance application link.
During this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the process of purchasing insurance online may lack a sense of ceremony, and may not even involve printing a paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but purchasing insurance in this way may have a fatal problem, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we purchase insurance, we should seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later.

No problem, please don't arrange for a resend. I have already purchased it elsewhere and don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate these villains.
If we don't consider political parties and factions, what we should resist first is this uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending me friend requests on Facebook, followed by posting sarcastic posts, to attempting to share my home location and father's name on social media, I have chosen not to respond.
Afterwards, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to shamelessly discuss some obscure and humiliating comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, fertility, and even whether or not I should be planted with strawberries in bed. I...forget it.
Later on, I received messages from several friends about a photo of you uploaded on your Facebook account along with sexually harassing comments.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my reporting to the police was uploaded, you did not show any restraint at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your social status, in our society, mutual respect between genders is necessary.
Yes, you can continue with these sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting comments. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me. You can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you made the image or continue to make all kinds of attacking remarks.
That's right, I can't and don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and physique do not require your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to be so humiliated by others in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
"I said it's good, but you wouldn't believe me."
I don't think any girl could be bullied like that and still say that she's okay.
In the workplace, society, politics or business, only those who lack basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people.
I have selected some messages for everyone to review.
No one should be able to impersonate you in the posts you've made yourself.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
A knowing smile.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the third Vietnam National Forum on Digital Technology Enterprise Development.
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two main conferences were held to discuss topics related to the digital technology industry and the country's digital transformation, as well as the role of digital technology enterprises in the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic economic recovery and development.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that in 2021, despite the ongoing spread of COVID-19, the number and revenue of Vietnam's digital technology companies continue to grow at nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products cultivated in Vietnam has increased, focusing on solving major challenges faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Manh Hung calls on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing the country's digital transformation platform, and taking on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on the national mission.
On the forum, leaders from various departments and government agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals who are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology, are sharing their ideas and solutions for mobilizing and gathering all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, working together to promote national digital transformation, and achieving breakthroughs and solutions for post-epidemic economic recovery and other challenges.
Premier Van Mung-Ching emphasized during the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are for everyone, so it is necessary to mobilize everyone to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, target, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and businesses.
Premier Wen Jiabao emphasized that digital transformation should embody the national spirit, with internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term, and decisive factors, and external forces as important breakthroughs.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive deepening and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome natural resource depletion, and help green transformation and develop green energy.
The digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases that protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and other related aspects, and promotes the digital transformation of fields such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country increasingly prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng has requested that governments at all levels, organizations, and enterprises increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to establish and improve systems related to digital transformation, strengthen national management, and actively promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Vietnam Manufacturing" Excellent Digital Product Awards ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnam Manufacturing" Digital Product Exhibition.

Address: No. 555 Gaotie North Road, View Map.
Here, the home appliances are quite complete, with numerous brands and all well-known brands.
During the Double Twelve period, visit the "Hansdon" water purifier store to check out their water purifiers. The store is currently running a promotion with discounted prices.
There are a total of 11 floors in the Grandview Mall, with parking available from the -2nd to the 9th floor. Both the -1st and -2nd floors are designated parking areas, and parking is free during the day.
The surroundings are not great, with only a few restaurants and hardware stores, and the food at the restaurants is just average.
This elevator is also speechless, like having a serious illness, going back and forth between floors -2 and -1, constantly ignoring the floor I pressed. Going down from the emergency exit to the first floor is also speechless, as it leads directly to a furniture store that is closed, and the emergency exit cannot be opened!
The Home Inn still needs improvement, as there are many areas that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555, North High-speed Railway Road, Shayibake District. Convenient transportation, large parking lot, and free during the day.
Environment: To be honest, the store is large with 8-9 floors, and you can find all kinds of furniture, household appliances, and various small items that you want to buy at home. Many famous brand merchants have settled in the store, such as Mousse, OPPEIN, Vatti, Boss, Peak Home, Hansdon, Yake, Youbang, Silian, Fupinju, Wanjiale, Nature, Zhonglian, Midea, Yadang... There are really too many brands, and I can only remember so many. It is a good place to buy products, and you can sit on the sofa and rest when you are tired of shopping.
Recently, I've been thinking about buying a comfortable sofa. My friend said there are many sofas to choose from here. I've looked at Gujia Home and Meikemei Home, and they seem okay, but the prices are a bit high, so I'm still undecided.
Dianping's Urumqi home furnishings market channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Gaotie Juran Home. If you are looking for a decoration company, just go to Dianping.
My guest has already been given it, and #PRS_ORG# cannot pull it off.

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas.
Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on December 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operating in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, following the operation of the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province on December 8th.
At this point, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and operated 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were widely recognized by ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, significantly improving the capacity for receiving ship pollutants and shipping services.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for ships and crew members, helping them solve urgent and difficult problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been built and put into operation, integrate living services, production services, and government services, with a focus on green environmental protection and featuring ship repair and emergency rescue services. They will achieve "one-stop service" for ships in the port, making the work and life of sailors who sail on the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and convenient.
Pro-China media outlet Duowei reports the latest news on US-China relations: recent satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to America's allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative", on January 9th, a satellite discovered the US aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform expects that the USS Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft aboard the USS Carl Vinson.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which departed from the United States on January 3, is also cruising in the Pacific Ocean.
The "Lincoln" also carried for the first time the F-35C carrier-based squadron, which belongs to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan is currently deployed by the US Navy in the Asia-Pacific region and is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the missile destroyer "Stockdale".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China, with their most powerful weapons making a rare visit to Guam.
On January 17, 2022, the US military carrier-based transport plane CMV-22B flew over the South China Sea, where three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China, and made a rare visit to Guam, showcasing its most powerful weapons.
According to a report by CNN on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Navy base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The gathering of three US aircraft carriers around China's periphery and the rare visit to Guam by the most powerful weapon is seen as a signal to allies and enemies amid the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region, according to analysis.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China's periphery, and the most powerful weapons are rarely visiting Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the South China Sea.
The US Navy stated in the South China Sea Research Forum that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada" to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrated the US's ability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunderbolt submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Thundering Submarine" the most important survival weapon in the "nuclear triad," which also includes land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in the United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
I talked to my friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the evaporation of $251 billion in market value. Zuckerberg responded that they are facing unprecedented competition. What is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue primarily coming from advertising. As a profitable advertising company, it has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, regardless of their functional positioning, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Moreover, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many apps integrating Meta's ads and monetizing through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
Firstly, due to the changes in Apple's privacy policy, it has become difficult for Meta to obtain user data, which has affected the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly indicating whether users allow apps to access their information. Most people's natural response is to not allow it.
If Google makes another move, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, primarily from companies engaged in overseas business.
Meta has approximately hundreds of employees in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, with most of the money being spent on Meta.
Interestingly, now ByteDance's TikTok is one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years, Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to place advertisements on Meta, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also very good.
Recently, I haven't specifically looked into it, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies burning a large amount of money overseas has passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
"Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are no longer in the hands of Meta."
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth prospects.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but also on the expectations for the future.
It is obvious that the expectations for Meta are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse".
"The metaverse is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story may not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years."
So the next two years are likely to be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success and annual revenue of $100-200 billion, the company is actually very aware of its vulnerabilities and lacks a strong security fortress compared to other internet and high-tech companies.
Although his several social apps currently have high daily active users and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence, and the overturning is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of creating a metaverse is currently unattainable and there is no hope of success in the short term, making Facebook very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg keeps changing the company's name and constantly searching for new paths. However, I believe his choice of path is wrong and it is a dead end. These are just my thoughts for reference.
