"I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€."
"Today it costs 179€."
"I find that honestly quite annoying."
"Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for a better price, or is there another way to get the discount?"
"I think it is generally not a good idea to expect children to take on a parental role for their younger siblings."
However, I believe that taking care of younger siblings in moderation does wonders for older siblings as well.
"Quickly look, quickly help, quickly bring the bottle etc."

"If your cat K1 is happy to be alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good."
You can best determine if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to put K2 to bed and sit with him for hours until he falls asleep.
"Legally, it is probably questionable."
Maybe that's why the statement by the psychologist is also true.
For if something were to actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
"Whether this is a risk you are willing to take is, of course, up to you ;) "
"Please help me find the title of a book again!"
"I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago, and I can still recall most of the plot, but the title just won't come to mind. Maybe someone here knows something..."
The story dealt with fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself with feed and going into the enclosure with his predators.
"The case is taken over by a female detective who, after brief investigation, goes to the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety."
The detective has a small niece who also has a fear of fire and ends up at this therapist's office.
"There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired before every suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document it, and then post the photos on the internet."
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately have to confront their fear to the greatest extent possible.
"A woman jumps out of the window, another one deliberately kills herself."
"This which stands against fear will be referred to in the book as 'the fight.'"
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with the fire.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "That is so the rough action, I am quite sure that the book in the original was written by a French author / authoress."
"If this action is known to someone or if someone even tells me the title of the book, I would be very pleased."
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the WiFi.
"Do I have to contact my husband first?"
"But that can take time."
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?

"The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family."
"By combining a digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, and can thus be installed in nearly any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0."
The LokSound 5 Decoder is offered with all common interfaces and always comes with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker along with a sound capsule kit.
"As with all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder."
He commands the data format DCC just as well as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 drive steps are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses, and up to 32 functions can be performed.
"With RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register with an appropriate digital central."
He can control all DCC programming modes, and with RailCom®, appropriate central stations can read CV values on the main track.
"For central offices that can only program CVs of 1-255, auxiliary registers may exist."
"Motorola® users can benefit from up to 28 drive stages with 255 addresses."
"Three more Motorola® addresses allow for the triggering of 16 functions."
"A built-in programming mode also allows for reprogramming of the venerable Control Unit 6021."
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central systems.
The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC System.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake elements or with direct current.
In addition, he also uses a Selectrix® brake diode.

Due to Omikron: Johnson will drive forward with vaccine updates.
"Always new Omikron cases are causing concern for politics and science in the UK."
"Therefore, all adults in England who qualify should receive an immunization offer by New Year's."
"London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine rollouts in light of rapidly rising omicron numbers, faster than previously planned."
"Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination," said Johnson on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
"So far, the target date has been at the end of January."
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
"Johnson said that we must strengthen the vaccine protection urgently, facing the Omikron variant, which is a emergency."
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's boost now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of Omikron were reported in Great Britain, bringing the total number to 3137.
"In comparison to yesterday, it was a rise of 65 percent."
"Will the full price be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?"

Content Warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in some detail.
"I have to write something for my soul."
"I often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence due to professional reasons."
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs all too frequently is that many victims do not seek help or believe that we cannot help them.
"I am quite clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect."
But there are fewer things that move me more in my profession than when I can't do anything about such situations.
"I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes..."
"But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach all of them."
"I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it."
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that it is worth living without violence for everyone.
"I want all women to know that they do not simply have to take violence."
"I often wish I could help... I know I can't."
It will never become lighter due to this.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth for "League of Legends"?
"Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently started on Netflix. It features a lot of fantasy, complex names, and an awe-inspiring production.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
"Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim"
At least on young man named Johannes Patrick, he could rely on.
"Nothing again: The giants in Crailsheim lost for the second time in less than three months - and how!"
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had reflected on the cup defeat early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, saying: "We still have some anger in our stomach."
She didn't lay down after the game, but actually increased her intensity in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
"While more than the bare result, the manner and style of the performance disappointed."
The phrase "Stellvertretend sei eine Statistik genannt, die das gesamte Dilemma ausdrückt: Die Dreier-Quote betrug gerade einmal 13 Prozent, 4 Treffer (allesamt vom jungen Johannes Patrick) bei sage und schreibe 31 Versuchen - noch Fragen?" can be translated to English as: "A statistic that represents the entire dilemma is called: The three-point percentage was just 13%, 4 shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions?"
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not concentrated enough after our victory at Tenerife, and failed to carry out what we had trained for."
To move the ball, specifically.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "It's a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
"On Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, only 750 visitors were admitted, but they came at their own expense."
"Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided his team's game."
"The best playmaker I have ever coached," praised Gleim even more.
"While the star performers in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed to deliver on the entire line."
"Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and managed to get within eight points, after already being behind by 39:59."
"Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points."
Unfortunately, there is not much time left for arguing.
"Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.) the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, and then also in Ludwigsburg they will have a maximum of 750 spectators."
"We had a different email address before, but I changed it."
"Yes, I have already registered a few months ago."
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
"We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again as a result."
"We have registered ourselves originally half a year ago."
"Stets wie aus dem Ei gepellt: Max Raabe wird 59" can be translated to "Always popped out like from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59."
He can delight his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
"At present, he is traveling with the program 'Good day, dear luck' - if he is allowed to perform."
In actuality, Max Raabe had intended to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
"But nothing comes of it."
The planned concert has been rescheduled to May 2022 due to government instructions to contain the COVID-19 virus.
Other appearances planned by him during the Advent season will have to be postponed for now, as stated on the singer's website, who turns 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting from January, the artists plan to make up for their performances that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has loved to sing since his youth.
"He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with his fellow students."
"Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists."
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place in the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has taken it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always impeccably dressed, with his blonde hair strictly styled back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe cannot be forgotten in the current German-speaking music scene.
"With the program 'Guten Tag, liebes Glück,' he has been on tour since 2020."
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance?

"Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: By expropriation, no new apartment is created."
The new Federal Housing Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded by a popular vote in Berlin.
"With expropriation, no new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
"My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will be affordable in the coming years."
"A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations is actually the best protection against monopoly formation."
"In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and the Left Party will establish an expert commission to determine how to handle the results of the national referendum."
"However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the coalition government on further tightening of rental regulations."
The coalition agreement sees a rent brake until 2029, a limitation on rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
"I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible."
"If the rental market does not relax despite this, 'we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps', emphasized the SPD politician."
Hello, I wanted to place an order and I realized a few days ago that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.

"I have already cut myself on the finger."
"That is sheer impudence."
At least 100 people were killed by tornadoes in Kentucky.
"During a devastating tornado outbreak, numerous tornadoes have swept across the United States."
"Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths to mourn."
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
"On the night leading up to Saturday, multiple tornadoes have caused severe damage in the USA and may have resulted in up to a hundred fatalities."
"The storms leave a devastating trail of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky."
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had swept through, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
"It is hard to imagine that it is even possible."
He is calculating alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred deaths, the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they sold Vitrine #NAME# out.
"That is very unfortunate."

"If delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!"
"I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and have it shipped to Germany in the cart?"
"I have submitted a return through the contact form and would like to inquire if it has been received or processed, as I have not yet received any confirmation."
"Companies pay vaccine premiums and change slogans."
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine reward, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering money rewards to their employees for getting vaccinated.
"By doing so, they are on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who called for financial incentives for vaccination today."
"Even the rewording of slogans into vaccine appeals - modeled after the German example - is intended to increase readiness for COVID-19 vaccinations."
He has switched jobs to a company he has criticized.

"We will review the quality and completeness of your order."
The new coffee espresso machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee to your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matt colors in combination with the matt brushed stainless steel front, make the new SMEG coffee machine with milk frother a design object.
According to the reduced design, all functions such as coffee strength and water amount, as well as the selection between espresso, americano, ristretto, or a mild coffee with only four buttons can be selected.
"Thanks to the steam plant, specialties such as coffee milk and milk foam can also be prepared."
"Help with first own campaign"
The English translation of "Boron zum Grusse!" is "Long live boron!"
"I am currently leading an adventure over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends, and I want to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a campaign specifically written for players."
"We are playing DSA 5."
"The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been planned, and now I am working on the opening adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter."
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to deliver a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
"Where the further development of the action should take place."
"Several miles from the village, the hero should be ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush."
"I want to give the player characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in various ways: to convince, to act, to threaten, to recognize the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to the players' minds."
Group strength: 8 regular Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers armed.
"Upon failure to notice, goblins ambush the hero in a hollow way and surround him with bows to the left and right, while two with spears stop the carriage."
"Should it come to battle and the heroes be defeated, I have two solutions in mind."
"All the heroes are found unconscious and subsequently discovered by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf, and are healed."
"The cart is naturally gone."
"Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf will summon two of his servants and come to the aid of the hero in battle."
"The cart is still there, everything is great."
"How appropriate do you find the Deus ex Machina solution from Lösung 2?"
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into adventure?
The Goblin group will later play a crucial role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
"EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips."
"I will definitely adopt many of your ideas and also have more confidence in my narratives again."

"I am fed up with Sky Sport F1."
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has continued to deteriorate, so I'm using this post to vent a little.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to start the F1 pre-report on time.
Although the start was delayed and there was an accident, the timeline was still behind schedule, but they could have still shown the last ten minutes as well as the championship decision.
"However, it seems that F1 has priority by law and therefore everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE here probably had no choice."
"Still stupid, especially since Sky UK ended up broadcasting the race."
"Despite a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well."
"There was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag."
Although it has already happened in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both drivers only came to the decision that Verstappen could change the tires when there were appropriate radio messages about this topic directed at Hamilton.
"Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen."
"I believe that one should simply know such elementary rules if they are commenting on F1 at a pay-TV channel."
"It is not the first time that puzzle-solving has been carried out according to the rules that are now possible or prescribed, both of them have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules."
In general, the artificial commenting style of Roos does not appeal to me, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste.
"But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better."
"In addition, there are constant foolishnesses that both simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher."
The latter causes a lot of disturbance in the comment, which apparently does not take it seriously.
"Not only does advertising simply take over at Sky, but in the final lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available immediately after the race."
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
"Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1."
"Unironically, RTL does a better job at the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising."
"Therefore, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster."
"I would be interested in your opinion."
"Here: #PRS\_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1"
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week but still hasn't been delivered.
"I have contacted the chat twice and still nothing."
The translation of the sentence is:  "The First Lady told me that it will be shipped on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will review and send an email and she has never replied."
"Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on 12.12.19."
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole on the front part of the chair).
"Ich bitte um Unterstützung." 的英语翻译是 "I am requesting assistance."
"Blower pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium."
It is also possible to operate a filter system using airlifts.
"This series is offered in 3 variants by us."
"Look at the end of the offer in the table."
"You can compare the performances there."
"Are the pumps powerful enough to operate the entire system?"
"Owning a large aquarium, suitable pumps with 2 or more outlets are needed so that multiple filters can be connected."
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model of the pump. But fans can also be added to create an accent in the aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that converts bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar to name.
The MK series has a special sound-absorbing construction, which leads to low operating noise.
"The installation is very easy."
The fan pump is connected to an air hose 4/6 mm in diameter...and it's ready to go.
"The submersible pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside."
"Sitzt die Lüfterpumpe tiefer als der Wasserstand sollte man ein Rückschlagventil dazwischen setzen."
"Cut the air mattress simply by puncturing it and placing the valve in between."
"This would prevent water from flowing backward, which is the water flowing out of the pond through the pump..."
"Should the air pump be installed outdoors, as with other air pumps, it should be covered and protected from moisture."
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we specify a processing time of 3 days on eBay, packages are processed daily and picked up daily as well.
"Everything is going well on the way, it's moving very quickly."
"We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is offended because it took a little longer this time."
"It is as if not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry...of course, the Corona virus makes no difference here."
Please do not rate it poorly just because delivery is delayed. This is solely due to the package services.
"Man naturally likes to criticize these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard."
"This is also very different regionally."
"Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again."
"How long does it take to order yellow ones with and without armrests?"
Can you also order the legs here?

"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
"Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder."
According to Blue Origin, they were in space for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who was named after the Blue Origin rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineering engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
"How much they paid for their ticket each, Blue Origin did not share."
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
"He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments."
"You were just along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh."
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator would rather return to space again, he said.
"New Shepard" flies up to a height of 100 kilometers.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket and reached a height of approximately 100 kilometers above the Earth, with weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes as it landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
"It was already the third human spaceflight of Blue Origin: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman."
"During the second week of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the vice president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers, were present."
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

"I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I find the subject quite interesting overall, and I don't mind the lab work (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical)."
"I have, of course, also informed myself about career prospects before studying, but at the time, I also thought that I would definitely study until I got my PhD and would."
At present, I am having doubts, especially the career prospects are depressing me.
On the one hand, you always hear about great career opportunities (such as Studycheck etc.) and the profession is said to be highly sought after. On the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paying jobs.

"Extra Stress vor Ferien & Feiertag-Wochenenden" can be translated to "Extra Stress before Holidays & Weekends" in English.
"This topic came up with me last week."
"But I had to use my long weekend to relax now."
Provide a translation for this sentence: "Darum erst jetzt ein Pfosten dazu."
"Not only do we experience great stress not only during major holidays, such as Christmas vacation."
"As it seems, there are also public holidays and bridge days before weekends."
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridging day, which is semi-official because of it.
"Last week, a long 4-day weekend also came into the house."
What happened last week?
The English translation of "Überall Stress" is "Stress everywhere."
"Urgent emails that had to be sent before takeoff, orders here and there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend."
"Weil... ja weil?" can be translated to "Why... because why?" in English.
"Why does 'next week then' sound so strange after so much time has passed?"
"Or because people want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal one?"
"Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also mightily annoyed."
What is the reason for this self-restraint on holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come unexpectedly, all colleagues were quite independent in handling it.
"My question is simply: Are we the only ones who are Swiss?"
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?

The English translation of the sentence is:  "DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was in operation in Silesia and Central Germany, is a very rare locomotive that is likely to have come from the modification proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and defects as shown in the photos, functioning well. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy goods electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network. Possibly, the
"A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and it is operational after being overhauled."
In 1924, the German Reich Railway Company commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
"As the highest speed was demanded."
In March 1926, the DRG determined that the delivery of the 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG would be accompanied by the delivery of the mechanical parts by Siemens-Schuckertwerke, and the electrical parts by AEG.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were assigned the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived World War II and were found again on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered as reparations to the Soviet Union.
"They returned to Germany by November 1952."
"The Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau has determined the repair worthiness of all six locomotives."
"As the progressive electrification of the central German network led to an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors."
"At first, the larger quantities of E 04, E 44, and E 94 were prioritized for assembly."
Only when it became clear that the processing number could no longer be further increased did the E 95 come into focus for processing.
"First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway maintenance facility."
"They came to the railway maintenance depot Halle P in 1960."
"They were usually deployed in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal heading towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt."
"As the age increased, the complicated control of the locomotives became a problem."
It often happened that Schütze would get stuck while performing switching operations.
Then the fireman who constantly traveled on this locomotive had to use a hammer and wooden mallet to release the safety catch during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to prolonged outages for the locomotive.
At the end of the 1960s, sufficient new locomotives were available and there was no clear expansion of the electrical operation planned, so that the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the branch lines, resulting in the E 95 being taken out of service.
There was also the issue that the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one man on board, which would have created a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
"After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, the E 95 01 followed them as the last one, retiring from service on October 5, 1970."
"The intended new designation 255 001 was never used."
"All the locomotives were dismantled, except for the E 95 02."
The E 95 02 was placed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a track heating unit at the main railway station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
"In 1979, the external processing of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it as an exhibit at the RAW Dessau vehicle show."
"She has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive since then."
"1986 saw the completion of the internal combustion engine."
"In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is museally cared for."
"Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P tradition community have been working on the operational readiness of the locomotive."
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with its new inner and outer paint, and the transformers were inspected, with five motors being operational.
"The locomotives were in operation on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements."
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
Main area of deployment was initially Silesia.
The translation of the sentence is:  "Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to do optical reworking on the loco in own work, dusted, with tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition- possibly the building kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN."

"The central beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, they are unfortunately produced."
The middle beam does not fit properly into the intended bracket.
"Also, I receive new ones."
What is the meaning of this sentence in English?
"no flat"
"That is, according to the assembly instructions, they are the right ones in terms of form, but they were only too narrow."

"Residential fire with two minor injuries and significant damage."
"Two people have been slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria."
"In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday."
The fire seems to have spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the reports, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not initially suspect arson.

"To counteract fake news, the CEO of Biontech published a vaccine photo."
"Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network 'LinkedIn' in early 2021."
"Biontech-CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously publicly disclosed his vaccine status."
The entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
"The illness of a friend has moved him to share, said Şahin."
"The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against COVID-19."
"There were false rumors on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated."
"Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated in order to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that one of my old schoolmates is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe COVID-19 illness and has been hooked up to a breathing machine for three weeks.
"The school friend and his family were not vaccinated," Şahin added.
He did not ask about the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
"Angst can be difficult to combat with facts alone, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences."
"In the internet, a circulating interview with Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated."
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legal for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is prioritization in the immunization of vaccines.
"Meanwhile, prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the CEO of Biontech has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements."
"Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power"
"In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases also no heating."
A brand had a substation knocked out.
"After a fire with heavy damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours."
"Through the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communities on Friday evening."
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous backup power sources had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance was finally fully resolved in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities.
"The authorities provided after-school care places in schools and called for neighborly assistance."
The supplier expressed gratitude to the affected individuals for their patience and to the helpers for their efforts.
"We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions."
"We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire services, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The translation of the sentence is: "The repair of the damage will take several more days, as the Westnetz electricians had to temporarily reopen some cables, he explained."
"A technical defect caused the fire according to company reports."
The English translation of "Strom fließt wieder" is "Electricity is flowing again."
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday in the Umspannstation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid has caused significant damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
"Here, extensive cleaning and repair work are necessary."
"Parallel to this, an attachment to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been established."
"With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored."
"Since Saturday at 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again."
"An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 9:30 p.m."
"Since 11:15 p.m., even those who were affected by the power outage have had electricity."
Over 80 mechanics from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"What is important now is that citizens take care of elderly or lonely people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire department if help is needed," said Sebastian Schuster, the district administrator (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
"Setting up and operating emergency power supplies mainly focused on the residents of nursing homes."
"In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those who could not take care of themselves or who required power-dependent medical devices or medical supervision."

To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soap and water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry thoroughly.
Before you bring the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the invisible inside surface of the components or on a yogurt cup.

Originalgetreues Aussehen erreichen die Modelle durch die Decals bzw. Abziehbilder.
From aircraft insignia to ship names to decorative strips and model plates: Decals give the model the final touch.
"Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible."
"A cockpit can be more easily painted before it is installed in the fuselage."
More important than the right tool like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks is having patience and a steady hand when gluing.
"Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them for yourself."
"Decals are also called water transfer pictures because you briefly wet the back of them with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture."
Then you slide the picture a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also pre-moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways off.
Attention: Always check if the image is properly positioned before you completely remove it from the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, knit or even rip.

"Kinderwunschbehandlung bei PKV" can be translated to "Infertility treatment with private health insurance" in English.  "Versicherungsfall" can be translated to "insurance case" or "insurance claim" in English.
Hello everyone.
"We were in fertility treatment for a while, now when it comes to billing with the health insurance, it suddenly puts up a barrier."
In order:
"We applied for the fertility treatment with the PKV in advance and were promised up to 3 attempts."
"The attempts were in no way (such as time frame, success, etc.) limited."
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was covered by the PKV.
"After a while, we tried to have a second child and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet account for the PKV."
"We applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted another three attempts."
After several more attempts (we have conducted more trials than promised, so logically we should deduct the most expensive ones from the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV only wants to compensate for 3 trials.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first promise are forfeited.
"The second child is a new insurance case."
According to AGB, the "insurance case begins with medical treatment and ends when treatment is no longer necessary."
The questions to the experts in this round:
Who has the right of way here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are covered) or us (5 attempts need to be made)?
"Should the PKV have informed us in their promises that the further attempts would be terminated with the birth?"
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could share their opinions.

Topic of the week: The best low-budget films.
"What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits."
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a movie that is filmed with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.

Hello!
"Halber Sieg" against Belarus with high costs for the EU associated.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime.
"But the costs were very high and represented massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus's border with Poland and Lithuania," Bossong told the Evangelical Press Agency (epd).
"Sustainable did not resolve the confrontation, stated the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP)."
"This state of tension - Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels itself as the winner - will probably continue for a while longer."
Bossong believed that the handling of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
"There appears to be a growing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments."
"Since the EU as a whole does not take a determined stance against it, it will be at the expense of fundamental rights."
"This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time."
"She seems unable to push through when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which is not even allowing access to its border for the EU's border protection agency, Frontex."
In addition, the EU pays a price for its border policy with Belarus, according to Bossong: an agreement on asylum policy will be difficult to reach because the "border protection, border protection, border protection" line has been strengthened.
Attempted border crossing
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
"55 migrants were arrested and taken back to the border on Sunday night, according to a spokesperson for the authority on Sunday."
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information provided, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
"Overall, the border security registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours."
"Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border controls."
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months or have tried to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being a dictator in Minsk and luring him with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have reportedly closed border sections.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of people to prevent them from leaving.
"The most effective element of the EU's reaction was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong."
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
"Minsk must also consider internal political costs."
The Belarusian society is not accustomed to the security apparatus regularly processing thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen should have committed two rule violations during the race.
"Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula-1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal."
"Silver arrows suspect two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year."
"A protest refers to a supposed breach by Max Verstappen of Red Bull in the last safety car phase, where he allegedly overtook illegally."
"A second objection was raised against the rating at the end of the race."
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in a rule-compliant manner.
"Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was on his way to his first Formula-1 title."
"The maneuver was performed shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutch driver overtook vehicles in front of him."
"I check it."

Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag.
The Europa Park, namesake of the Europa Park Stadium for the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited Fantag to the SC Freiburg.
"As the park communicated, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day."
"There were also vouchers for drinks and sausages."
"The roller coaster trains lit up in red and white on this day."
"Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The translation of the sentence is: "The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s."
"During the first SC Freiburg Fantag at the Europa-Park, it was demonstrated again how well the partnership fits."
"Radiant fans to see, who enjoy the roller coaster together, confirm it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
"Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€?"

"Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women in the community of Krembz are looking for Christmas trees."
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations with Christmas tree sales.
"Once, a man even drove home alone again because he and his partner could not agree."
He plants about 2000 of them every year.
"The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations."
"That makes the pre-Christmas time always a bit fun, he says."
And what about the coupon?

"After all, I received a defective delivery and paid the full price for it."
"I will also evaluate it accordingly!"
"We do not need to lead discussions here on the better dish, but a certain similarity between the two exists."

"Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic"
"We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now."
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble building a stable WiFi network.
Before, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which almost flawlessly received and sent 50 Mbit.
"The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and also to the DLan module connected to it."
However, at the other DLan module that emits WiFi, no more than 500 come in, but the further I move away from the module with the device, the fewer come in (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber-optic connection on the first floor is even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
"I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set which apparently uses a new technology."
This was slightly better than DLan, but there were also similar large losses here.
"Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost through the power line when using fiber optic?"
Is LAN really the sole solution?
"It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house."
"I am really at my wit's end, which is why I created an account here specifically."
"Therefore, I would be so much more grateful for an answer."
"When it is time to change the savings account"
Who would have thought that there would finally be peace with the bank accounts, only to be disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm their past fee increases with all sorts of tricks from their customers, the overdraft fees for negative interest rates are also falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
"Now she has halved the living allowance and even quartered the daily allowance."
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the corporate division of Postbank - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts, and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
"However, these lower fees now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson on request."
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly negotiated individual agreements with existing customers."
The Commerzbank had already fallen below a limit of 50,000 euros earlier, which still applies, just like at ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB among cost-conscious customers has reduced its free limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks now have a deposit limit of €25,000 or less, according to figures from the online portal Verivox.
Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have won their case against this regulation in first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
"Now, discussions are already taking place in banks as to whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - for the possibility that even the higher authorities may declare negative interest rates in principle to be invalid and many millions of dollars may have to be refunded to bank customers."

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
"But your life resembles a mountain and valley journey."
The Hollywood Reporter magazine in the US has named Jennifer Aniston (52) as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of hard work and discipline.
"An army of assistants, stylists, and trainers is dedicated to taking care of her appearance."
"Immerhin, so Aniston, gönne sie sich einen Chip am Tag (ja, richtig gelesen: einen EINZIGEN Chip aus der Tüte)."  "At least, so Aniston, let her have a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag)."
"That you can still win the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a miracle."
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck and is still looking for the big love.
And has removed the baby wish from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
"Das schmerzte sie." translates to "That hurt her." in English.
The people who asked that don't have any idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.

"Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen must retire."
"Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected."
"Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead."
That's it.
"After a driving error and a slight tire touch, Raikkonen had to retire his Alfa Romeo from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after only half of the race distance."
"Es war sein 349. und letzter Grand Prix, der "Iceman" beendet seine Karriere in der Motorsport-Königsklasse."
"At his departure, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates."
"Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 in a Ferrari."
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole, and reached the podium 103 times. (dpa)
Friedrich Holt won the 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport.
The goal of the bobsledder is to emulate the success of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen, who has 94 victories.
"I have calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
At first, he repelled the attack by Johannes Lochner on Saturday, reducing it by five hundredths, where he moved from third place to first.
Then he adjusted the material setting and drove out of the pit with a 0.30 second advantage on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he beat the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgadener who travels to Stuttgart, Johannes Lochner, ranked fifth this time after coming in second place previously.
"Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in fourth place in the first race and took eighth place."
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
"Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka"
"Laura Nolte won her third seasonal victory in the two-person bob on her home track."
After finishing fourth in the Monobob on the previous day, she raced to victory with pusher Deborah Levi in the German triple victory on Sunday, winning the World Cup.
"Mariama Jamanka, the double bobsled Olympic champion from BRC Thuringia, finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen."
"She recorded not only her Olympic qualification but also her first podium finish this winter."
"The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on third place."
"For me, it was super cool to be on the podium for the first time in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama brought me along."
"I am super happy with the development."
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized, "It's not just about pushing ahead, but there is also a lot to do around here."
"Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free rides, but he said: 'It's going in the right direction.'"
"I already had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now!"
What should I do?
"I haven't received it yet and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally inquired."
"Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it."
And now it was said that he had run away, which made me very angry.
"Look into the chat, it was about the Asare Sitzbank."
"I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)"
Why is the shipping scheduled to start on March 16th?
"Nothing of such a long delivery time is stated on your website."
"Only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear."
"Was taken off by your colleague yesterday."
"Why is this a problem today?"
"I have also sent you pictures of the wrong item that was delivered."
But we still want the module rack even if it's new and unblemished.
"Not cancel the entire order."
"Only today, only this week, only until XY..."
Hello dear wonderful girls and women.
"I have something I want to write and maybe it's the same for one or the other..."
"I am 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - ignoring the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically 1 to 1 my child."
"My friend (who I've been friends with since 6th grade) is sick. He burned himself second-degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy)."
"Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot and it was nice."
"I helped him take a shower (because his hand was in a cast due to burns)."
He is aloof and we see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week), which makes it difficult for me to fulfill my needs for affection and love.
"My dog is currently feeling sick, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his bed and has relaxed a bit after I turned on the heating pad and petted him."
"I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for just one month."
"Now, homework also comes to us, which we will naturally divide among ourselves."
"But even cooking is a lot of work for me..."
"My PTBS illness is currently well established, I am halfway well treated and making progress."
"Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom-free."
"My university is demanding a lot from me right now. I have a written test tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. that I haven't prepared for yet, and I have an anatomy class the day after that I should at least have a basic understanding of."
"Next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is already in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space."
"My week is also like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend."
But what about after that?
"Only until birthday."
"Only until the start of the holidays."
"Only until the weekend."
"Only until..."
And so it goes on forever.
"I believe I am just so stressed that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I would lose it."
"I somehow feel guilty and chaotic, but I can't do it any other way..."
Does the same thing happen to you too?
"Ehrlich, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work."
"Really inexpressibly grateful, I can't even put it into words."
"We don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise."
"I believe it also has something to do with the mental load that women have and that's why I thought I would certainly find fellow sufferers here..."
"I wish you at least a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!"
"I received my order today but unfortunately it's a different color and the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print."
"During the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website."
"We are very disappointed!!!"
What can you offer me?
"If we swap the table now, will I get a different color or something?"
"The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#."
In any case, twice.
"Confirmed but not confirmed."
Mal was komplett anderes: Ich habe damals in der Schule festgestellt, dass viele Religionslehrer nicht an Gott glauben und es für sie nur ein weiteres Fach ist, wie Mathe oder Erdkunde.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed it.
"How do you stand on that?"
Maybe you can also tell me about your work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional matters and it is appropriate to keep them separate.
"There is also a curriculum, etc."
"But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity."
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't even believe in it themselves?
"Culture preserve or something?"
"I hope this question is not too personal."
Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand it well.
"That is already very long, then I would look away."
"That's good, thank you."
"I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week."
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
"Film search help please."
Hello dear people.
"I am looking for a movie from my childhood (age 24)."
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
"In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds)."
"Zum einen die Moderne (reale Welt)" can be translated to "Modernity (real world)" in English.
"On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure)."
"Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman."
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
"For some reason, paths cross and something happens."
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
"If this tells you something, I am grateful for any answer."
"Our little one has only slept on her stomach from week 1."
The English translation of "Fast forward: lebt noch :D" is "Fast forward: still alive :D."
"Relax."
"So a child can hold out much more than one thinks."
Make sure everything is in order around here, no soft toys, go in and take a look from time to time, but no minute-by-minute surveillance.
"That makes you crazy!"
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
"No pillows."
"Achso and we had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket."
"Observe your child when it sleeps."
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can something be erected from the ground up?
Does the face lie directly on the mattress?
You can deduce from this whether everything is in order.
"We have all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was customary to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep."
"Furthermore, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already purchased many items."
"But why are you only offering me 20EUR then?"
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and haven't received any feedback yet.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
"Please contact me as soon as possible."
"The cabinet is currently not usable."
To say it clearly and plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
Yes, I know myself that not everything can be held on to.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
"It is simply the case that the politics of this station is now under the control of all sorts of pigs."
"Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then immediately go on a big begging tour."
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.

The removable cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or the oven.
"The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well."
"The Kirschkern-Kissen with reference is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications: "
Before warming the nipple on an unusual smell, check for stock or burn marks and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion to warm it up before use!
"In the microwave at a maximum power of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions!)"
"After heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!"
"Afterwards, place the cushion inside the cover."
"During the initial warm-up, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears with repeated use."
"Please adhere to the specified heating instructions as prolonged periods or higher power levels may result in damage (risk of combustion and burning)!"
"Check before heating a kiss in the microwave that the heating of grain products is allowed in the user manual of the manufacturer."
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion on your arm for suitability for babies (maximum 43°C)!
"Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hemorrhages, blood issuing and open wounds, as well as for individuals with decreased pain sensitivity."
Please consult a doctor if you have any existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor conditions, or are pregnant before using this product.
"If seams have opened and filler has come out, dispose of the product and the filler immediately and inaccessible to children."

Is the battery dead?
"Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) would no longer charge through its charger."
"I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work."
"I thought a power supply alone is enough for operation."
"Error indication, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start anymore even with the charger plugged in."
"Therefore, I have taken out the battery, but nothing happens even here."
Do you have any ideas?
"A new battery has been ordered, but why can I not use my laptop in online mode?"
Is there anything else broken?
"Thank you for your help!"
"I would like to have the delivery of #PRS\_ORG# brought to my room."
"How can I buy the book?"
"I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair."
"But we don't know how high the seat is..."
Oft on tour and yet still have a lot of equipment with you?
"With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!"
The 20-liter capacity can accommodate larger photo equipment without any issues, which can be safely stored in the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
"With the 'Update' of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look."
"The sleek, minimalist design has it in for a figure of speech - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds."
"This works with two options: conventionally through the lid closure, which can be secured with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "In the closure cap, there is a metal closure hook with appropriate anchor brackets on the front side of the backpack."
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has come up with several "fill levels": there are indeed 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be snapped.
"Is the backpack full loaded, you just take the top board, if it's rather empty, you take a deeper one."
"Klappenverschluss und Haken sind außerdem magnetisch."
"Therefore, the backpack can also be reliably closed without inserting the hook."
The second possibility distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photography backpacks in a fundamental way: in addition to the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
"This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!"
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday practicality of the backpack: If you not only take your photography equipment but also everyday items or travel gear with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior space (more details below) and easily separate and store both of them separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to in front of your body, for example, to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items remain safe in the left backpack compartment and do not get in the way.
"Comfortable and easily adjustable shoulder straps help with that."
And the outer shell of the backpack is also made up of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, so even if it's going to Scotland in the fall, the contents will stay dry.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for an email from their support.
"NAME" sent me an email of confirmation for the assignment yesterday.
"Contact has been made by the forwarder for the pickup of the wrongly delivered table announced."
"I haven't received any message yet."
"I request immediate resolution."
"I am now writing with my third support staff member, with none of them I got further than a promise that I would receive an email as confirmation."
It is about sending back the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#.
"It is then to be expected when the wardrobe can be delivered again?"
"To keep him like that is not an option for me..."
It works.
"Many many thanks for the help"
"Wünsche Ihnen noch einen schönen Abend" can be translated to "I wish you a nice evening" in English.
"Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?"
Translation: Order and payment were made on January 12, 2021.
"I received a completely different lamp than the one I ordered."
Please call me.
"If you extend the coupon to me, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it."

"Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast."
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining pieces of debris in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
"Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country."
"Boundaries were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight."
"Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth."
"Coloma or Bust" 的英文翻译为 "Coloma or bankruptcy!"。
"In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the west and wants to make a name for yourself."
You will seek gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and establish businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river valleys and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have had the same idea!
"You must outperform your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them."
"Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory."
"You choose your actions simultaneously, need to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building")."
The buildings on your board allow you to be more efficient, obtain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune your individual playing style by making adjustments.
"Coloma spielt über einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren von 1848 (das Jahr, in dem das Gold in Coloma entdeckt wurde), über 1849 (das Jahr des California Gold Rush) bis 1850 (das Jahr, in dem Kalifornien die offizielle Staatlichkeit erlangte)."
"A year in Coloma consists of five rounds."
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pawns on the appropriate locations.
"If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lockdown!"
"This deactivates one half of the location, reducing the possible actions there."
Then the players take turns leading actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes.
"When all actions are completed, the pioneers return."
The translator rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions.
"This will continue until the watering can moves five times, so that each position is covered once and the year ends."
"There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits."

"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek.
The English translation of this sentence is: "CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, and misuse of power."
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have looked at it right away.
Children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
"With his book 'Why Our Children Become Tyrants' (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on education."
Former patients and their guardians now make serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is difficult to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It should never, never, never be allowed to parents and other responsible parties to have power over the child.
Our goal should always be to give the child space for their development and to create a framework for the child that is as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
"Brrr, I am still shivering."
Holetschek: Countries advised on the elimination of the test requirement for triple vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the states plan to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals on their next meeting.
"We need clarity quickly as to whether and when three-time vaccinated individuals can be exempt from testing," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, in an interview with "Bild am Sonntag".
Holetschek stated that the absence of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional immunization stimulus."
Bundes Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the health ministers' conference already on Tuesday next week.

What you are describing is referred to as *Awareness* under general anesthesia.
"These occur with an frequency of approximately 1 to 1000."
Most often, it leads to hearing sounds/voices, rarely seeing images, and almost never experiencing pain.
"Relevant for this topic: Kaiserschnitte are operations that occur with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until the child is discharged from the hospital."
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia preoperative evaluation.
"Specific anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk."
"EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but Nitemarex had no Awareness by definition."
"I have misread her comment."

"Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement."
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to IRNA news agency on Sunday.
"This is a 'positive and important development' because there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated at the outset."
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, negotiations in Vienna for the renewal of the agreement had resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
At the negotiations, Iranian negotiators, those of Germany, the UK, China, France, and Russia will participate.
"Even a US delegation is on site in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations."
"Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now a federal state with highest Corona incidence."
"Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide."
"As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000."
As the only federal state, Thuringia has remained above the 1000 mark in COVID-19 incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 residents.
"In Saxony, which has always boasted the highest incidence rate in the country, the rate on Sunday was 990.5."
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but it had also remained above the value of 1000.
"In Thuringia, 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported within a day."
"200 patients with severe Covid-19 illness were intensively treated in hospitals on Sunday."
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
"Furthermore, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are barely keeping up with the registration of new cases."
"I understand that."

"The Bundestag greeted me, I am [StratorDE] in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on an amazing day!"
What is the purpose of this post?
"If one looks at the activity of the Bundestag in the past months, one can conclude that it does not exist."
"We have come into a winter stupor and have extended the summer hole for several months."
Where is the problem?
"Yes, what did it depend on?"
"To a large extent, it is likely that this is simply due to dissatisfaction with the way some things have turned out and our overall situation."
"In recent days, it has become evident that many here are genuinely interested in the German Bundestag."
"What we need to change."
At this point, the community around the German Bundestag is being asked which it wants to keep alive.
The inspiration came from u/edizVEVO, who has recently paid attention to this project and found, to put it simply, a mess of shards.
"After some back and forth editing, several people from the community have been found who are willing to rebuild the project."
"However, I once again expressly call on all to participate, only in this way can this project also exist in the future."
"We have established a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work on specific things together."
"You can join the server by clicking on this link."
Goals:
How is the Bundestag going to function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How can new members be recruited?
"How do we create a fair electoral system?"
"I am pretty sure that I forgot something, but it's not bad, and we have the Discord at the end."
"If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together, and let's democratically decide on the future."
"I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still to be delivered."

"Very sad about it."

This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.

"I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the shelf as much as possible for pickup. They should contact #PRS_ORG# to determine how this can work."
"You can contact me at any time to arrange a pickup date and time."
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long do I have to take care of these or decide on the return?
"How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?"
"I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like today."
"She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently probably eats meat very rarely."
"I myself was a vegetarian for several years before that."
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And indeed, I have long thought that being a vegetarian would support animal welfare, but I eventually reflected and understood that in doing so, I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
"Therefore, my decision to become vegan."
At that moment, I had the impression that annoyance arose on their side, and then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
"Feeling like you are quickly pushed into a corner as a vegan and conflicts arise that you didn't intend to happen."
"A harmonious-loving vegan greets"
It is not a clear case of an exception under § 312d BGB.
"Your #PRS\_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling."

Could you please assign me an alternative pickup time?
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again.
"Lahnsteiner Wehr is equipped for water rescue: €45,000 subsidy from the land."
Recently, Roger Lewentz, the interior minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, presented a check for 45,000 euros to Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein, in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department of Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle that has been in service since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
"A good and important investment in security."
"I am glad that the state of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
"They fulfill tasks both above and below water in water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance."
In Lahnstein, permanent with increasing costs: The boom of the hotel shipping on Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
"I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started."

"Thank you first for standing up for this matter, I also spent almost a decade in a similar role in the state service, so to speak, we were also weapon carriers in the executive, let's not dwell on it any further!"
"The question of right and left I always find to be very simplistically presented."
Generally speaking, one should say that the civil servant tends to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people dressed in uniforms and carrying weapons can be attractive to those on the right who are conservative and magical, and it should also be clear that these people will have difficulty dealing with the lived reality. Of course, besides the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché queens, because there are fewer of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you), and I must rely on these people as well, because in the end, they may save your life or set it up
"But even these fringe groups, despite sounding funny at first, hold a conservative stance in my opinion, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less pulled away by exaggerated left-wing policies, even though these policies supposedly support them or are meant to make things right for them, they just want to be treated normally."
"Back to the rights, of course, the police and military are also a cross-section of society. Naturally, one will find extreme rights there, but they should not be allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly hatch any state-threatening plans there. This is completely exaggerated in the media and also bothers me."
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who are often deployed abroad may start to stereotype and even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that certain right-wing acquaintances meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it is well combated in my opinion and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
"Germany is so extremely internationally entangled, and that's actually good in my opinion, because we couldn't afford to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks."
"Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side."
"Why should this come from England?"
"When I ordered, it was not sold out."
"I have already ordered in November."
"It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order."
"It is still about my order, which is no longer available."
"I have previously chatted with #NAME#."
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black could be delivered to Germany or is this basket available in Germany as well.
"I always find only you as a partner company."
"But above the edge of the wooden part are two deep grooves that are filled with something yellow."
"And on the mirror itself is a small scratch."
"Ordentlicher durch Kind?" doesn't have a direct translation in English. It is a German phrase that roughly means "Can you go through a child?" or "Can you go around a child?" However, it is not a commonly used phrase in English.
"Hello, I (w32) have been occupied with this matter for some time."
"I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, have very little leisure time), but I have always had difficulty keeping my household clean and organized for an extended period of time."
There are always phases when everything stays the same, and then every now and then it hits me and I clean up and tidy up.
"But it is actually never like "someone might drop in for a visit spontaneously."
"My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere but he usually loses the household to work and bad mood."
"The kitchen is cleaned on a regular basis because we enjoy cooking."
"Now to my question, have you managed to become a decent person?"
"We don't have it yet, but we are working on it, and this question has been occupying me for a longer time."
For me, I don't have any motivation, it simply doesn't bother me that much as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide a greater motivation or does one remain careless?
"Looking forward to your answers."
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality and anatomically formed cut provides maximum comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
"I have undergone training in the field of software development and have been working as a software developer for about a year now."
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering restarting my studies and pursuing a degree in social work.
The problem: I have a self-defeating (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
"That means, roughly speaking, that I don't have self-esteem and am therefore shy."
"I have no problem talking on a factual level with people, but it's very difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I've been told that I come across as unapproachable (which I believe I've improved on)."
Can I become a social worker?
"I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support."
"But I don't know if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it online."
The AVPS is already causing problems for me in my job (emotionally), because it always brings me down when it finds something to criticize in my code ("again, just simple things messed up") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it by now"/"I'm holding him back with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).
"I will probably have these problems in any job, but I should have mentioned it here."
Did you already get the sofa back?
"There was no confirmation for that."
"I am waiting for a pickup appointment."
What do you mean by "please give back"?
"If I download a book to the #PRS\_ORG#, the message comes Your #PRS\_ORG# does not authorize this book."
Is there a problem there?
"I was chatting with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet."

Following this modest gift of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).
Provide the English translation for the following sentence: "1 g NEKTON-Bio auf 250 ml Wasser oder 100 g Weichfutter."  "1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food."
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
"A crossed-out spoon (indicated) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio."
"In the case of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be administered at the beginning, until the approach to feather regrowth is visible."
"After that, a normal dose will be administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed."
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry and without exposure to sunlight, at a temperature between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.

Statement of a community member in conflict with the bylaws.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman!
"I have the following problem."
"A walnut tree is to be felled on our property."
The English translation of "Also Fällantrag an die Gemeinde gestellt." is "Also submitted a petition to the community."
"An employee writes to me that falling of fruit trees and thus walnuts are not included in the regulations."
"However, the walnut tree is explicitly designated as a protected tree in the regulation."
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
"On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert's opinion."
"On the other hand, the statute is clear."
"Thank you for your answers."
"We understand that."
"Then we will use the new packaging for that."
"I haven't received any message."
"Well, I still have a sofa without use."
"Could you offer me a discount or a remainder?"
What was more expensive?
"Yes, I believe that. The only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling shipped to Germany."
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident in Selb.
Recently, a severe traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg.
"As the current police press alarm announces (14:03 hours), a car has come into the oncoming lane while overtaking."
There are injured people.
"Ah, I understand."
"Thanks again for it being so easy!"
"Rat und Ideen zu weiterem Berufsleben" can be translated to "Rat and ideas for further professional life" in English.
Firstly, happy Christmas to you!
"My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently denying everything that can be denied."
"Before I dive in ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - that's you guys."
"Ich mache gerade das Ref als Quereinsteiger." 的英语翻译是 "I'm currently doing the Ref as a lateral entrant."
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field related to it (to remain somewhat anonymous, I won't be more specific).
The whole thing was then too boring to me, and I looked for alternatives that could bring me more fun.
"I eventually ended up in teaching and I was sure that it was it - even though the conditions were clearly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me."
"I am now at the third 'I Google other job postings'."
"And it's only been half a year."
"Before starting to paint, I always decided to continue and at least finish the sketch, and then I could still make a turn."
"But I am absolutely finished."
"I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted."
"Although it is vacation now, there is still a lot of work waiting for me."
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but even my weekends and my days off were also my days off.
"At that time, I was free."
"And the stress at work was momentary."
"Now the family celebration is too much stress for me."
And then there are these rigid structures that bother me even more.
Generally, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is also running well, as far as feedback is concerned.
"But I am completely exhausted and I am wondering how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so."
I ask myself whether I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you - or whether I should not go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take free time when I needed it, and although the work was somehow boring, it was adequately paid and we worked together as a team to achieve something, rather than being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place a year from now and be just as dissatisfied as I am now.
You notice that everything is somehow mixed up, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider that can help me get out of this situation where I am completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
"Decisions will not be made emotionally right now, which is likely to lead to nothing good."
"But perhaps your opinions will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now."
"Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me."
"I hope my situation is at least somewhat clear now."
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, resulting in the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
"With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound."
"Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive."
"These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, of course."
This partly relies on genuine analog circuits because these get the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier's sound better than any simulation.
In addition to this elaborate circuit design, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
"With the 'Tone Room' software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined."
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
"Of course, it has since been refined multiple times to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous, significantly improved amplifier models."
The Valvetronix VT+ series has been designed with a range of models from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response.
During a thorough analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Trotz 20 Punkte von Wagner, Magic verlieren bei Clippers.
"The losing streak series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues."
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also versatile: with three individually placeable and foldable dividers, it adapts perfectly to your photo equipment and is thus suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits into a backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and lens.
A possible equipment setup would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens attached and two to three interchangeable lenses, as well as a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras, such as various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2, still leave room for additional lenses.
"Additionally, you can store plenty of accessories."
"And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things related to photography."
"Even drone pilots find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including remote control and accessories."
"Volcanic eruption on La Palma: likely the longest in history."
"In the little over three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage."
Is an end in sight?
"With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island."
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 had been considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the West Coast of Africa, lasting for 84 days.
"There are no reliable data available on previous eruptions."
The activity of the yet unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists are still hesitant to make a prediction as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a deceleration.
"The best news is that they are stable," said President Mariano Hernández Zapata of the Island Council, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
"Damages in the millions"
"In the little over three months since the outbreak, the over 1000 degree Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE."
"1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer."
This translates to almost 1700 soccer fields.
"More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros."
"Before the coast, formed by cooled lava, two new peninsulas with a total area of about 50 hectares have emerged."
"Heavily affected in particular was the banana cultivation, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly rely on and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption."
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas were severely affected.
"Christmas and gifts"
"Christmas is just around the corner and the children are eagerly awaiting the heavenly festival."
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something irresistible about them, connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
"So much more important it is to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples" that has broken free from rigid routine and can be filled with life in the context of this tradition."
"How Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child."
"Streng genommen waren es die Protestanten, durch welche die Weihnachtstage eng mit dem Beschenken verknüpft wurden." 的英文翻译是："In fact, it was the Protestants who closely linked Christmas days with gift-giving."
Before Christmas Day, gifts were exchanged in some form or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold coins into the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular custom in Germany of filling children's shoes with gifts originated.
Protestants rejected this custom because they reject the idea of intermediaries as "holy reverence."
"They guard against the institution for these reasons."
Martin Luther transformed St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby established a new tradition.
"The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas."
Since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions so closely, it only aggravates the fewest that the tradition of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas tradition with Martin songs and Martin processions, remains a firm part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, one can find boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to desired luxury watches, everything that the heart desires.
"Diversity of traditions in Christian countries"
"Sources confirm a tradition of gift-giving dating back to the 13th century on the feast day of Saint Nicholas."
"With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas."
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful hubbub about the question of who will now bring gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is essentially a type of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
"This includes, for example, his white beard that has only little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to houses."
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought fame to some extent.
Here are three horses pulling his sleigh, instead of renters.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering gifts.

"Police shoot dead suspected bank robber near the palace."
"Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday."
The police reported that callers had reported a man with a gun entering a bank and a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by the police shortly afterwards.
"Shots had been fired and the man had been hit."
He was declared dead at the scene of the crime.
"The police did not assume a terrorist background."
"There are several embassies situated around the Kensington Palace."
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any garden, garden area, or rock garden.
"The lamp can be simply set up and anchored to the ground with 2 earth spikes."
"Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in batteries."
Maximum duration of 10 days.
The durable plastic casing can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that emit colorful light from within.
"Smart Stone" is completely harmless: it is the sun that makes this solar lamp fascinating, shining in either white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The unframed, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
"His organic rounded shapes fit in any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden."
He also makes himself big in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save on big preparations: "Smart Stone" does not require electrical wiring or batteries as a solar lamp.
"Set the 'lightstone' at any place that is illuminated by the sun during the day."
"Two provided earth spikes ensure stable support when needed."
The white plastic cover is both robust and weatherproof.
"Its solar module conceals 'Smart Stone' discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light."
"The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing."
"As dusk falls, 'Smart Stone' begins to light up automatically; choose any of the six attractive light colors for yourself: in addition to daylight white, there are six colors to choose from."
"Finally, the shutdown occurs automatically when the battery level drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets dark again."
"As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning the next day."
"I have done that several times, but it doesn't work."

Ref: Lesson planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues.
"I have been in the referee's room since summer, teaching is fun, but I currently have big time-efficient problems planning my geography lesson."
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well-equipped, so in principle, I can only use the blackboard, textbook, and an OHP as my medium.
"In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography)."
"I currently need to plan my hours very long."
"For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geographic factors, and with me, every hour stands on its own."
In principle, methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I also don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need this time for UBs, etc.).
"I usually start planning by considering what I want to achieve (my learning goal) and then think about how I can build it up (usually, I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have)."
"We are dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book Terra, and with the book itself."
"Therefore also the worksheets."
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book efficiently.
"Would really make me happy."
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER# .
"I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to return the old one as soon as possible."
"The trade fears due to the 2G regulation for the Christmas business."
"In most businesses, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed."
"The trade considers this unnecessary and regrets revenue losses."
"A possible solution he also has ready."
"The 2G regulations harm the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE)."
"Regarding articles of infrequent demand, we are experiencing sales breaks to lament, criticized the CEO of HDE, Stefan Genth."
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, over 70% of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
"Many would have already written off Christmas business."
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year, is now often a hole without a bottom," said Genth.
"Dealers with 2G access restrictions therefore lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week."
Does it only run in the grocery retail sector and online?
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The translation of the sentence is: "The shopping with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO."
"2G does not help us in our fight against the pandemic when shopping," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared customers away and required significant human resource investment.
He called for the bandage regulation to be approved nationwide.
"After that, each customer should only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would be able to access all businesses with the band received on that day."
"In addition, in retail - as in the case of the 3G rule in public transportation (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - spot checks should be sufficient."
Even the specialist real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which focuses on shopping centers, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies recently lay at around 75% of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the revenues were around 90%.
"These numbers will surely fall right in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of Wirtschaftswoche.
"Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, the centers are attempting to find solutions and obtain approval."
"The so-called band solution, where visitors, for example, can prove their 2G once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with an armband like in a club hotel, can enter all the shops unobstructed." (dpa)
"I recently ordered the #PRS\_ORG# and received it."
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake at the frame, which is attempting to be covered up with a yellow filler.
"That looks ugly."
"I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it and resealed the package."
"How should I proceed with the return now?"
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
"For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides extraordinary capabilities."
"Besides adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light."
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K and save it.
"Use the current settings in the flash memory."
"A special feature of the Controller is its simplicity and intuitive operability."
"The lamp generates a very bright light current with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker."
The angle of radiation of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in inaccessible places.
"At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display."
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
"There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)."
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To store the settings for each setting on the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the save buttons for a longer period of time and you're done.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that the same situation is restored when it is turned on again - very practical in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
"Working with battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, resulting from the possibility of operating with cost-effective NP-F batteries."
"These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment."
"The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power before setting up - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery bays, a value is displayed in the two display screens (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display)."
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlight with the included power adapter.
"The setup of the headlight is very simple."
"You have a 16mm housing for attachment, which allows you to attach it directly to your tripod."
"The inclination can be reliably established by measuring at both sides."
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and therefore designed for durability and hard usage.
"In addition, a swivel joint is included in the delivery scope."
"Impressive is that a bag is also included in the delivery."
"Therefore, you can transport or store the lamp along with any accessories you may want to buy safely without any issues."
"Shame, I received it as a gift and it's too small :("

But then SGE turned it on, vented their frustration over a patchy start to the season in just one hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," exclaimed coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to every single one who was involved."
At the beginning, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who were still on ninth place despite their improved performance.
"Patrik Schick had led Bayer Leverkusen into a 2-0 lead."
What happened then even impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
"I am crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result."
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game day and overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and especially enjoyed the result for the audience.
"That was the party that we wanted to throw today."
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he feels well-positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in top physical condition.
"It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally."
"Let's continue to progress step by step and remain humble." And let's complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level."
Next up on Wednesday as part of the English week is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30 hours, Sky).
"I will receive an email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part."
"I have tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and redirect it, no chance."
"Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is canceled?"
"Unfortunately, it would mean for me that I won't be able to order again because it has already taken a very long time."
"Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?"
"Dampers for the women's handball team before the quarterfinals against Spain."
"Germany's women's handball team slinked off the court with drooping heads and empty stares after being humiliated by Denmark."
At the end of the main round of the WM, the German national team suffered a bitter defeat against Spain with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now have to face the hosts in the quarterfinals.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
"Against Spain, we must present ourselves differently."
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danish team (10:0).
It is unfortunate that we could not bring the Flow with us.
"That was a bad game that we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
"In the battle for a spot in the semifinals, a significant improvement is required against the 2019 World runner-up on Tuesday to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007."
Best German thrower in the match against three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels in the backcourt with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in defense," midfielder Xenia Smits admitted and demanded, "We need to look forward quickly now."
"Not on top from front to back"
"Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top of their game at the start of the match."
"Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and defensive gaps were responsible for a quick 0:4 disadvantage after seven minutes."
"Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on duty and prevented worse with some saves."
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counter-attack.
"However, this was not the expected initial spark."
"Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women had difficulty making an impact - and when they did, they often failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women."
"So the game was called early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since Mia Zschocke, the back player, saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent."
"But she can participate again in the quarterfinals."
"First, in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection played slightly better and at least scored five goals before the break."
The already faint hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
"The Green-Schützlingen sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a medal candidate in the final."
"As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and left the playing field as a clear loser."

The title exists, I am a traveling vaccine doctor, where (currently only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
"As these will soon be largely completed, it will proceed partly in vaccine centers for me."
I'd be happy to answer questions about organizational and human aspects and medical questions, as long as they are not time-limited (e.g., "I'd be happy to answer questions about organizational and human aspects and medical questions, as long as they are not time-limited (e.g., "I'd be happy to answer questions about organizational and human aspects and medical questions, as long as they are not time-limited (e.g., "I'd be happy to answer questions about organizational and human aspects and medical questions, as long as they are not time-limited (e.g., "I'd be happy to answer questions about organizational and human aspects and medical questions,
"In my area of responsibility falls the education on vaccination, the indication for vaccination (the person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons that speak against it), medical documentation, and possibly emergency treatment in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me)."
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, such as medical staff.
In Impfteams do we often have no choice but to rely on "only" pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are unable to perform vaccinations (allowed to?), so I also perform the majority of vaccinations myself.
"Schwere 'Huidlerer'-Frage: Amberger weiß die Lösung" can be translated to "Difficult 'Huidlerer' question: Amberger knows the solution."
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word sent by an Amberger, a heated debate has been sparked in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern."
However, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "nervous person."
And no one, "who everything has to go fast for".
"Das, heard by the people from the TV moderator, is completely wrong."
"On what the man from Amberg announced as the solution and thus also caused surprise among many Upper Palatines."
"The cleaner," the audience learned, "is a rag used to wipe the stove clean."
"Linguist Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this."
"With the annotation that this is a typically Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the more familiar regional dialect word "Houdern.""
"With what a gap in education was closed - perhaps even for those who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time."
"I can't buy books for the past 2 weeks."
The following is the English translation of the given sentence:  "After confirmation, the following error message always appears: 'oops - something went wrong - try again later.'"
"I have connected the #PRS\_ORG# to the PC, restarted it, synchronized it, and repaired it."
"Nothing has helped."
"Tire choice for racing bikes- really so pancake safe?"
This morning, I woke up with a strong urge to do something, because I wanted to prepare for my bicycle tour next week by at least doing some training.
Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday, away.
"The first 40km were really nice - but then what usually happens in every city (this time, thank you Krefeld!) happened."
The English translation of "Glassplitter auf der Strecke." is "Glassplitter on the track."
"Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the journey at all."
Since I had no real opportunity to purchase a replacement coat and tire due to the day of the week, I had to turn around halfway and take the first available train back home with a somewhat bad mood.
"Then it wouldn't be so bad from a laundry perspective, maybe it's even better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour."
"But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me."
Given that I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would much rather not encounter this problem frequently.
"It wasn't really that bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had come to pick up the bike the day I got it and had ridden 120km on them until 14:00!) were also quite old and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for many years."
"But if I think about the fact that I have to change a tire at 80-90 km/h, then I am really in a bad mood, I think."
"Now I am in conversation with an older man at the train station, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unplatable."
"Now it all sounds very tempting."
But are they really that indestructible?
"I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end."
I continue to wonder: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
"There is also (apparently) at the Marathon Plus tires, but most of it is already wider."
Is this a problem?
"Would you generally recommend me other tires for a racing bike?"
"Die Schwalbe-Seite seems to be my absolute favorite! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?"
Thank you in advance for the help and love!
"Car crashes into tree: driver fatally injured"
The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for an unknown reason and collided with a central reservation before veering onto the opposite lane, as reported by the police.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have offspring.
"SOLO 15 refers to the new offspring and visually reminds one of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM."
However, this building proposal includes a foot that is appropriately designed to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
"This has no effect on acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home."
"Principally suitable for individuals where the maximum sound level is of relatively minor importance, but an unusually high sound quality is to be achieved."
"A 10 cm speaker is simply unable to generate nearly unfiltered sound pressure levels of that magnitude."
That does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she makes an impressive debut and for her size, she is extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in pitch.
This is generally done with broadband to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
"Exactly tailored to the listening room, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound."
"Leicht nach außen gedreht kann der Hochtonbereich reduziert und so das Klangbild wärmer gestaltet werden."
"Thanks to the point source, the localization of individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and dazzlingly precise."
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of B 100 - 6 OHM result in a friendliness that seeks its equal.
"The SOLO 15 enhances not only our SOLO series, but also expands its capabilities in terms of resolving power and accuracy."
"At the beginning of all our construction projects, it is recommended to think about the final optics of the loudspeaker in order to plan for any necessary changes during construction."
"For example, if you want to panel the housing, you must adjust the lowering of the speaker accordingly, as the veneer adds another layer of material."
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate location to be able to easily pass the cable through later.
"With the help of a tweeter, a speaker opening in the front is now present, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed neatly later."
"The rear opening should be angled at 45 degrees to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis interior."
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted during the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
Next, one begins the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of them.
"Now, the back wall, lid, front, and bottom will be assembled."
"Dabei sollten auch die drei Versteifungen eingesetzt und verklebt werden."
"The reinforcements themselves can vary in material strength as needed, for example, by using pre-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16mm MDF."
"In the next step, the second side will be attached."
"After that, all the plates of the foot follow, including both sides and the front."
"By using a suitable hole saw or a forestner bit, the installation of the bass reflex vent holes and the mounting clamp on the back wall is facilitated."
Next, one uses a round file to round off all the edges of the actual box.
"Even the upper surface of the footplate can be rounded off."
"In the following step, the footplate is firmly bonded to the foot of the housing and additionally secured with long wooden screws."
"It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5mm drill bit) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal."
After the housing has been cleaned of wooden dust (absorbed / blown off), work begins on laying the cable.
"This can be achieved most simply through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "While pushing the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal opening, and leaving it about 30 cm out of the opening."
"In the upper part of the casing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is left loosely hanging out there."
Next, the frequency changer will be prepared and used.
The plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation guide for the Weiche Solo 15.
Is the frequency switch installed and the terminal connector secured, followed by the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet fully closed.
"Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of skill, one can drop hot glue onto the opening and close it off."
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
"Now follows the damping according to the description."
"Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws."
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely placed in the housing.
"The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear."
"Can I cancel the order now and deliver it in early June?"
Hello to everyone.
Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to invite more than four people into the studio due to certain reasons, which increases the planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
"ABER: At least three people will be present at the switch, so that we can watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully with thousands of you!"
"We do our best to avoid delays or other problems."
But hey, it's still pandemic - nonetheless, we'll give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible to accompany.
It will start around 0:30.
"Prepare cold drinks, plan good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night."
