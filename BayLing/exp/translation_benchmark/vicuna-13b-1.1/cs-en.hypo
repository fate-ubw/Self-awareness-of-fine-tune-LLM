According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbatov a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked on the assumption that the accused former vice president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns by Slavia Prague for winning the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The English translation for the sentence is: "He informed the server efotbal.cz that he had access to the police records."
The chairman of the management board of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red-white team did not engage in any corrupt conduct.
"The server published a transcript of police interviews, in which Slavia figures mainly as its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who resigned from the top club in the summer."
"A former influential functionary of the red-white party was, according to the file, in frequent contact, both with Berbr, as well as with the former sports director of then second-league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case."
Criminalists reportedly worked on the information that Slavia Berbrovi allegedly promised a financial reward for getting the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police organization was aware that Roman (Berbr) was supposed to receive a million-dollar bribe from Slavia Prague football club officials for winning the league, according to a server.
According to criminalists, Berbr later turned out not only with Nezmar but also with the chairman of Slavia's board of directors, Tvrdík.
"It does not follow from the report that the police are still dealing with this information."
"He rejected any corrupt actions."
"Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative development path to its opponents."
"We have never tolerated any unlawful behavior, we have not attempted to influence referees in violation of the fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial compensation in this context to anyone," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In retaliation, among other things, Nezmar unceremoniously insults some former players of Slavia, and also maligns his former boss Tvrdík.
"Kauza údajného ovlivňování zápasů prostřednictvím rozhodčích rozpoutala dříve v polovině října policejní zásah na několika místech včetně pražského sídla FAČR."
The highest-placed person in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any football functions.
In the middle of January, Rogoz, the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody just like [name].

The first deliveries of molnupiravir to Czechia indeed highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of useful tools in the fight against coronavirus pandemics but also the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As was said, the first to be administered molnupiravir to Czech patients will be from the Merck company.
The company ended up on the grass as the first one and because the drug was being developed for a long time before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral equine diseases in South America.

A young woman died in a car accident on Prachatice.

The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.

He mainly collects sports cards.
"Usually, they can be dozens of dollars, say around ten dollars, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where the postage is often free," the collector approximates.
From October, the ordering of small consignments became slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and provide data for customs management to the post office.
"He will receive an email with a message that the customs are expecting the arrival of a package."
"It is enough to fill in the information about the consignment, and if DPH did not include the trader in the sale, the customs office will calculate the customs duty from the total amount for the consignment and for transportation."
"In case the addressee does not ensure customs clearance by themselves, they must also pay a fee to the carrier."
According to Luke Neuheisel, but the entire process is not complicated.

The case is being handled by the Czech Republic.

"However, in the decree it stands that there is no other god but Jahveh."

"Are we learning to see things from the other side?"
Everywhere we hear about how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to struggle, and how they died.
"I have never heard of teaching from the perspective of the slave-owner or from that time, no one defends it, they only condemn it."
No one will tell you in schools that black people often sold themselves into slavery, and that they were often the worst slave traders.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they will only tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, exterminated them, at the same time killing each other for centuries.
"For a while, I also spent time in the USA, directly at schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones."
I don't agree with the idea that someone would deliberately conceal facts, but I have heard before that it happens and to me it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan war atrocities are quite taboo).
My points were that history is not black and white and that we tend to view it from today's perspective without understanding.
"Historii nezajímají něčí pocity, je prostě jaká je and I think it is fatal to judge something without considering the context of the time."
"On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again."

"In addition, Sever was not much better, as many people today idealize him."
"A lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and many things also worked against them."
"You can't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, and what's more, our perspective doesn't even exist (there was a video on YouTube from television where someone started talking about our legionnaires and 1968)."
"What came to US schools as silly was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country never experienced."
Overall, I got the impression that some universities were shocking, the students were too radicalized, and those schools supported them to that extent.
"And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it's a bit uncomfortable for me that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are also many young people and even in the ruling elite."
"I think that feminism has already achieved what it set out to achieve and has already changed. It has become radicalized."
In the present, those who are labeled as feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, just like other groups such as LGBT. This leads to radicalization on both sides, where it often leads to resistance from even reasonable things.
"Moreover, the more someone is radical, the more you can hear them."

Is the Church of Czechoslovak Hussites here, of course.
"Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are practically Catholic without the Pope."
I know many people who are Catholics but attend worship services with Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are mostly liberal.
"They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street."
"Other than the Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square, it belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 PM they celebrate Mass in Latin, as it was celebrated before Vatican II."
The English translation for this sentence is: "The Christmas tree from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it over from Austria."
"Břeclav - A burning candle in Betlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic."
"They picked him up because of the coronavirus pandemic, but even this time they did not go to Vienna, in the morning they were picked up by their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav."

The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the section, and we are looking forward to it very much.

The subsequent transport of the light will be taken care of by scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and personal trains on Saturday, December 18th.
"From them, the light will be taken over at local scout stations or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where trains do not go."
"I letos musí skauti dodržovat platná opatření proti šíření koronaviru."  English translation: "Scouts must comply with valid measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus."
The translation for this sentence is: "It happens similarly to that."
"We are giving recommendations to courier teams as well as organizers of local events, to of course wear face masks, to try to observe the distances, to be as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, to simply behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Lights event Zuzana Hrbková."
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and comfort at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope, a light that conquers darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been taking care of spreading it for more than 30 years.
"The action stands on the shoulders of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human interdependence."
"All current information, including a list of places where people can come for a candle, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz."

"I work in a factory where there are a million lights on the corridors saying "XY financed/co-financed project XY" and such a company is simply just artificially kept alive."
"This is not support for the company that gives work to x people, this is burning development when this company holds on and takes orders/employees from firms that could grow and be more productive after its collapse."
The English translation for "Naprostý souhlas, je to hrozný" is "Complete agreement, it is terrible."
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age can fall into some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that internet ads don't bother me, but then I realize that they have influenced me too - it's just that it's so common that people can't escape it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic advertising...
"This is all nonsense, words of a classic - I would have banned you from the internet."
"I have the feeling that this virus has its roots (but mainly in point 1):"
"I will not believe in something just because the majority believes it and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe in something less probable, it doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will assert that it is critical thinking."

Television is popularizing the trend of Christmas films, and they have two hundred premieres this year.
"Los Angeles - Kina, television stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen victim to the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will premiere a record number of over two hundred for their viewers."
The English translation for "Spočítal to provozovatel filmové databáze IMDb" is "This was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database."
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with the public in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being produced.
In 2022, four times more Christmas films were produced than in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those movies that have the word "Christmas" in their title, so the number of holiday films will be much higher in reality.
"Filmy that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed."
In the Czech Republic, these times are associated mainly with fairy tales, globally they are also popular, for example, with the films Home for the Holidays, Love on Top of the World, or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
The correct translation for the sentence is: "The true boom of Christmas photos only started in 2009, when an American cable television station, Hallmark, launched a special film series, which was remembered by the BBC server."
"Her Christmas project named Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful."
"Letos tato stanice začala své diváky na Vánoce ladit už 22. října a představí celkem 42 vánočního snímků."
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the overall total.
"In this magical period of the story, it doesn't matter that much, what's important is that there are plenty of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies titled "I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies," described with sarcasm this genre.
For women, it is a form of escape and a way to at least feel a sense of calm for a couple of hours amidst all the holiday craziness and insanity of the world we live in, added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark Television uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end of something, some misunderstanding occurs, but it is resolved successfully and they kiss.
"It's the same all around, and as long as all the movies are similar and have a similar atmosphere, people will follow one after another, according to Gray."

The English translation for "Kalifornie omezí prodej zbraní" is "California restricts the sale of firearms."
"I want to proceed as Texas does with the ban on abortions."
Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and production of certain firearms in the most populous state in the United States using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial fetal heartbeat abortion law.
People had the right to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms in California.
The announcement by Newsoma responded to the Friday position of the US Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas ban on abortions, despite almost 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion nationwide roughly up to the 24th week of pregnancy.
However, he did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on a technical issue that arises from the innovative construction of the measures.
"The prohibition on speech was thus transferred to the public, thereby preventing its attack through ordinary legal channels by Texan Republicans."
"I am outraged by the recent (Friday) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on the majority of abortion services and to a large extent supported Texas's maneuver to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block reviews of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
"He is said to have entrusted his subordinates to work together with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would empower representatives of the public to enforce a ban on attack rifles and so-called ghost weapons."
"This is how homemade weapons are designated, which do not have serial numbers and may be used to circumvent regulations."
Newsom wants private citizens to have the right to demand damages of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone in California who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons, parts for "ghost guns," or kits for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these frightening weapons out of our streets is by creating a threat of private lawsuits, then we should do it precisely," said the California governor.
The Agency AP reports that California has for decades banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but a federal judge in the state recently blocked this ban as unconstitutional.
"If it now really is the case that the statute has been renewed using the Texas template, confirmed would be the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other US states."
The highest court did not grant complete immunity to Texas's abortion ban, and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against certain actors in the southern state of the USA.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget.
According to Ziobra by the European Commission acted in violation of the law if it used new powers and due to a dispute over the legal state of Poland suspended payment of funds to Poland.
"The committee has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the European fund for the revival of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."
"It is under pressure from the European Parliament to proceed further and use the mechanism allowing the withdrawal of EU funding from countries violating the principles of the rule of law."
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU by vetoing in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, leader of the small Solidaristic Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its obligations in European energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
"If the conflict continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU."
"It is justifiable to criticize the EU for denying us access to funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, said the Polish minister."
"His stance on access to the EU takes more radical positions than the ruling party of Justice and Truth."
According to the changes made by the European Commission, which the Polish justice system underwent during Ziobro's tenure, these changes pose a threat to its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
"Brussels according to Ziobro sets 'impossible conditions', because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political dictatorship imposed through extortion and an attempt to undermine democratic decisions made by several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
"He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control."
He said that his party will never agree to concessions to Brussels that would result in the limitation of Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland being a colony," he declared.

"It never was due to marks, it was mostly that I repeatedly refused to listen and annoyed (read instead of going to sleep, doing the dishes, etc.)."
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mother always threatened me first, saying that if I did it again, I would get a bruise (sometimes even after another "screaming fit" she would just bring in the saucepan and place it in front of me so that I could see it).
Only then, after I had repeatedly refused to listen, did I get a few slaps on the back (despite my clothes).
Personally, I believe that physical punishment (in reasonable implementation and measure) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than to words.
In my opinion, the part about warning is important because it gives children a choice of whether to listen or not and whether to improve or not, so that the punishment will not be necessary.
"Eventually, I mostly just needed a warning that I should start listening."
The English translation for "Obrana systému" is "System defense."
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him - whether it is the sacred document on which one takes an oath and which one learns about in school from an early age, or on the other hand, a treaty that can be changed in case of need - he clearly leaned towards the first option.
"We once agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which also define who we are as a state and our citizens, and it is better to conserve changes with them."
Imagine this: some nations actually enjoy their rules.
"As Czechs like knedlík with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl then answered the question."
"However, in recent times, the view among lawyers that the Czech Republic's Constitution needs changes is becoming increasingly common."
"Léta has been tested in situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, such as behavior of a directly elected president."
In one thing, Cepl was right.
"All that we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be carefully considered."
Understanding and actively defending the institute is necessary, only then can it be the key to coping with the majority of crises that society faces across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of governance order consisting of individual rules that establish the rules of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that the power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with restrictions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to wield their power.
COVID cannot be avoided, and in FN Brno, a few months old baby is fighting for its life.
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals are dealing with mainly in recent times.
"We know that children are endangered and affected less than adults, speaking of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, the head of the Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic at the University Hospital Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University.
The course is significantly simpler, lighter, and often occurs without symptoms.
"These are pediatric patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, it is about ten children who require mild support care.
"It takes place at a children's infectious disease clinic."
"Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU."
"Children with post-covid syndromes were continuously on the ward according to the doctor throughout the entire year."
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, which means they have pneumonia with inflammation of the lungs that requires hospitalization in an intensive care unit," he said and added that this illness affects not only adults but also adolescents and even toddlers.
Children in a serious condition due to COVID-19 can also be found in hospitals.
"At present, we have a child of several months to adolescent age lying here," said the chief physician.

"Vicki Holland from Britain mistreated a monkey kitten named Milly."
The frightening close-ups show the moment when the terrified monkey was convulsing in the toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it away and laughed at it.
"Holland's cows were also fed with pork, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs."
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
The experts on rehabilitating apes who are taking care of Milly after her abuse have declared that they have never seen such a traumatized astronaut.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with workers at Monkey World in Dorset and now happily plays with another rescued monkey named Moon.
"A quadruple mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal."
"The magistrate court in Gwent imposed on her a 12-month suspended sentence with a one-year conditional release."
"Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay court costs in the equivalent of 12,000 crowns."
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the oppressed animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is doing well, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
Milly waited until she got used to people again.
She crept and hid herself from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
"Opička refused to eat for a long time."
"Now that she has settled down and is content with the male, her view of new people can still provoke panic."
"Psychic scars from abuse will always accompany her, adds Sawyer."
The abuse of Milly was revealed after the police in Gwent discovered disturbing videos on her phone following a raid on her apartment due to an accusation of drug use.
"On the recordings, you can hear Milly using vulgar language."
"On the next video, you can hear Holland offering monkeys cocaine and saying: "Do you want cocaine?""

"In her home, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (approximately 49,000 crowns) was found hidden in Kinder egg containers."
"Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland received a conditional sentence of 20 months."

"This is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," replied Andrea on Instagram in Stories to all the curious questions from fans who wanted to know what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
"Between Kadrim and Andreou, there was a fly buzzing from the beginning of the experiment."
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his assumption was that Andrea would leave for him, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
"Ta to ale rezolutně odmítala." translates to "But she rejected it firmly." in English.
As you can see, their relationship did not end with love, but rather evolved into mutual contempt.
"It was all planned from you! Kadri's reaction to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts made him angry."
The apparent honesty of Kadri's now ex-wife did not please even his younger sister Linda.
"She decided to publicly support her brother."
"Normally, I don't express myself to such things at all and we never really talk about them in our family."
"I am definitely not trying to evoke any pity."
"But when I see someone who is trying to publicly discredit and slander the name of someone I love so much, it just doesn't sit well with me!"
"I'm sorry that I have to do this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though he was young at the time."
"I hate it even more when I have to read such false information that is probably taken out of context."
"I would dearly love for all of you to know Kadri as I do, our close friends and family, in response to the words of Andrew."
"I am really grateful for everything!"
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love and know him better than anyone else and know the truth about what really happened.

The English translation for the sentence is:  "An American woman entered into a mutual battle as a mental 'dwarf', Nunesova had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph."
"The beginning of the duel also carried the spirit of paper assumptions."
Nunesová started her journey to victory by being very active and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
"She however did not let herself be persuaded to make any further mistakes and unsuccessfully attempted to attack with a hook on her hand."
The second round was exciting and very intriguing for MMA fans.
Both competitors frequently used a large number of outstanding strikes and hard hooks.
"In addition, Nunes gave her a pen on the ground, where she began to scratch her."
The English translation for the sentence "Ta musela snahu vzdát a atak odklepat" is "You must have the courage to repel the attack."
"An American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion."
The peak of the card was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the title in the lightweight division.

In the second attempt, Oliveira tried to be more active and struck his opponent's hand with a hook.
"It was too difficult for him, but he then created a big pressure, got his opponent on his back and pounded him with a series of punches."
"Thanks to this, the second round won."

"Ten kyčel, nebo ta kyčel?" is a Czech sentence that translates to "Which cheek, or which cheek?" in English.
"At first glance, it doesn't seem to be anything complicated."
The majority of nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and it is therefore not a problem to determine whether it is masculine, feminine, or neutral.
"Do you also have a relatively large group of nouns with unstable gender, where the gender is not established?"
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
"During declension, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an uninflected form."
For example, words such as "svízel" or "kyčel" are of the masculine and feminine gender, they are declined in the first according to the pattern "stroj" and in the second according to the pattern "píseň".
In other groups of nouns, different forms are used in the first singular case, such as "row/rows" (in the sense of a line), "horseshoe/horseshoes" or "potatoes/potatoes" (in the sense of a food).
Both these forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
"Some expressions may differ regionally, for example, "cucumber" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case, however, the Moravian variant is unwritten, just like other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "canal" and "canal," "goulash" and "goulash," etc."
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but they gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is of the masculine gender and also of the feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which remains in the middle gender and is declined in the masculine gender but has endings according to the model "fortress" in the masculine gender.

"Czech houses under construction are flooded, families do not have money to complete them."
"Prices of building materials in the last weeks and months have risen by more than 30 percent."
"A lot of people got into a difficult situation because of it."
"He doesn't have the means to complete unfinished family homes and banks are refusing to increase his mortgage."
"In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing."
People do not have enough money to complete already partially built family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, which creates extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the best case, people move into half-built and uninspected houses.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they can't afford to pay off the loans and also pay rent, says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
"For the year, we are setting up two to three family houses and at fifty percent, it is happening to us."
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to have to comply with certain contractual things even when the material has become expensive.

"Most people will only have financial problems."
"Did you calculate that the construction of the house would cost five million, but now it will be seven?"
"I think some will be waiting," added Slivoň.
The material most inspired me was copper, iron, and also installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in technical fields, and the influx of foreign workers is hindered by the pandemic.

What is the fundamental thing we have learned?
"I will receive my diploma super right away, I have my own topic which I chose, I always do it throughout the year and then in a week or two I will write the written part."
"The statutes are completely calm with us, unless a person is a total monkey and something remains in his head, then that commission will not uselessly drown him in theory."
"You might have learned about state attorneys for a week, and when I was in trouble, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical deduction that I could use, and I had it right away."
"Other than those projects, I know people who paid someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, it was really beneficial, we learned a lot) and then they just learn the project and have it done."
According to me, it's great when at the end of the subject there is a test that checks the knowledge acquired within the project, not just the defense.

"I am afraid that I will have to reduce myself to a tic-tac-toe game where many artists from my field have success and almost don't allow it."

"Just before, the same people who destroyed the Białowieża Forest in one sitting, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War)."
Consciously deindustrialized, hindered agriculture, and detached fourteen republics, which were previously economically connected in a single mechanism, from the largest world power.
"If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, the decline of science, the army, the rise of crime, ethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, first abandoning the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union."
There is such a concept in political science as "vacuum of force".
"Everything that was abandoned and surrendered in a hurry was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation."
The whole world is still shaken mainly due to events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
"The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality."
On Monday, we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
"I'll buy it with the understanding that I'll put it in the refrigerator and make it into a Friday night dinner."
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy meat on Monday, the butcher chain will lower the price to 99 Kč / kg on Tuesday - explain to me the mechanism by which a change in the price of meat becomes a burden for my digestive system?

The English translation for the sentence "Jak pandemie ovlivnila intimní život: Roste počet lidí do 35 let, kteří jsou bez sexu celý rok" is "How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are sexless for the whole year is increasing."
The English translation for the sentence "Čím dál více mladých dospělých v USA žije své životy bez sexu" is "Ever more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex."
"It mainly refers to religiously-based people, according to the DailyMail website."
The survey showed that the share of people under 35 who renounce sexual life has risen from eight to 21 percent from 2008 to 2021.
"Women between 18 and 35 years old who reported having no sexual activity in the past year is more than ever before."
"The decrease in the number of sexually active individuals contributes to other factors, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS)."
"One of them could be economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and a higher unemployment rate."
"Contribution could also be the presence of media, social networks, or video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people."
"Since 2010, the share of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they did not have sex in the previous year is rapidly increasing," said researcher Lyman Stone of IFS.
In married couples, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them stating that they were sexless in the past year.
"Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage."
"The decrease in sexual activity also contributes to fear of premarital contact and religious foundations."
Although the probability of being sexually active is higher among married couples, the percentage of married and unmarried young people under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's view on premarital sex divides, about 30% consider it to be a bad thing, while around 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group, there is a minority, but their behavior pushes this trend," says Stone about these thirty percent.
"For the majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious foundations."
Since 2008, the proportion of young people under 35 who are religious and attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
"Between those who are less religious, the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone declared.
"The decline in sexual activity is also contributed by other factors, such as less social interactions and especially social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic."
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller among people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
"This trend was mainly used during lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic."

My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he couldn't be vaccinated and died.
"On the other hand, I don't think that we can blame the SPD and KSČ for the death of the stubborn opponent of vaccination, who is dragging something about shaming and totalitarian state along with him."
"From the statistics that I mentioned, it can be clearly inferred that the majority of the unvaccinated elderly likely belong to the second group, so they will truly be able to take care of themselves."

"We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relationships," said Morawiecki at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
"Crisis, caused by worrying movements of Russian troops near Ukrainian borders, is according to the chancellor worth solving through diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the "Normandy format", which includes France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine."
Morawiecki stated that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons because every night we record hundreds of attempts at (illegal) border crossing.
"The Chancellor was negotiating about further sanctions in order to make it clear to Lukašenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU."
According to the DPA agency, Scholz has confirmed that Warsaw is enjoying German support in its dispute with Belarus, and has condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime towards runners.

The leader of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that it appears that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at 10 Downing Street in December, when a lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
"One minister in Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually", through a computer."
However, groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street also participated in it.
In Britain, there is pressure for the removal of Johnson from the premiership.
During the winter of December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous banquets despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged, claiming that Johnson and his government made a laughingstock of them.
Paul Brand, the editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Boris Johnson won by a landslide in the general elections two years ago.
"Today, the Conservative Party is speaking about the need to remove him from the position of prime minister."

What are the signs of this new approach that you are speaking about?
Yes, that is one of those new things.
"Everything begins with language."
"I was a bit chubby quite often, especially when I was 14. My parents don't have much patience, neither do I. My dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me)."
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a child, to the extent that I lay on the ground in a cramp and was all blue, twice they took me under the shower to calm me down.
"Sometimes I felt educational, but it was more often that I didn't know."
"I definitely have a tendency to solve things violently, as a child I was quite mischievous, now I at least try to do something to stand out, and as a younger person, I have to placate my parents somehow (so they don't get too much power), so I never do anything extreme, but I always have that urge."
"I cannot determine to what extent it is my impulsiveness, but certainly upbringing also has its share in it."
I'm afraid I will lose patience with my children and handle it the same way.
I think that beating children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at a time when it wasn't "educational" but rather out of frustration. On the other hand, perhaps every parent just does something wrong, so maybe it's impossible to completely avoid spoiling their children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them.
"It doesn't bother me in any way, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of something."

"The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a storage facility is nowhere to be found."
"The design of Minister Karl Havlicek requires fundamentally reworking."
"The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at the end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist."
"The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal which the Ministry of Industry and Trade presented to the government after long delays."
"However, his content is in serious conflict not only with the affected communities united in the Platform against the deep deposit, but also with the Czech Union of Towns and Villages."
Local authorities are expected to significantly strengthen their decision-making powers regarding the storage facility, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when work on this legislation began and which is required by both the Czech nuclear law and European directives.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The criticism of the draft law proposed by Minister Karel Havlicek, which is available to the Platform, mainly concerns: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for a waste repository is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
"Effective can only be when the communities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a particular location."
"To lze zajistit uložením povinnosti Správy úložišť vyžádat si před zahájením konkrétního řízení souhlas dotčených obcí."
The proposed draft concept almost entirely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipality mere statistics in the permit proceedings.
"In the proposal, there is a lack of a system for setting compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for a storage facility, its permitting, and operation."
"Representatives of municipalities do not have many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a site for a waste disposal facility according to current legal regulations."
In some licensing proceedings, they may submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister in whose interest the license is issued.
"Potential lawsuit does not have a delaying effect on the conduct of exploratory or construction work."
The decision-making of self-government, which the Platform requests, is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where storage has already been authorized, such as in Sweden or Finland.
"Preparation of the law is also another failure of state administration, which hires external legal offices for the preparation of legislation."
In this case, it is about a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which SÚRAO has concluded and which is a continuation of contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works according to the register of contracts is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, the mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson for the Platform against the Deep Geological Repository, said: "After the industry ministers, who equalized the position of local self-government in relation to state authorities when seeking a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste, only passed the responsibility on to their successors, we are waiting for a significant change from the new government."
"I offer a helpful hand for that."
"We also thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities for recognizing the problem of insufficient rights for municipalities in relation to such a fundamental building, in a similar way to directly affected municipalities in selected locations."
"The platform against deep geological storage unites 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) with the aim of advocating for a change in the state's approach to handling burnt nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological storage."
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for potential storage be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.

"A game like Dark Souls, for example, has several bosses, and then there is the final boss."
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
"These are games of the type Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly encounter them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be given some kind of name?"
The English translation for "No a pak jsou mini bossové" is "And then there are mini bosses."
The English translation for the sentence is:  "Translating 'boss' into a single-word phrase is difficult, if not impossible. Czech and other languages can't handle it either. Interestingly, Catalan is the only language that translates 'boss' as the final opponent."

"Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla."
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month with the approaching end of the year saw a significant increase in attacks.
"We recorded a large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th."
Attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attacker's strategy remains the same for the time being.
The translated sentence is: "An attached file in an email will arouse user attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions."
While the previous month had a dangerous attachment in the name with the word "faktura," this time it was labeled as "Copy of account repair invoice for 11/2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
"Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex."
"Malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials and then sends them to attackers."
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is again increasing.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists captured mainly campaigns with a global reach in November.
In comparison with the November data from Formbook, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still stands for almost half of all detections.
Attacks occurred continuously throughout the entire month with increased activity on days 3, 10, and 15 of November.
The formbook usually contained an attachment with the suffix .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
"But the account name still keeps appearing."
"The attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user."
The significant decrease and weakening of activity are indicated by security analysts in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6% of attacks and had no major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic in recent months.

It is difficult to say what movement could emerge from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money but also on whether the Pfizer triple vaccine becomes a four or more dose vaccine.

"Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she rode home from work on the south side of the British metropolis."
According to information about the employee of a children's hospital, in addition to the police, her previous employer or the member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived is also called.
"The disappearance of Petra is in no way similar to her behavior and we are very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor, a police officer from the Lambeth neighborhood where Srncová worked, in her Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and they just want to know where she is," she continued.
The Czech woman, according to her, left work around 19:45 on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
"Lastly, she was reportedly seen on a bus about half an hour later."
"Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on December 3rd."
According to British media, she worked as a "healthcare assistant" in the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
"We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said the group of healthcare facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help us find her to come forward."

In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a cover caught my eye.
The translation for "Šlo o život" is "It was about life."
The magistrate referred the complaints to the ŘSD, to which the road belongs, but since it allegedly did not react, the hole in the ground continued to expand.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began to "intensively deal with the situation".
