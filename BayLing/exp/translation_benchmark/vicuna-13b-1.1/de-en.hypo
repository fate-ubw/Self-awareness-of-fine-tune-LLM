The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
"I am a #PRS\_ORG# large customer and thus it is no problem for me."
"I need only a number or instruction on what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you."
"I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€."
The English translation for "Heute kostet sie 179€" is "Today it costs 179€."
"I find that honestly quite annoying."
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for a better price or is there another way to get the discount?
I think it is generally not a good idea to burden children with the responsibility of taking on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I believe that taking care of younger siblings in moderation also does well for older siblings.
The English translation for this sentence is: "Look for a short time, help for a short time, bring the bottle for a short time."
"So they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved."
"As long as they are still able to take care of themselves, I don't see a problem."
"If your K1 is happy to be alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good."
You can best determine if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he has to wrap K2 and stay with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
The English translation for the sentence "Vielleicht kommt daher auch die Aussage der Psychologin" is "Maybe that's why the statement by the psychologist is also true."
"For if something were to actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2."
"Whether this is now a risk that you want to take is of course up to you ;) "
"Please help me find the title of a book again!"
"I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and although I can still recall almost the entire plot, the title refuses to come to mind. Maybe someone here knows something?"
The story dealt with fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself with feed and going into the enclosure with his predators.
"The case is taken over by a female detective who, after brief investigation, ends up at the therapist's clinic where he treats patients with anxiety."
The detective has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist.
"There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it, and then post the photos on the internet."
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately have to confront their fear to the greatest extent possible.
"A woman jumps out of the window, another one deliberately kills herself."
"This which stands against fear will be referred to in the book as 'the fight.'"
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with fire.
"This is the rough action, I am quite sure that the book was written by a French author / authoress in the original."
"If this action is known to someone or if someone even tells me the title of the book, I would be very pleased."
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the WiFi.
"Do I have to contact my husband first?"
"That can last."
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to receive the price difference back?

"The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family."
"Through the combination of a digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, and can thus fit it into nearly any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0."
The English translation for the sentence is: "LokSound 5 Decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "Sugar cube" speaker with a sound capsule set."

The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC System.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake elements or with direct current.
Furthermore, he also holds a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automatic allows for automatic pendulum travel between two stations.
The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on both analog DC and AC trains.

"Remove #NUMBER# € from my shopping cart and order elsewhere where customer service is prioritized and I don't have to type on my phone to nowhere to achieve nothing!"
What should I do with this number then?
"Wegen Omikron: Johnson will Auffrischimpfung vorantreiben" translates to "Because of Omikron: Johnson will drive forward with the booster dose."
"Always new Omikron cases are causing politics and science in Great Britain."
"Therefore, all adults in England who qualify should receive a vaccine offer until New Year."
"London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster than previously planned with the Corona refresh immunizations in light of rapidly rising Omikron numbers."
"Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, said Johnson on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen."
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
"Man stands facing the Omikron variant in the face of an emergency, which is why the need for vaccination reinforcement is urgent, said Johnson."
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose.
"Let's boost now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of Omikron were recorded in Great Britain, bringing the total number to 3137.
"In comparison to yesterday, it was an increase of 65 percent."
"Will the full price be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?"
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I sent a job application.
The English translation for "Heute kam die Einladung zu einem Gespräch per Mail" is "The invitation for a conversation by email arrived today."
I want to respond to the email.
"But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name."
"I have googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman."
"I have no idea how I should write the email now."
"Can someone please help me?"
"I am a foreigner and do not want to step on the feet of any officials."
Conclusion: everyone should familiarize themselves with pronouns.
"I have a total of 5 books."
Four of them are going.
"Only the one thing that I bought today doesn't work."
The English translation for the sentence "Offensichtlich hatte der Stuhl einen nicht ersichtlichen Mangel bei Verkauf" is "Apparently, the chair had an invisible flaw at the time of sale."
"How can such a pillow injury occur after 9 months otherwise?"
"First attempted on #PRS\_ORG#."
This sentence is in German and it translates to "This works but has been since approximately."
The English translation for "14 Tagen nicht mehr" is "14 days no longer."
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and I wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none.
"Now they are available again, and I would like to please add 2 chairs to the order and send me the invoice."
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something about domestic violence in detail here.
The English translation for "Ich muss mir einfach mal was von der Seele schreiben" is "I just need to write something for my soul."
"I often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons."
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs all too frequently is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or believe that we cannot help them.
To me, it is quite clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things that move me more in my profession than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
"Even in a conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them."
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
"What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence."
I would like for all women to know that they do not simply have to take violence.
"I often wish that I could help... I know that I can't."
The English translation for "Leichter wird es dadurch aber nie" is "It will never become lighter through this, but."
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth for "League of Legends"?
"Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently started on Netflix. It features a lot of fantasy, many complicated names, and an awe-inspiring production.
"Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?"
"Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby Disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim"
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick, reliance was placed.
"Again nothing: For the second time within barely three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!"
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had commented on the team's cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, saying: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
"She did not lie down after the game, but rather increased her intensity in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga."
"Where more than the bare result, the manner and style of the performance disappointed."
The English translation for the sentence is: "A statistics that expresses the entire dilemma is named: The three-point percentage was just 13%, 4 shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?"
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not concentrated enough after our victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, to move the ball.
"His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: 'It's a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time', said the happy coach."
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
"Therefore, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their own expense."
Not only because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided his team's game.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," Gleim praised yet.
"While the performance players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed to perform on the entire line in Patrick's team."
"Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete disaster and managed to get within eight points, after already being behind by 39:59."
"Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points."
Unfortunately, there is not much time left for brooding.
"Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, and then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators."
"We had a different email address before, but I changed it."
Yes, I have already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
"We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again as a result."
"We have registered ourselves originally already half a year ago."
"Stets wie aus dem Ei gepellt: Max Raabe wird 59" translates to "Always popped out of the egg: Max Raabe is turning 59."
He is able to delight his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
"At present, he is traveling with the program 'Good day, dear luck' - if he is allowed to perform."
In actuality, Max Raabe should have celebrated his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
The English translation for "Doch daraus wird nichts" is "But nothing comes of it."
The planned concert has been rescheduled to May 2022 due to government instructions to contain the COVID-19 virus.
"Other of his planned appearances in Advent have to fall through first, as it says on the website of the singer who turns 59 today and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de)."
"From January, the artists then want to make up for their concerts that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020."
Born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung much and loved it since his youth.
"In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with his fellow students."
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place in the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has taken it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair strictly pulled back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe cannot be forgotten in the current German-speaking music scene.
"With the program 'Good morning, dear luck' he has been on tour since 2020."
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to receive a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance?
"It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check earlier whether it fits colorwise."
"It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but can't turn the pages."
"Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created through expropriation."
The new Federal Housing Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a Berlin referendum.
"With expropriation, no single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security, so that their rent remains affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations is actually the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin will the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party set up an expert commission to determine how to handle the results of the national referendum.
"But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude talks with the FDP in the coalition of the Ampel on further tightening of the rental law."
The coalition contract provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation on rent increases in strained housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
"I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible."
"If the rental market does not relax despite this, 'we will talk with coalition partners about further steps', emphasized the SPD politician."
Hello, I wanted to place an order and it has occurred to me a few days later that I forgot the last step in payment.

"That is an absolute audacity."
At least 100 people were killed by tornadoes in Kentucky.
"During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been drawn through the USA."
"Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be regretted."
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
"On the night to Saturday, multiple tornadoes have caused severe damage in the USA and possibly claimed up to one hundred fatalities."
"The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer trail of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky."
"The governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had swept through, everything was gone."
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
"Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees."
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He is calculating alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred deaths, the official numbers are rising minute by minute.
Hello, I just saw that they sold Vitrine #NAME# out.
"That is very unfortunate."

"Is it completely removed from the product line?"
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?

"If delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!"
"I understand that, but can I now order the ceiling that is in the shopping cart and have it shipped to Germany?"
"I had sent an article back through the contact form or given a return, and I wanted to inquire if it had arrived or been processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation."
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money premiums for vaccination.
"With this, they are on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination."
"Even the redesign of advertising slogans into vaccine appeals - modeled after the German example - should increase readiness for COVID-19 vaccinations."
He has changed jobs to a company he has criticized.
This sentence translates to "This does not improve his situation better than yours."
The English translation for "Abwarten und Tee trinken" is "Waiting and drinking tea."
It is a year ago.

The English translation for "Das darfst du auch" is "You can also do that."
The English translation for this sentence is: "And that he didn't like you back then, well, whatever. "
He didn't like his job either.
"There are too many variables."
"Please take the cancellation."
"That will then be legally relevant."
I am taking a screenshot.
"Good day - I am interested in the Boone dining table, White."
Is there also in Great 230cm?
"We offer all Smeg kitchen appliances and corresponding accessories in our online shop kitchenpoint.de."
"We review the quality and completeness of your order fundamentally."
The new coffee espresso machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee to your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matt colors in combination with the matt brushed stainless steel front make the new SMEG coffee machine with milk frother into a design object.
With the reduced design, all functions such as coffee strength and water quantity, as well as the ability to choose between espresso, americano, ristretto, or a mild coffee with only four buttons can be selected.
"Thanks to the steam plant, specialties such as coffee milk and milk foam can also be prepared."
"Help with first own campaign"
The English translation for "Boron zum Grusse!" is "Long live boron!"
"I am currently leading an adventure for a group of 4 friends over the Greifenpass and want to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a campaign specifically written for players."
The English translation for "Wir spielen DSA 5" is "We are playing DSA 5."
"The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts imagined, and now I am working on the starting adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter."
The premise is that the heroes are tasked with delivering a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-Sea.
"There should develop further action."
"Several miles from the village, a group of goblins should ambush the hero and lure him into an ambush."
I want to give the player characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in various ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to mind to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers armed.
"The goblins wait for the hero in a hollow way and surround him to the left and right with bows, while two with spears stop the carriage."
"Should it come to battle and the heroes be defeated, I have two solutions in mind."
"The heroes are all found unconscious and subsequently discovered by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf, and are healed."
"The cart is, of course, gone."
"Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf even summons two of his servants and comes to the aid of the hero in battle."
"The cart is still there, everything is great."
"How appropriately do you implement Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?"
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into adventure?
The group of Goblins will later play a crucial role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
"EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips."
"I will certainly adopt many of your ideas and now also have more confidence in my narrative."
I reassembled the lamp again.
The English translation for "Und wieder zusammen gesteckt" is "And again stuck together."
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
"Therefore, I would still like to send her back despite that."

Please choose DHL, as only DHL is allowed to deliver to DHL stations.
"We will send you an email with the tracking number, if you have selected DHL or DPD as the sender."
"So, you can check around 10:00 p.m. where your package is located."

The English translation for "Ich bin einfach nur darauf gesessen" is "I'm just sitting here."
"Here was the lower part, so basically the part with storage space damaged."
"Is everything going to be picked up again or just the storage part?"
"I am fed up with Sky Sport F1."
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has continuously deteriorated, so I'm taking the opportunity to vent a bit in this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race today to begin the F1 pre-reportage punctually.
Although the start was delayed and there was an accident, the timetable was far behind schedule, but they could still have shown the last ten minutes and the championship decision.
Apparently, it is but that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE here probably had no choice.
Despite being dumb, especially since Sky UK ended up broadcasting the race.
"Despite a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well."
Then there was again knowledge of the rules in Formula 1 among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both knew that you cannot change tires under a red flag.
Although it had already happened in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both drivers only came to the decision that Verstappen could change the tires when there were appropriate radio messages about this topic directed at Hamilton.
"Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen."
I believe that such elementary rules should be known simply if one comments on the F1 at a pay-TV channel.
"It is also not the first puzzle-solving that is now allowed or prescribed according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules."
In general, the artificial commenting style of Roos does not appeal to me, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
"Additionally, there are constant foolishnesses that both simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or 'UuuuuHD' from Ralf Schumacher."
"Just the latter causes a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously."
"Not only does advertising simply take over at Sky, in the final lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available immediately after the race."
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
"These two broadcasters also make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster."
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
"Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1."
"Unironically, RTL does a better job at the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising."
Therefore, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
"I would be interested in your opinion."
"On the here: #PRS\_ORG#-pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1"
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week but still hasn't been delivered.
"I have contacted the chat twice and nothing yet."
The English translation for this sentence is: "The First Lady told me that it will be shipped on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will review and send an email and she has never responded."
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the chair).
The English translation for "Ich bitte um Unterstützung" is "I am asking for support."
"Lüfterpumpen are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium."
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifters.
"This series is offered in 3 variations by us."
"Look at the end of the offer in the table."
"You can see the performances there in comparison."
"Are the pumps strong enough to operate the entire system?"
"Does one have a large aquarium, suitable pumps with 2 or more outlets, so that one can connect more outflows?"
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model pump, but fans are also available to set a accent in the aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decor that converts bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar to name.
The MK series has a special, sound-absorbing construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The translation for "Die Installation ist sehr einfach" in English is "The installation is very easy."
The translator pump is connected to an air hose 4/6 mm to an air outlet or the like...and it's ready to go.
The air pump should be equal, or higher than the water level and mounted outside.
"Sitzt die Lüfterpumpe tiefer than the water level, one should put a check valve in between to prevent a backflow."
"Cut the air mattress simply by piercing it and placing the valve in between."
"This would prevent water from flowing backward, which is the water flowing out of the pond through the pump..."
"Should the air pump be installed outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, cover it and protect it from moisture."
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we specify a processing time of 3 days on eBay, packages are processed daily and picked up daily as well.
"Everything is going well on the way, it's going very fast."
"We just want to take precautions so that no one is offended because it once took a little longer."
"It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry...of course, here Corona is not making a halt."
"Please do not rate it badly just because delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the package services."

"Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and moderator into space."
"The daughter of the first US American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers have made a short trip into space."
"They were transported by the 'New Shepard' rocket system of the company Blue Origin founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Saturday."
"Start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas."
"Under a bright blue sky, Jeff Bezos himself received the freshly trimmed astronauts upon their return."
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
"Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder."
According to Blue Origin, they were in space for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
"The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who was named after the rocket system of Blue Origin, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineering engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron."
"How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share."
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
"Just come along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh."
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
The moderator would rather go back into space again, he said.
"New Shepard" flies up to a height of 100 kilometers.
The rocket system "New Shepard" largely flies autonomously.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of approximately 100 kilometers above the Earth, with weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes as it landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned spaceflight of Blue Origin: During the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
"During the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the vice president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers, were present."
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without considering the impact on the climate.
"By selecting a touch of a button, you easily choose whether your 'Smart Stone' will permanently glow in a color or run through its entire color palette."
"Set to color change, the glow stone retains a light color for approximately one minute before transitioning gently to the next decorative color."
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp ensures it lasts for a whole year outdoors.
In a snowy environment, its light even shows up particularly well - only with delayed luminance can be expected once the days become shorter.
Please pay attention in winter that no snow impairs the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMH battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format which can be easily replaced as needed.
"You can obtain a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the service life of your Dekoleuchte even further."

The English translation for the sentence is: "DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in operation in Silesia and Central Germany, this very rare locomotive is likely to have come from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968, used with playing surface and defects, see photos, the function is good. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy goods electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network. Possibly, the construction set also
"A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and it is operational after being overhauled."
In 1924, the German Reich Railway Company had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
"As the highest speed was demanded at 65 km/h."
In March 1926, the DRG determined that they would receive the locomotive as a "1'C+C1' Co-Co locomotive with Tatzlager drive" from AEG, with the delivery of the mechanical parts, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke would deliver the electrical parts.
"From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were assigned the operating numbers E 95 01-06."
"All survived World War II and found themselves afterwards on the territory of the later DDR."
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered as reparations to the Soviet Union.
"They returned to Germany by November 1952."
"The Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau has determined the restorability of all six locomotives."
"As the progressive electrification of the central German network led to an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors."
"Therefore, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 that were available in larger quantities were prioritized for assembly first."
"Only after it became clear that the processing number could no longer be further increased did the E 95 come into focus for processing."
"First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway maintenance facility."
"They came to the railway repair shop in Halle P in 1960."
"You were usually deployed in your own circular route, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal heading towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt."
"Problematic became the complex control of the locomotives with increasing age."
It often happened that Schütze remained stuck during switching operations.
Then the fireman who constantly traveled on this locomotive had to use a hammer and wooden mallet to release the safety valve during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to prolonged outages for the locomotive.
"By the end of the 1960s, sufficient new construction locomotives were available and there was no clear expansion of the electrical operation at that time, so that the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the sub-types, thus the E 95 were taken out of service."
In addition to them, the German Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one man on board, which would have resulted in a problem with the operation of the train due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
"After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5, 1970."
"The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used."
"All the locomotives were disassembled except for the E 95 02."
"The E 95 02 was placed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a track heating unit on the main station in Halle."
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external processing of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it as a vehicle exhibition in the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive since then.
In 1986, the locomotive was fully completed internally.
"In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is museally cared for."
"Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational readiness of the locomotive."
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with its new inner and outer paint, where the transformers were inspected and five motors were found to be operational.
"The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements."
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
The English translation for "Haupteinsatzgebiet war zunächst Schlesien" is "The main area of deployment was initially Silesia."

"Residential fire with two minor injuries and significant damage."
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
"Additionally, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday."
"The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district)."
According to the information provided, two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not initially suspect a deliberate act of arson.
The police station in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.

To weaken fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo.
"Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network 'LinkedIn' in early 2021."
"Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously publicly expressed his vaccine status."
The entrepreneur published a photo that shows his Corona vaccination.
"The illness of a friend has moved him to share with Şahin."
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo that shows him receiving a vaccination against COVID-19.
"There were false rumors on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated."
"Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn."
"For some months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated in order to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around himself.
"But a phone call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I found out that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe COVID-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
"The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further."
He did not ask about the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
"Angst can only be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences."
"An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated."
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German Wave also clearly stated.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said back then.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination.
"Meanwhile, prioritization has long been suspended - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements."
"Fire in substation: Tens of thousands without power"
"In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases also no heating."
A fire had rendered the substation inoperable.
"After a fire with heavy damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia will have to do without electricity for around 24 hours."
"Through the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities on Friday evening."
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power supplies had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance was finally completely remedied in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered supervision places in schools and called for help from the neighborhood.
The supplier expressed gratitude to the affected individuals for their patience and to the helpers for their efforts.
"We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions."
"We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire services, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, the head of the Primary Technology department, in a message on Saturday evening.
"The repair of the damage will take several more days, as the Westnetz electricians were able to put some cables back into operation only provisionally, he explained."
"A technical defect led to a fire according to company reports."
The English translation for "Strom fließt wieder" is "Electricity is flowing again."
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday in the Umspannstation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid has caused significant damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
"There would be necessary expensive cleaning and repair work there."
"Parallel to this, an attachment to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created."
"With the help of this bypass, the power supply is again available."
"Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again."
"An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually switched on from 9:30 p.m."
"Since 11:15 p.m., even the last ones affected by the outage would have had power."
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies had been deployed.
"The authorities called for neighborhood assistance on Saturday afternoon after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings."
"What is important now is that citizens take care of elderly or lonely people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire department equipment houses when help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
"Setting up and operating emergency power sources primarily focused on the residents of nursing homes."
"In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those who could not take care of themselves or who required power-dependent medical devices or medical supervision."

"Kinderwunschbehandlung bei PKV" translates to "Infertility Treatment with Private Health Insurance" in English.  "Versicherungsfall" translates to "Insurance Case" in English.
Hello everyone.
"We were in fertility treatment for a while, now when it comes to billing with the health insurance, it suddenly puts up a barrier."
In order, one after another.
"We had applied for the fertility treatment with the health insurance company in advance and received the approval for three attempts."
The attempts were in no way (such as time frame, success, etc.) limited.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was covered by the PKV (German statutory health insurance).
"After a while, we tried to have a second child and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet account for the PKV."
We applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted another three attempts.
After several more attempts (we have conducted more trials than promised, so logically we should deduct the most expensive ones from the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV only wants to compensate for 3 trials.
The translation for the sentence is: "The justification: The pregnancy/birth leads to the loss of the remaining two attempts of the first promise."
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, the "insurance case begins with treatment and ends when further treatment is no longer necessary."
The question to the experts in this round is:
"Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are covered) or we (5 attempts need to be made good)?"
"Should the PKV have indicated to us in the promises that with a birth the subsequent attempts would fall?"
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could share their opinions.
"Many thanks already for your help!"
"Can you please send me the three variants by email and let me know how I can access them again best?"
The English translation for "In Ordnung" is "In order."
The English translation for the sentence "Wir werden nichts mehr bei ihnen bestellen" is "We will no longer order anything from them."
"If they add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), it is obvious that they have lost a good customer."
"They can certainly forward it to their manager."
"That is not competitive."

"It is clear and obvious that the repayment was triggered and I have still not received a repayment via #PRS\_ORG#."

Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU associated.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime.
"But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania," Bossong told the Evangelical Press Agency (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, stated the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
"This state of balance - Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels itself as the winner - will probably continue for a while longer."
"The handling of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong."
It appears that there is a growing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments.
"Since the EU as a whole does not take a determined stance against it, it will be at the expense of fundamental rights."
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
"You can apparently not push through when a member state sets its mind to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its border.
"In addition, the EU pays a price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: An agreement on the principle of asylum policy will be difficult, as the line 'border protection, border protection, border protection' has been strengthened."
The English translation for "Erneuter Versuch der Grenzüberschreitung" is "Attempted border crossing."
According to the Border Guard of Poland, migrants have attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus again.
"55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and brought back to the border," said a spokesperson for the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked with stones by migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information provided, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
"In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours."
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border controls.
"Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months or tried to do so."
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being a dictator in Minsk and luring him with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have reportedly closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of people to prevent them from leaving.
"The most effective element of the EU's reaction was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong."
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
"Minsk must also consider internal political costs."
The Belarusian society may not be accustomed to the security apparatus regularly processing thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen should have committed two rule violations during the race.
"Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula-1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal."
"The silver arrows suspect two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year."
"A protest refers to a supposed breach by Max Verstappen of Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally."
A second objection was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in a rule-compliant manner.
"Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was on his way to his first Formula-1 title."
"The maneuver was performed shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch driver overtook vehicles in front of him."
The English translation for "Ich Prüfe das" is "I am checking it."
"I speak with the bank and report myself to you again."
"Thank you for the support."
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag.
The Europa Park, namesake for the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
"As the park announces, members and permanent card holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day."
"In addition, there were also coupons for drinks and sausages."
"The roller coaster trains lit up in red and white on this day."
"Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," so the park.
"Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg."
"At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it showed again how well the partnership fits."
"To see shining fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
"Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€?"

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
"Within the reading series 'LiteraTour Nord,' author Judith Hermann read from her current novel 'At Home' at a sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also served as the moderator."
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her door.
"I submitted the contact form for the return of an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar."
My question would be, whether my request has been taken into account.
Not everyone has the time for your slow chat and cheap junk from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not all from our household.
"Contact Frau #NAME#."
I cannot chat with them every day.
"We chatted yesterday and agreed that I/Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro discount, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# Nightstand, and a return shipping label."
This email has not come yet.
The package would like to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
"Please contact me."
The English translation for "Mit freundlichen Grüßen" is "With friendly greetings."
The LokSound 5 Decoder can simultaneously output up to 10 channels.
"Each channel can be resolved hereby up to 16 Bit / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your installation."
It is practically no difference audible from the original anymore.
"A Class-D audio output stage with up to 3W output power controls the speakers that can have impedance between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm."
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
"All individual sounds can be individually adjusted for loudness."

"Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles."
"Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite means nothing."
This is like when a thief says he has nothing against foreigners.
The English translation for the sentence "Ihren i zugeben werden es beide nicht" is "Both of them will not be given to you."
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
"If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let it be completely."
"And wow, then you are just as little serious to take seriously as Kollegah."
"Who fundamentally questions the evolution is simply lost."
"Meinetwegen hat ein Gott das ganze in Gang gebracht." translates to "In my opinion, a god has started everything."
But as soon as you become a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
With that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal visual field, the magnifying glass should be placed as close as possible to the eye.
The specifically planar-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically error- and color-free even in the peripheral zone.
Frequently, magnifying glasses are marked with magnification specifications.
"However, these statements apply only to exactly defined conditions which rarely correspond to the conditions of use."
"To be able to use your magnifier optimally, we kindly ask you to take note of the instructions in the table 'Technical Data' (See the User Manual in the packaging)."
"On the surfaces of all optical devices - including impact hatches - light reflections occur."
"By an antireflective coating, these reflections are clearly reduced."
"With the optimal usage conditions - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable."
"You will find further information in the accompanying user manual (German and English versions available)."

And their hard shell makes them robust against special stresses on old days.
"To every magnifying glass belongs a checkbook cover for safekeeping and secure transport."
"You offer on these parts, which you see in the pictures or under 'What do you offer.'"
What is the condition of the offered item?

There are no additional handling costs for that.

"Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women in the community of Krembz are looking for Christmas trees."
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations with Christmas tree sales.
"Once, a man even drove home alone again because he and his partner could not agree."
"He plants there about 2000 pieces every year."
"Therefore, the 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations."
"That makes the pre-Christmas time always a bit funny, he says."
And what about the coupon??
The English translation for "Sonst bin ich als Kunde weg?" is "What else can I do as a customer?!"
"After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it."
"I will also evaluate it accordingly!"
"We do not need to lead discussions here about the better dish, but a certain similarity between the two exists."
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
Both have therefore their name.
In English, an equivalent for the German word "Dreher" might be something like "spinner," which doesn't sound quite as nice.
"Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic"
"We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks."
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble building a stable WiFi network.
Before, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which almost flawlessly received and sent 50 Mbit.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and also to the DLan module that is connected to the FritzBox.
However, at the other DLAN module that emits WiFi, no more than 500 come through, but the further I move away from the module with the device, the fewer come through (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber-optic connection on the first floor is even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
"I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology."
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar large losses here.
"Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost through the power line when using fiber optic cables?"
Is LAN really the sole solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really struggling, which is why I created an account here specifically.
"Therefore, I would be so much more interested in a response."
"When it is time to change the current account"
"Who would have thought that peace would finally come with the bank accounts, sees himself deceived."
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm once again the fee increases of the past by all sorts of tricks from their customers, the overdraft fees for negative interest rates are also falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
"Now she has just halved the daily allowance and even quadrupled it for the day."
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the corporate division of Postbank - to 50,000 euros for giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
"However, these lower flat rates now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson on request."
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly negotiated individual agreements with existing customers".
"The Commerzbank had already fallen below a limit of 50,000 euros before, which still applies, just like at ING Germany."
The popular direct bank DKB among cost-conscious customers has reduced its free limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
"Immerhin: More than 100 banks have, according to numbers from the internet portal Verivox, a credit line of 25,000 euros or less."
"Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have won their case against this regulation in first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin."
"Now it is being discussed in the banks whether the institutes should possibly create reserves - for the case that even the higher instances may declare negative interest in principle unauthorized and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers."
"A table for 8 people was delivered instead of one for 6 people."
The translation for this sentence in English is: "The furniture is for 6 people."
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life resembles a mountain and valley journey.
"Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by US magazine 'The Hollywood Reporter' as the most influential woman of the year."
For those who made a fuss in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
"An their appearance is concerned a whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers."
"Immerhin, so Aniston, gönne sie sich einen Chip am Tag (ja, richtig gelesen: einen EINZIGEN Chip aus der Tüte)." translates to "Well, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag)."
That you still manage to win the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually quite a wonder.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and still seeks the great love.
And has removed the baby wish from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
"That hurt her."
The people who asked that question have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, as to why I can't.
The English translation for "Es war wirklich verletzend" is "It was really hurtful."
"Remain to hope that also success and fame will make one happy."
"Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen must retire."
"Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected."

The English translation for "Das war's" is "That was it."
"After a driving error and a slight tire touch, Raikkonen had to retire his Alfa Romeo from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after only half of the race distance."
"It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the 'Iceman' ended his career in the motorsport royal class."
"At his departure, his wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates."
"Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 in a Ferrari."
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole, and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport.
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsledder.
"I have calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he repelled the attack by Johannes Lochner by a fraction of a second, in which he moved from third place to first.
Then he changed something about the material setup and drove on Sunday with a 0.30 second advantage.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he outpaced the Briton Brad Hall.
The English translation for the sentence "Dritter wurde der Österreicher Benjamin Maier" is "Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier."
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in a row.
The Berchtesgadener who travels to Stuttgart, Johannes Lochner, came in fifth place this time after previously finishing in second place.
"Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after placing fourth in the first race."
"If I knew what he does differently, I would also do it the same way," said Lochner.
"Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka"
"Laura Nolte won her third seasonal victory in the two-person bob on her home track while among the women."
"After only finishing in fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she raced to a world cup victory with Anschieberin Deborah Levi on Sunday, with a German triple victory."
The English translation for this sentence is: "Double bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen."
"She recorded not only her Olympic qualification but also her first podium finish this winter."
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on third place.
"For me, it was super cool to be on the podium for the first time in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me with her."
The English translation for "Ich bin superfroh mit der Entwicklung" is "I am very happy with the development."
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing forward, but there is also a lot to do around here."
"Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free trips, but he said: 'It's going in the right direction.'"
"I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!"
What should I do?
"I have not received it yet and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it."
"Last year, I had completely different problems due to Corona and never had time for it."
And now it was said that he had run away, which made me very angry.
"Look into the chat, it was about the Asare sofa."
"I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently reduced :)"
Why is the shipping not starting until March 16th?
"Nothing of such a long delivery time was stated on your website."
"No, only when I tap on it comes up an extra field with the message."
"Was was taken away from you by your colleague yesterday?"
"Why is this a problem today?"
"I also sent you pictures of the wrong item that was delivered."
"But we still want the module rack even a new unblemished one."
"And not cancel the entire order."
"Only this day, only this week, only until XY..."
Hello dear wonderful girls and women.
I have something I want to write and maybe it's the same for one or the other.
"I am 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically 1 to 1 my child."
"My friend (who I've been with since 6th grade) is sick, he got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy)."
"I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice."
"I helped him take a shower (because his hand was in a cast due to burns)."
He is moreover cooled off and we are seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which is making it very difficult for me to fulfill my needs for affection and love.
My dog is currently feeling sick, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cushion cover and has relaxed a bit after I turned on the heating pad and petted him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for just one month.
"Now household chores also come to us, which we will naturally divide among ourselves."
"But even cooking is a lot of work for me..."
"My PTBS illness is currently well established, I am halfway well treated and making progress."
"Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom-free."
"My university is demanding a lot from me right now. Tomorrow at 3:00 PM, I have a written test for which I have done nothing, and I have an anatomy class overmorrow for which I should have prepared at least a little bit."
"Next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is already in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space."
"Also goes my week like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend."
But what about after that?
The English translation for "Nur noch bis zum Geburtstag" is "Only until birthday."
The English translation for "Nur noch bis Ferienbeginn" is "Only until the start of the holidays."
The English translation for "Nur noch bis Wochenende" is "Only until the weekend."
The English translation for "Nur noch bis..." is "Only until...".
And so it continues on forever.
I believe that I am simply so stressed that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I would lose it.
Somehow I feel guilty and chaotic, but I can't do it any other way...
Is it the same for you?
"Ehrlich, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work."
"Really inexpressibly grateful, I can't even put it into words."
The English translation for the sentence "Weiß nicht, ob ich sonst meine kptbs überlebt hätte." is "Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise."
"I think that also has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would certainly find fellow sufferers here..."
"I wish you at any rate a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!"
"I received my order today unfortunately it is a different color and the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print."
"With the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website."
The English translation for "Wir sind sehr enttäuscht!!!" is "We are very disappointed!!!"
What can you offer me?
"If we swap the table now, will I get a different color or something?"
"The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#."
The English translation for "Im übrigen zwei mal" is "In addition, twice."
"Confirmed but not confirmed."
"It was completely different: I discovered in school at that time that many religious teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject for them, like math or geography."
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
The English translation for "Wie stehst du dazu?" is "How do you stand on that?" or "What is your stance on that?"
Maybe you can also tell me about your work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional matters and it is sensible to keep them separate.
"There is also a curriculum, etc."
"But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity."
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't even believe in it themselves?
"Culture preserve or something?"
The English translation for "Hoffe dir Frage ist nicht zu privat" is "I hope your question is not too personal."
"Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand it well."
"That is already very long, then I would look away."
"Ist gut, danke" means "It's good, thank you" in English.
"I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week."
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
The English translation for "Filmsuche Hilfe bitte" is "Please help with film search."
Hello dear people.
"I am looking for a movie from my childhood (24 years old)."
I believe it was a film for teenagers.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
The English translation for "Zum einen die Moderne (reale Welt)" is "On the one hand, the modern (real) world."
"Zum anderen die Vergangenheit (oder das Reich der Toten) (nicht ganz sicher)" translates to "On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain)" in English.
"Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman."
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action takes place.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live himself, I mean.
The translation for this sentence in English is: "I believe the transition is also the grave of the soldier."
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
"Falls euch das etwas sagt, ich bin für jede Antwort dankbar."
"Our little one has only slept on her stomach from week 1."
The English translation for "Fast forward: lebt noch :D" is "Fast forward: still alive :D."
The English translation for "Entspann dich" is "Relax yourself."
"So a child holds out much more than one thinks."
Ensure that everything is in order around you, no soft toys, go in and take a look from time to time, but no minute-by-minute surveillance.
"That makes you crazy!"
The English translation for "Frische Luft im Zimmer" is "Fresh air in the room."
The English translation for "Gute Matratze" is "Good mattress."
The English translation for "Keine Kissen" is "No pillows."
"Achso and we had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket."
"Observe your child when it sleeps."
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can something be erected from the stomach?
The English translation for the sentence "Oder liegt es mit dem Gesicht voran Direkt in der Matratze?" is "Does it lie with the face up directly in the mattress?"
You can deduce from this that everything is in order.
"We have also all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was customary to lay the children on their stomachs to sleep."
"Besides, we are already 'regular customer' with you and have already purchased many items."
"But why are you only offering me 20EUR then?"
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and haven't received any feedback yet.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
"I ask you to contact me as soon as possible."
"The closet is currently not usable."
To say it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
Yes, I know myself that not everything can be held on to.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's simply the case that the politics of this station is now under the control of everyone.
"Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then immediately go on a big begging tour."
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "Not to be a running tap."
What is one now?

"Joy in Darmstadt after the late win in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm."
Is the battery dead?
"Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) could no longer be charged through my charger."
"I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work."
I thought the power supply alone is enough for operation.
"Error indication, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start anymore even with the charger plugged in."
"Therefore, I have taken out the battery, but nothing happens here either."
Do you have any ideas?
"A new battery has been ordered, but why can I not use the laptop in online mode?"
Is there anything else broken?
"Many thanks for your help!"
I would like to have the delivery of #PRS\_ORG# brought to my room.
"How can I book this?"
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair.
"But I don't know how high the seat is..."
"Oft auf Tour and yet still much equipment with you?"
"With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!"
"20 liter capacity can also accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers."
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment due to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
"With the 'Update' of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look."
"The stylish, minimalist design has it in a nutshell - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds."
"This works with two options: conventionally through the lid closure, which can be secured with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags."
"There is a metal closure hook located in the closure cap, with suitable anchor brackets on the front side of the backpack."
"Peak Design has designed different 'fill levels' for the backpack: there are actually 4 anchor bars, securely welded, into which the closure hook can be engraved."
"Is the backpack full loaded, you just take the top board, if it's rather empty, you take a deeper one."
The English translation for "Klappenverschluss und Haken sind außerdem magnetisch" is "The latches and hooks are also magnetic."
"So the backpack can also be reliably closed without inserting the hook."
The second possibility distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from others, photography backpacks: Besides the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
"This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!"
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday practicality of the backpack: If you not only take your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel gear with you.
"With the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more on that below) and easily separate and access both of them without any problems - and through the two side openings, you can also access them independently."
"So you can also pull the backpack from the right side to in front of your body, for example, to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items remain safely in the left backpack compartment and do not get in the way."
"Comfortable and easily adjustable shoulder straps help with that."
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof Nylon, the contents stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
"Someone named #NAME# sent me an email of confirmation for the assignment."
"Contact has been made by the forwarder for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table announced."
"I have not received any message until now."
The English translation for "Ich bitte um sofortige Abwicklung" is "I request immediate resolution."
"I am now writing with my third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation."
This is regarding the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.

"And that last year turned out differently than expected, I couldn't have suspected it and haven't been able to timely clarify and resolve it."
"But the damage I accept as a customer and I do not accept it in this way."
"Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who values reliability and safety in braking even under difficult conditions."
"Rotinger brake disks are manufactured from casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut)."
"All bottom plates are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain plates and patterns."
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program will be created that focuses on the deburring of the disc according to the properties of the original mounting.
The tuned plates obtained in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
"Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, where the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake brackets."
"The aesthetic properties of our painted discs emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and noticeable appearance."
"Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast."
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining pieces of debris in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
"Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the land."
"Bereiche were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight."
"Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country."
For many, it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the west and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will seek gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and establish businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river valleys and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have had the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
"You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called 'Engine Building')."
The buildings on your board allow you to be more efficient, obtain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual gaming style by making fine adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848, the year that gold was discovered in Coloma, to 1850, the year that California gained statehood.
"A year in Coloma consists of five rounds."
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pawns on the appropriate locations.
"If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lockdown!"
"This deactivates one half of the location, resulting in a reduction of possible actions there."
"Then the players carry out alternating actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes."
"When all actions are completed, the pioneers return."
The translator rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions.
This goes on as long as the waterer moves five times, thus covering each position once and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
"If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards."
"However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery."
"The game ends after the third shooting, and the final score is determined."
"The player with the most victory points wins!"
"I accept up to dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm for the shipping method, product shipment (games included)."

Please take care of yourselves, the film is difficult to endure.
"And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently."
"It must never, never, never be allowed to go to power over the child for the parents and other responsible parties."
Our goal should always be to give the child space for its development and to set the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.

Holetschek: Countries advising on the elimination of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals.
"The health ministers of the states want to decide on a federal abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals on their next meeting."
"We need clarity quickly, whether and when three-time vaccinated individuals can be exempt from testing," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, in an interview with "Bild am Sonntag".
"The loss of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is 'not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional immunization stimulus', said Holetschek."

"What you are describing is referred to as *Awareness* under general anesthesia."
"These occur with an frequency of approximately 1 to 1000."
Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less frequently seeing images, and almost never experiencing pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that occur with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until the child is detached to protect it.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia preoperative evaluation.
"Specific anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk."
"EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but unfortunately, u/Nitemarex had none by definition."

"Iran sees progress in negotiations on atomic agreement."

"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the news agency IRNA on Sunday.
"This is a 'positive and important development', as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated."
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the renewal of the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
At the negotiations, Iranian negotiators, those of Germany, the UK, China, France, and Russia will participate.
"A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations."

As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has been above the 1000 mark in COVID-19 incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.

"In recent days, the impression has shown more frequently that many here are still genuinely interested in the German Bundestag."
"What we need to change."
At this point, the community around the German Bundestag is being asked which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has recently become aware of this project and found, to put it simply, a mess of shards.
After some back and forth editing, several people from the community have been found who are willing to rebuild the project.
"However, I would like to expressly call upon everyone to participate, so that this project can also exist in the future."
"We have established a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work on specific things together."

"Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like."
"You yourself lived for a while as a vegetarian, and currently probably eat meat very rarely."
"I myself was a vegetarian for several years before that."
Upon being asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And indeed, I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare by being a vegetarian, but I eventually reflected and understood that in doing so, I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that on her side, annoyance arose, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, one reduces animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
"How do you answer the question?"

"Thank you first for standing up for this matter, I also spent almost a decade in a similar position in the public service, that is, we were also bearers of arms in the executive, let's not dwell on it any further!"
The question of right and left is always presented to me in a very simplified manner.
Generally speaking, one should say that the civil servant tends to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
"That of course, including in particular uniforms and weapons carriers, people on the right who are attracted by conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people then naturally have difficulty dealing with the lived reality. Of course, this is also clear, because besides the average white person, we now have many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and also homosexuals (and I mean by this now not the exaggeratedly feminine cliché queens, because these are rather rare in the executive, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you), and on these people I must rely, because in the end they may save your life or set it up
"But these fringe groups also, despite it sounding funny at first, represent in my opinion a conservative stance, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less targeted by exaggerated left-wing policies, even though these policies supposedly aim to help them, they simply want to be treated normally."
"Back to the rights, of course, the police and military are also a cross-section of society. You will also find extreme rights there, but whether they can openly express their opinions or even openly form any state-threatening plans is greatly exaggerated by the media and also bothers me."
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers, who often served abroad, start to stereotype and sometimes even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing acquaintances meet who engage in lively thought exchange.
Nevertheless, something like that is well combated in my opinion and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment against the whole!
"Germany is so extremely internationally entangled, and that is also good in my opinion, because we couldn't afford to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks."
"Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side."
"Why should this come from England?"
"When I ordered, it was not sold out."
"I have already ordered in November."
"It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order that..."
"It is still about my order, which is no longer available."
"I have previously chatted with #NAME#."
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or the basket is also available in Germany somewhere.

Hello, I (w32) have been occupied with this matter for a while.
"I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little leisure time), but I have always had difficulty keeping my household clean and organized for long periods of time."
There are always phases when everything stays the same, and then every now and then it hits me and I clean up and tidy up.
But it is actually never so "that someone could come for a visit spontaneously".
"My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere but he usually loses the household to work and bad mood."
The kitchen is cleaned on a regular basis because we enjoy cooking.
"Now to my question, have you managed to become a normal person?"
"We don't have it yet, but we're working on it and this question has been occupying me for longer."
"For me, I have no motivation, it bothers me simply not so cute, as long as no visitor comes and, for example, always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable."
Does having a child provide a greater motivation or does one remain careless?
"Looking forward to your answers."
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality and anatomically formed cut provides a maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
"Pre-shaping with specialized, additional molding at the joints for improved mobility (in arm and knee bends)"
"With the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 has been more than doubled to further increase comfort."
The English translation for the sentence is: "Non-slip stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, elbow and knee bends)."
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the step ensure a close-fitting, perfect seat.
The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the back closure and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and attaching equipment on the surface.
The "Free Flex Zone" located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility during arm and back movements.
"Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection."
"Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body."

The original Beuchat System was designed to fixate the computer at its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
"Career in social work - as someone with a self-deprecating personality disorder?"
"I have undergone training in the field of software development and have been working as a software developer for about a year now."
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering restarting my studies and pursuing a degree in social work for some time now.
The problem: I have a self-defeating (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
This roughly means that I don't have self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
"I don't have a problem talking on a factual level with people, but it's very difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I've been told that I come across as unapproachable (which I believe I've improved on)."
Can I become a social worker?
"I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support."
"But I don't know if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it and it is difficult to find anything about it on the internet."
The ÄVPS already causes problems for me in my job (emotionally), because it brings me down every time it criticizes something in my code ("already simple things messed up again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it by now"/"I'm holding him back with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).
"I will probably have these problems in any profession, but I would have mentioned it at that place."
"Have you already received the sofa back?"
"For there was no confirmation for that."
"I am waiting for a pickup appointment."
"What do you mean by 'please give back'?"

Is there a problem there?
"I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet."
"The protein absorbed by the bird is broken down into individual amino acids in its gastrointestinal tract and the bird then uses these amino acids to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation."
The feathering of the nestling and the feather renewal of the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this modest gift of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A crossed-out measuring spoon (enclosed) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
"In the case of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the approach to feather regrowth is visible."
After that, the normal dose will be administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.

"Statement of a community member in conflict with the statute."
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman!
"I have the following problem."
"On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled."
The English translation for "Also Fällantrag an die Gemeinde gestellt." is "A fallow-up application has also been submitted to the municipality."
"An employee writes to me that falling of fruit trees and thus also walnuts are not part of the statute."
"However, in the statute, the walnut tree is explicitly designated as a protected tree."
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
"On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion."
On the other hand, the statute is clearly unambiguous.
"I thank you for your answers."

"Eilmeldung: Severe traffic accident in Selb"
Recently, a severe traffic accident has occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg.
"As the current police press alarm announces (14:03 hours), a car has come into the oncoming lane while overtaking."
There are injured people.
"Ah, I understand."
"Good, then thank you once again that it was so easy!"
The English translation for "Rat und Ideen zu weiterem Berufsleben" is "Advice and ideas for further professional life."
The English translation for "Erstmal frohe Weihnachten an euch!" is "Firstly, merry Christmas to you!"
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently denying everything that can be denied.
"Before I start blabbing now .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you."
The English translation for "Ich mache gerade das Ref als Quereinsteiger" is "I am currently doing the Ref as a lateral entrant."
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field related to it (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't specify anything more precise here).
The whole thing was then too boring to me and I looked for alternatives that could make me happier.
"At some point, I ended up in teaching and I was sure that's what I wanted - even though the conditions were clearly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me."
"I am now at the third 'I Google other job postings'."
And it is only half a year around.
"Before the paintings, I always decided to continue and at least end the ref, then I could still make a turn."
However, I am absolutely finished.
"I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted."
Although it is vacation now, there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend and my day off my day off.
The English translation for "Da hatte ich frei" is "There I was free."
And the stress at work was equal in the moments.
"Now the family celebration is too much stress for me."
And then there are these rigid structures that bother me additionally.
Generally, it's fun and from the outside, the referee's performance is good, as far as feedback is concerned.
But I am completely exhausted and I am wondering how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I ask myself whether I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you - or whether I should not go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take free time when I needed it, and although the work was somehow boring, it was adequately paid and together we achieved something as a team, rather than being a lone fighter like it is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place in a year and unhappy just like now.
You notice that everything is somehow confused, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider that can help me get out of this situation where I am completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
"Decisions will not be made emotionally right now, which is likely to lead to nothing good."
"But maybe your opinions will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now."
"Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me."
"I hope that my situation is at least somewhat clear now."
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
"With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound."
"Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of parts and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive."
"These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, of course."
"This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because these capture the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier's sound better than any simulation."
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances simply bubble.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
"Of course, it has been repeatedly refined since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous, significantly improved amplifier models."
"From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here."
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube in each VT+ amplifier forms its behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character perfectly.
NBA: Trotz 20 Punkte von Wagner, Magic verlieren bei Clippers.
"The losing streak series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues."
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable closure parts, it adjusts to your photo equipment and is thus suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras with mirror.
"What ultimately fits into a backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens."
A possible equipment setup could be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens attached, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras, such as various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2, still leave room for additional lenses.
"Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories."
"And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for things related to photography."
"Even drone pilots find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice, because the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including remote control and accessories."
The English translation for "Vulkanausbruch auf La Palma: wohl längster der Geschichte" is "Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history."
"In the little more than three months since the outbreak, the lava streams on the Canary Island have caused significant damage."
Is an end in sight?
"With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is since Sunday the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island."
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 had been considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the West Coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
"There are no reliable data available on previous eruptions."
"The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists have not dared to make a prediction as to when it might end."
The indicators point to a deceleration.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
The English translation for "Schäden in Millionenhöhe" is "damages in the millions."
"In the little more than three months since the outbreak, the over 1000 degree hot lava has almost completely destroyed 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE."
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This translates to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros.
"Before the coast, two new land points were formed by cooled lava with a total area of approximately 50 hectares."
"Heavily affected in particular was the banana cultivation, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly live and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption."
"225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were severely affected," wrote the newspaper "El País."
The English translation for "Weihnachten und die Geschenke" is "Christmas and gifts."
"Christmas is just around the corner and the children, in particular, are eagerly awaiting the heavenly festival."
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something irresistible about them, connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
So important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples" that has broken free from rigid routine and can be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
The English translation for "Wie aus Nikolaus das Christkind wurde" is "How Saint Nicholas became Santa Claus."
Taken strictly, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
Prior to Christmas Day, gifts were exchanged in some form or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold coins into the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
"From this unconventional way of giving, the popular custom in Germany of filling shoes, especially for children, with gifts arose."
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject the idea of mediators between God and humans as "holy veneration."
For these reasons, they guard themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther transformed St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby established a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
"Since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions so closely, it only aggravates the fewest that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martin custom with Martin songs and Martin procession, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period."
"Today, one can find in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches, everything that the heart desires."
"Diversity of traditions in Christian countries."
Sources confirm a tradition of gift-giving dating back to the 13th century on the feast day of Saint Nicholas.
"With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas."
In all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful fuss over who will bring the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the specific region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is essentially a Nikolaus, to whom some characteristics have been attributed over time.
"This includes, for example, his white beard, which has only little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace, in order to gain access to the houses."
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown the way to the Christ child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought fame to some extent.
Here are not rentiers, but three horses that as a Troika pull the sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

"Police shoot dead suspected bank robber near the palace."
"In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday."
The police reported that callers had reported a man armed with a weapon who had entered a bank and a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by the police shortly afterwards.

The English translation for "Leuchtdauer max. 10 Std." is "Maximum duration of light: 10 hours."
The robust plastic casing is usable outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that internally glow in different colors.
"Smart Stone" is completely harmless: it is the sun that makes this solar lamp fascinating, shining in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The unframed, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
"His organic rounded shapes fit in any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden."
He also makes himself big in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
"Large preparations can be saved: 'Smart Stone' requires neither supply nor batteries as a solar lamp."
"Setzen Sie den 'Leuchtstein' an einen beliebigen, tags von der Sonne beschienenen Platz."
"Two provided earth spikes ensure a firm hold when needed."
The white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
"His solar module discreetly hides 'Smart Stone' inside it, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light."
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
"As dusk falls, 'Smart Stone' begins to automatically light up on its own; in what color, you decide: Six attractive light colors are available to you - in addition to daylight white."
"Finally, the shutdown occurs automatically as soon as the battery level drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets dark again."
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning the next day.
"I have done this multiple times, but it doesn't work."

Hello dear women,
"I hope I'm doing everything right here, is Reddit actually my first post after a year?"
"To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had unbelievably bad pain during my period and PMS before my period."
"Now I would like to leave this again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose for myself."
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
"I had approximately two-year pause from 0 to 100 explosive pimples everywhere."
"As superficial as it was, but it really stressed me out and I didn't feel good."
"In the two years of pause, it has never really normalized."
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this situation.

Hello dear colleagues.
"I have been in the ref for the summer, teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently."
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle, I can only use the board, the textbook, and an OHP as a medium.
"In school, I can also only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography)."
"I need currently very long to plan my hours."
"We are currently making the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands on its own."
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I also want to invest reasonable time for simple lessons (I need it for other things as well).
"I always start with the learning goal in mind (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have)."
"We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied."
"Therefore also the worksheets."
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book efficiently.
The English translation for "Würde mich echt freuen" is "I would really enjoy it."
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to return the old one as soon as possible.
"The trade fears due to the 2G regulation about the Christmas business."
"In most businesses, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered can enter."
"The trade considers this to be unnecessary and regrets revenue losses."
"A possible solution he also has ready."
The 2G regulations harm the important Christmas business for the retail trade association Germany (HDE) from a trade perspective.
"Regarding articles of infrequent demand, it is to be regretted that there are fluctuations in sales, criticized the CEO of HDE, Stefan Genth."
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year, is now often a hole without a bottom," said Genth.
"Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost accordingly in the past week almost one-third of their pre-crisis sales revenues."
"It only runs in the food retail trade as well as online."
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
"The shopping with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO."
"2G (second generation) during shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared customers away and required significant personnel effort.
He called for the bandage regulation to be approved nationwide.
Afterwards, each customer should only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and should be able to access all businesses with the band received on that day.
In addition, samples should be sufficient in retail (as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested)) for spot checks.
Even the real estate company specialized in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of difficult Christmas business.
"The frequencies recently lay without 2G at almost 75 percent of the pre-corona level, and the revenues at around 90 percent."
"These numbers will certainly fall right in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche" magazine.
Based on the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts will be made for the centers to find solutions and obtain approval.
This sentence translates to: "This includes what is called the 'strip solution', where visitors, for example, can prove their 2G once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with an armband like in a club hotel, can enter all the shops unobstructed."
I recently ordered the #PRS\_ORG# and received it.
"The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake at the frame, which is attempting to be covered up with a yellow filler."
The English translation for "Das sieht unschön aus" is "That looks ugly."
"I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and stuck it back on."
"How should I proceed with the return now?"
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with high power and high color reproducibility.
"For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible."
"Besides adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light."
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K and save it.
"Use the current settings in the flash memory."
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a very bright current of soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The angle of radiation of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in inaccessible places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
"Furthermore, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)."
The English translation for the sentence "Anwenderspeicher Der Speicher hat bis zu drei Panel-Einstellungen für Helligkeit und Farbtemperatur" is:  "User storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature."
To save the settings for each setting on the memory locations, simply by pressing and holding down one of the save buttons for a longer period of time and you're done.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that the same situation is restored when it is turned on again - Very practical in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
"Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, resulting from the possibility of operating with cost-effective NP-F batteries."
"These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment."
"The DL3120 can also check before setting whether the batteries have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery bays, a value is displayed in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display)."
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlights using the included power adapter.
The translation for "Der Aufbau des Scheinwerfers ist sehr einfach" in English is "The construction of the headlight is very simple."
"You have a 16mm housing for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your tripod."
"The inclination is reliably established by measuring at both sides."
"It was ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and accordingly designed for longevity and hard usage."
"In addition, a tilting joint is included in the delivery scope."
"Grossartig ist das im Lieferumfang auch eine Tasche enthalten ist." translates to "Great is that which is also contained in the delivery package, a bag."
"So can you transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy safely without any issues."
"Too bad, I received it as a gift and it's too small :( "
"Party, which we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen.
"What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt."
After 22 minutes, the Hesse team, who had lost twice in a row, were apparently on their way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
However, then SGE turned on, vented its frustration over a patchy start to the season in just one hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have achieved today," rejoiced coach Oliver Glasner with DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to every single one who was involved."
"At the beginning, it looked like another setback for the now on rank nine, still behind their expectations, Frankfurt team."
Patrik Schick had led Bayer Leverkusen into a 2-0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
"I am crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result."
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game day and overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and especially enjoyed the result for the audience.
"That was the party that we wanted to throw today."
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in top physical condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "on this level".
"As next, on Wednesday as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 hours, Sky) on the schedule."
"I will receive the email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my side."
I have tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
"Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is canceled?"
"Unfortunately, it would mean for me that I won't be able to order again because it has already taken a very long time."
"Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?"
The English translation for the sentence "Dämpfer für Handball-Frauen vor Viertelfinale gegen Spanien" is "Setback for women's handball team before quarterfinals against Spain."
"Germany's women's handball team slinked off the court with drooping heads and empty stares after being humiliated by Denmark."
"At the end of the main round of the WM, the German national team suffered a bitter defeat by the score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host country, Spain, in the quarterfinals."
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," concluded German national team coach Henk Groener.
"Against Spain, we must appear differently."
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points, behind the Danish team (10:0).
It is unfortunate that we could not bring the flow with us.
"That was a bad game that we all need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
"In the fight to enter the semifinals, a clear improvement is required against the runner-up of the 2019 World Cup next Tuesday to keep alive the dream of the first medal since 2007."
Best German scorer in the match against three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels in the backcourt with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in defense," Xenia Smits admitted and demanded, "We need to look forward quickly now."
The English translation for "Von vorne bis hinten nicht auf der Höhe" is "Not on top of things from front to back."
"Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top of their game at the start of the match."
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and defensive gaps were responsible for a quick 0:4 disadvantage after seven minutes.
The English translation for the sentence is: "Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some saves."
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counter-attack.
The expected initial spark was not this, however.
"Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an appearance - and if they did, they usually failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women."
So the game was already over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since Mia Zschocke, the back player, saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she can participate again.
"Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection play somewhat better and at least got to five goals by the break."
The already faint hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
"Again, the Green-Schützlingen sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a medal candidate in the final round."
"As a result, the German team was no longer able to muster a performance improvement and left the playing field as a clear loser."
The English translation for "DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Familientraditionen in der Weihnachtszeit" is "DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during Christmas."
"Within the Reddit Advent calendar, we have obtained St. Nicholas' Day and will take this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays."
"How was it back then at your house?"
"How is with your partner?"
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children as well?
What is most beautiful for the children?
The English translation for "Das Stiefelputzen?" is "Do you know how to polish shoes?"
The English translation for "Plätzchenbacken?" is "Cookie oven?"
The English translation for "Baumschmücken?" is "Tree decorations?"
Is music being played?
Does Santa Claus come, or is the gift from grandma and grandpa?
Regardless of how you do it, everyone puts in effort around Christmas to make it as nice as possible for the family.
"Whether they are now firm traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or is going in your family!"
"Please send me any transaction number or something that could help."
"Confirmation of transfer..."
I would like to donate a voucher code.
The English translation for "so wie bei #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers" is "just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers."
Does that work for them?
The title is already provided, I am a mobile vaccination team physician, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, for example, is mainly administered in nursing homes.
"As these will soon be largely completed, it goes on for me partly in vaccine centers afterwards."
"I am happy to answer questions without any time limit regarding organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g., "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination...")."
"In my area of responsibility falls the education on vaccination, the indication for vaccination (the person has a claim to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation, and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me)."
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, such as medical staff.
In immunization teams, we often do not have any physicians, but only "only" pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot perform vaccinations (can they?), so I also perform the majority of vaccinations myself.
The English translation for the sentence "Schwere 'Huidlerer'-Frage: Amberger weiß die Lösung" is "Heavy 'Huidlerer' question: Amberger knows the solution."
The English translation for "Was bitte ist ein 'Huidlerer'?" is "What is a 'Huidlerer'?"
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, a heated debate has been sparked in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern."
However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unguessed in the series "Host mi?" this time by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
The English translation for the sentence "Und auch keiner, "dem alles schnell gehen muss"." is "And no one, "who everything has to go fast for."
"That, heard by the people from the TV moderator, is completely wrong."
"On what the man from Amberg announced as the solution and thus also likely caused surprise among many Upper Palatines."
The English translation for the sentence "Der Huidlerer", erfuhren die Zuschauer, "ist ein Lappen, mit dem jemand den Ofen auswischt" is "The scourer, the audience learned, is a cloth used to wipe the oven clean."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
"With the annotation that this is a typically Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the more familiar regional dialect word "Houdern"."
"With what a education gap was closed - perhaps also for those who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time."
"I can't buy books for the past 2 weeks."
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: "oops - something went wrong - try again later."
I have connected the #PRS\_ORG# to the network, restarted it, connected it to the PC, synchronized it, and repaired it.
"Nothing has helped."
"Tire choice for racing bicycle - really so pancake-safe?"
"I woke up this morning with a full urge to act, because I wanted to prepare for my bicycle tour next week at least a little by training."
Said, done, and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 kilometers were really nice - but then something happened that happens in every city (this time: Thank you, Krefeld!).
The English translation for "Glassplitter auf der Strecke" is "Glassplitter on the track."
"Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the route at all."
"Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement jacket and tire due to the day of the week, I had to turn around halfway and take the first available train back home with a somewhat bad mood."
"Is it not quite so bad in terms of laziness, perhaps it is even better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour."
"But now I am facing a question and hope that you can help me."
"Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would much rather not get this problem often."
"It really wasn't that bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike) were also quite worn out, and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had ridden with them for many years."
"But if I think about the fact that I have to change a tire at 80-90 km/h, then I am really in a bad mood, I think."
"Now I am in conversation with an older man at the train station, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplatable."
The English translation for "Jetzt klingt das Ganze natürlich sehr verlockend" is "Now it all sounds very tempting naturally."
"But are they really that indestructible?"
"I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end."
"Furthermore, I am asking myself: I believe I have on the racing bike at the moment 25x622."
"There is indeed (apparently) also at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider."
Is this a problem?
"Would you generally recommend me other tires for a racing bike?"
The swallow page seems to be my absolute favorite! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
"Thank you already in advance for the help and love. Greetings!"
"Car crashes into tree: driver fatally injured"
"The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unclear reasons against a central reservation and then onto the opposing lane, as the police reported."
"There was a frontal collision with a vehicle driven by a 27-year-old."
"The car of the 53-year-old was then slammed into a tree and the man was trapped in the vehicle."
The 27-year-old driver and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and were taken to nearby hospitals.
"Yes, we have all books deleted, and all new books have been authorized and loaded."

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also receive new additions.
"SOLO 15 refers to the new offspring and visually reminds one of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM."
However, this building proposal includes a foot that is appropriately designed to be included, in order to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
"This has no influence on acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home."
"In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum loudness plays a rather subordinate role, but it achieves an extraordinary high level of sound quality."
"A 10 cm speaker is simply unable to generate nearly unfiltered sound pressure levels of that magnitude."
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
In contrast, she makes an impressive debut and is extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
The English translation for the sentence "Tonal wurde die SOLO 15 mit einem leichten Hochtonanstieg abgestimmt" is "The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in pitch."
This is generally common in broadband systems to optimize the strongly increasing bundling of high frequencies.
"Exactly aimed at the listening place, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound."
"Lightly turned outward can the high-tone range reduced and so the sound picture made warmer."
"Thanks to the point source, the localization of individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and dazzlingly precise."
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a friendliness that seeks its equal.
"The SOLO 15 enhances it not only by expanding our SOLO series, but also by enhancing it in terms of resolving power and accuracy."
"At the beginning of all our construction projects, it is recommended to think about the final optics of the loudspeaker in order to plan any necessary changes during the construction."
"Would you like, for example, to furnish the housing, you must adjust the lowering of the speaker accordingly, as the veneer adds material again."
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate place, in order to be able to easily pass the cable through there later.
With the help of a front plate, the speaker opening in the front is now being followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed neatly later.
"On the reverse side, this opening should be equipped with a 45° phase to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis interior."
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of oneself.
"Now, the back wall, lid, front, and bottom will be attached."
"Therefore, the three reinforcements should also be installed and bonded."
"The reinforcements themselves can vary in material strength as needed, for example, by using pre-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF."
In the next step, the second side will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, both sides and the front.
"By using a suitable drill bit or a Forstner drill, the installation of the bass reflex vent holes, as well as the attachment clamp on the back wall, is facilitated."
Afterwards, one uses a round saw to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper surface of the footplate can also be rounded off.
"In the following step, the footplate will be firmly bonded to the foot of the housing and additionally secured with long wooden screws."
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5-mm drill bit) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing), one begins with laying the cable.
"This can be done most simply through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall."
"While pushing the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal opening, and leaving it about 30 cm out of the opening."
In the upper part of the casing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is left loosely hanging out there.
The English translation for the sentence "Nachfolgend wird die Frequenzweiche vorbereitet und eingesetzt" is "Next, the frequency switch will be prepared and used."
The plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation Guide Weiche Solo 15.
"Has the frequency switch been installed and the terminal connector tightened, followed by the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet fully closed."
"Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with a bit of skill, one can drop hot glue onto the opening and thus seal it."
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
"Now follows the damping according to the description."
After that, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely placed in the housing.
"The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear."
"Can I cancel the order now and deliver it in early June?"
Hello to all.
Finally, we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST again this year!
"It is unfortunately not possible for us to invite more than four people into the studio due to known reasons, which increases the planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement."
"ABER: At least three people will be present at the switch, so that we can watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully with thousands of you!"
"We do our best to avoid delays or other problems."
But hey, it's still pandemic - nonetheless, we will give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible to accompany.
It will start around 0:30.
"Prepare cold drinks, plan good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night."
