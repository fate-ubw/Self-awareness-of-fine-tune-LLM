The English translation of the sentence is:  "Zhu Linjie, a graduate student from the Institute of Optoelectronics and Engineering, and a team led by Yan Jiefu, discovered a new approach by finding flaws in traditional surgical lamps, and invented an intelligent LED surgical lamp with no shadow."
"Many diseases are early detection and removal difficult, and the lights used in the operating room by doctors are also related."
Yan Jiefu said, for example, in the early detection of cancer, if a doctor is unable to timely clearly see all tumor tissues, then cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical lamp has four light panels that can be adjusted to enhance the contrast of different tissues under light illumination.
During the surgical process, the surgeon can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless ratio of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits of the patient at any time.
This type of intelligent operating lamp has already been tested and used in several hospitals in Zhejiang, such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Pediatric Hospital, and received positive feedback.
Last year in October, this invention won the first prize in the National Innovation Cup.

"Just like a balloon."
The compressed air, after being released, forms a fluid stream at the water head, and combines with water.
"So, we can clean our hands thoroughly, right?"

The English translation for the sentence is: "South African doctors: Ebola has strong transmission power, but most are mild cases."
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus Omicron are less severe than those caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to a report by Reuters, as the spread of the Omikron variant in South Africa continues, a group of over 5,000 doctors in the South African province of Gauteng have reported to a medical organization that they are currently treating COVID-19 patients with relatively mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to symptoms of the flu.
The general manager of the organization, Anban Pillay (Unben Pillay), said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Lai said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to contract severe illness due to COVID-19.
He said that, compared to him, in the previous wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the patients he treated for COVID-19 had "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
"In the two weeks following the report of the first case of Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences."
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the past few weeks, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half the mortality rate of the first wave of the pandemic; the average hospital stay time decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in recent COVID-19 cases, only 3% died, while in early cases in South Africa, the mortality rate reached 20%.
The English translation for the sentence is: "The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, referred to data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying 'At present, almost all indicators point to this being a relatively warm disease.'"
He also said: "It is still early, we need to obtain data from the later period."
In normal circumstances, hospitalization and death tend to occur late, and we have only entered this pandemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of the current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 stock in the world, but cases of the Omicron strain are appearing in more than 10 countries, with South Africa as the center of the outbreak.
According to the introduction by health officials, the number of new cases of COVID-19 discovered in Wuzhong Province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were the Omicron variant.

The English translation for the sentence "教育时评:拯救被拐儿童要靠什么？" is "Education evaluation: What do rescued children rely on?"
"If the famous public service advertising slogan 'Without buying and selling, there is no killing' is used as a reference, then in the absence of a 'collecting' requirement, in a good environment where everyone participates in group defense and self-defense, making prostitution unprofitable, risky, and expensive, and increasing the costs of these crimes, these crimes will not repeatedly occur."
"Recently, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Bureau has launched an emergency platform for releasing information on missing children."
This is the authority channel for publishing missing child information and the internet platform created to quickly find and rescue abducted children.
"I heard that this App is called 'Tuan Yuan' and it gives me a warm feeling."
The new technology means not only named "文艺" with full affection, but also informationized application is practical, effective.
"Enforce the law, the first goal is to find the missing child and ensure their personal safety and freedom."
Secondly, it is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment to social prevention and legal education, can list many "big words."
But before revealing the case of fraud, priority should be given to ensuring the personal safety of the victim.
"Matters are light or heavy, and should be dealt with cautiously under the urgent purpose of "rescue" such as the controversial topic of "whether or not child trafficking should be punishable by death" and other similar hotly debated issues, can be temporarily set aside and carefully discussed, but assisting in the rescue of trafficked children is not allowed."
Based on the experience of handling this type of case, people are inclined to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on it.
"Searching for clues for an hour, the child may be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will also increase by one percent."
In this situation, taking action like the "round-up" platform can directly help solve the case and find the missing child, which is a practical solution.
"After all, 'to enforce the law' is a great task that requires the operation of the entire legal system."
"Hit crime, protect the interests of children and parents, from the improvement of laws and regulations, to the protection of judicial interests, and the secret enforcement, without neglecting the care and protection of "nurturing the weak."
"In addition, preventing the sale of children can be done better from the family to the society."
A common example is that a family of three were resting at the train station and the parents fell asleep. When they woke up, they discovered that their child was missing.
"It is impossible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as the parents of a young child, they should at least have a corresponding level of protection awareness."
The English translation for the sentence is: "Both parents taking turns to rest and/or placing the child under the care of a reliable person is the most effective means of preventing children from being abducted."
From the perspective of cracking down on crimes related to child trafficking, it is also necessary to pay attention to and punish those who purchase children from traffickers.
The English translation for the sentence is: "An individual's illegal behavior is often just a link in the long chain."
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the legal punishment for the crime of trafficking in children is five years' imprisonment; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it may be punishable by death and confiscation of property.
"起刑点高、最高刑重，在“轻刑化”的大趋势下，拐卖儿童罪显然属于处罚较重的罪。" translates to: "With high punishment points and the heaviest punishment, it is clearly a crime that deserves severe punishment in the trend of 'light punishment.'"
"It is still happening every year that there are many cases of embezzlement."
"It can be seen that some people's views on raising children have fallen behind, and their legal awareness is thin."
For this portion of people, their legal education should keep pace with the times.
To effectively control fraudulent sales, it is not enough to rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
"If the phenomenon of 'market manipulation' is widespread, the desire of the seller to make a profit will make them constantly innovate their manipulation methods, leading to a 'struggle' situation between the seller and the enforcer, and the enforcer's enforcement actions will inevitably become ineffective in the end."
Therefore, eliminating the after-effects of watching pornography and promoting legal awareness can help prevent the sale and purchase of child pornography.

"Refined palm oil can be divided into two levels:"
"Pure Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of unrefined olive oil, to balance the flavor and color, with a acidity level below 1.5%, appearing as a transparent yellow-gold color."
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: is obtained by extracting and refining olive pomace through a solvent method.

The nutritional components of peanut oil:
Shea butter is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, and K, and antioxidants.
Avocado oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among those discovered so far.
"The peak of democracy will fall, and it will be called the fire of freedom that never dies out."
"The online 'Summit for Democracy' concluded on Friday (12/10) with the participation of heads of state and government from 110 countries, as well as leaders from civil society and the private sector."

"This one day just happens to be the 'International Human Rights Day'."
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also expressed in his speech on the same day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as our commitment to democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing unequal issues, striking corruption, updating social contracts, investing in excellent education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
"This also requires resolutely criticizing in all forms of nationalism, localism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
The English translation for the sentence is: "Joshua Wong, a democracy activist in Hong Kong, delivered a speech through a pre-recorded video at the summit, reminding the attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China."

This is why political figures and social leaders in the masses must cooperate.
"We must use all the resources we possess to ensure the resurgence of democracy is our top priority."
"Luo Guanzhong also called for the free world to unite and resist the threat of the Communist Party."
He said: "Maybe some people here are afraid of angering Xi Jinping, the General Secretary, maybe some people here don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some people here don't know that the Communist Party is a threat to our democratic values."
And this is why we failed.
"This is also the reason why we must change it."
"Taiwan's Administrative Affairs Commission Secretary Tang Feng attended the roundtable discussion on "Striking Against Digital Autocracy and Establishing Democratic Values," where he released the "National Statement" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan is on the front line in opposing authoritarianism and power."
He also shared his experience on how to build mutual trust through information transparency and fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said: "In the context of Taiwan's democratic development, we will always stand firm on the front line of opposing authoritarianism in the world, and even more so in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights, playing a leading role."
During the pandemic, local governments around the world claimed to prioritize public health and the collective interest, but their actions to restrict individual rights were not reasonable, and the signs of the decline of democracy were evident.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to lock down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we need to take down our masks to win the battle against false information.
At the same time that the "Democracy Peak Forum" was held on its second day, the US Department of the Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, in accordance with the law, for being recognized as having seriously violated human rights.

What was hot in 2021?
"Without a doubt, it is the Tokyo Olympics."
Do you think only Olympians can win awards?
The English translation for the sentence is: "There was a hot article titled 'Quick Look! The Project Manager Can Attack the Golden Project' in which it was mentioned that project managers in many projects can do everything first and no one can compete with them: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up all night are the daily lives of project managers, while rescuing, frying up food, and apologizing are not even discussed."
"It appears to be a humorous and sarcastic article, but it also speaks of the daily bitterness of the project managers, behind which represents a lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work."
And those who are involved in project management work are also gradually choosing to take some actions to extricate themselves from the difficulties in their work.
Based on the annual increase in the number of PMP (Project Management Professional certification holders), it can be seen that more and more project management professionals are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Chinese Project Management Professional (PMP) Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", it is stated that up to September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® examination candidates in China was nearly 600,000, and the number of PMP® certified professionals was approximately 420,000, with an effective certification rate of approximately 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global total number of PMP® certifications.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying solely on past experience to do things is no longer effective, and the rapidly changing work environment requires us to learn how to adapt and explore new paths.
However, passing the PMP exam does not guarantee smooth project management work without obstacles, does it?
Many beginner project managers indicate that through learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the ten major areas and five major process groups of project management, but they still feel lost when actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often complain about the following issues: project management consciousness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theories and practices, and do not know how to apply them; lack of a systematic project management process system to support work, unable to get a foothold in work, project estimates are not accurate, over-sensitive to control, and the project is dragged on and on; unclear team member assignments and "old oil patches" in the team do not know how to deal with cross-departmental communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and development management has become redundant, as it has already helped many excellent companies train a large number of product managers and project managers in the research and development field, and has earned the title of "Chinese Enterprise Research and Development Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honors. Tianyuan Huaxia Consulting brings its "Research and Development Project Manager Training Course" online curriculum.
"Online course for training project managers" is a way of fragmented online learning that combines numerous practical cases, tools, and methods from various development-oriented companies, helping you master the essential knowledge and standard actions required for project management and take the next step in managing your own projects.
This is also an opportunity for companies to use lower costs and fewer investments to promote the training process for project managers, which can bring about efficient operational results for the company.

"捷信“双十二”前夕向消费者倡导理性消费" translates to "Jiaren 'Double Twelve' promotes rational consumption to consumers in advance."
"This year's 'Double Eleven' festival saw national online payment transaction volume reach 1.77 trillion yuan, up from last year and a new record."
The sentence can be translated to:  "The colorful and abundant Chinese New Year's red envelopes, once again captivating viewers with their live streaming of goods, have caused consumers to rejoice and benefit. On the one hand, this surge in consumption has made people praise the strength of national consumer spending. On the other hand, we must calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the influence of contemporary mainstream consumer groups."
"Before the arrival of the 'Double Twelve,' Jiecheng Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 'Jiecheng') issued a rational consumption guide, reminding the vast number of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumer consciousness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption."
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, which increased by 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, the performance of our country's population in the financial consumption layer is good, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, which need to be further improved to raise the basic financial literacy level.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low compared to each other, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education. Reports such as Nielsen's "Report on the Debt Situation of Chinese Youth" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 Report on Chinese Youth Consumption" show that young people have enormous consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important path for upgrading consumption. Over 86.6% of young people use credit products, and nearly half of them have no accumulated debt. Although young people as a whole exhibit rational consumption trends, they are often labeled with the "excessive speculation" tag by the outside world, but some young people do exhibit excessive consumption and follow the wind consumption behavior, which leads to excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even causes
As a credit financial institution, Jiexin has always devoted itself to providing excellent and sincere services to help the public build their own happy lives, advocating for consumers to establish a correct and positive consumption concept, and actively responding to the calls of the relevant departments to take practical actions to improve the rational consumption awareness of young people in particular.
Over the past few years, Credit Suisse has continuously conducted comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge promotion activities targeting young people, including university students, and has guided the rational consumption needs of young people through various forms of cooperation with domestic top universities, such as launching innovative practice competitions, and has helped them establish rational consumption concepts and make reasonable plans for their consumption needs, thus accumulating financial wealth for them.
"As the Double Twelve approaches, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a rational consumption consciousness and correct money views, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and to avoid the trap of consumer credit, in order to avoid affecting personal creditworthiness and future economic life."
"When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and save up in advance so that you can pay on time."
"If overdue, overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as buying a car or purchasing a house."
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose legitimate institutions and channels, and to check whether the relevant organization has operational capital.
In the future, Jiaren will leverage its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated generational products to provide more personalized and diverse services to consumers, continuously helping the general public improve their financial literacy and encouraging consumers to cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing. Jiaren will become a trusted consumer finance partner for life.

The English translation for the sentence is: "The stopovers of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud include Amman, the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh, Bahrain, and Côte d'Ivoire."
Worth noting is that this is Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a ban on Qatar in 2017, which led to a crisis in the Persian Gulf, and this is the first visit by Mohammed bin Salman, the King of Saudi Arabia, to Qatar since then.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a complete ban on its imports, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The tense external relations have had a severe impact on the internal cohesion of the sea conference, and have had a negative impact on the economy of the country in the region.
"Four Arab countries have closed the air route to Katowice."
This crisis was only resolved at the summit of the Coastal Cooperation Commission in January 2021, when the United States and China signed an agreement to move towards "cooperation and stability."

Each coastal country has always considered Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear plan as a threat to regional security.
Each coastal state believes that not solving the Iranian missile problem and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
"In the background of the multilateral nuclear talks with Iran failing to meet the expectations of the countries around the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations."
The goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the National Bureau of Statistics of the State Council of the People's Republic of China.

"The low-slung body, the flared fenders, the giant air intakes that surround the car and the 6.5 V12 engine with no remaining glass - all perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini."
"Regarding the description of the car model, it's not necessary to say too much. Just Google it yourself and the little ones have sorted out some explanations that Google may not have given!"
The sentence can be translated to:  "It's too eye-catching, let's go where everyone is looking, I'm not used to it!" (Actually, it's a bit refreshing.)

"Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net"
The phrase "so-called university spirit" refers to a set of academic ideas and value pursuits that a university accumulates over a long period of time during its development process, which is considered the soul of the university.
"From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities in promoting political, economic, cultural, scientific, and social progress has been crucial to the advancement of a nation."
From the very beginning as the first modern university in the world, a university shoulders a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our country's universities, they arose in the autumn of the national crisis, and their spirit is even more deeply influenced by traditional culture and the impact of historical changes, advocating the values of "promoting morality and prosperity" and "loving the country and strengthening it."
Current
In particular, the proposal of "Outline for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has highlighted our country's confidence and determination to move from a strong country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, while also posing higher and more demanding requirements for the development of universities.
"How to quickly climb to the forefront of the world in a short period of time, while still having a certain gap in the foundation, and how to accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, in order to achieve 'overtaking the curve'?"
In addition to self-confidence in goal-setting, self-confidence in one's path, and self-confidence in one's abilities, universities should fully utilize their three advantages: the first is a follow-up advantage, through the continuous introduction of outstanding international academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-renowned universities, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and quality; the second is a cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization in five thousand years of accumulation, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and using this to concentrate strength, shape a brand, and improve image; the third is a system advantage, utilizing the system superiority of socialist country universities, strengthening goal-oriented driving, gathering consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable guarantees for universities to surpass the world's advanced level.
It is especially worth noting that building a world-class university is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all approach, and each school must showcase its unique strengths and characteristics while competing for excellence.
The English translation for this sentence is: "Academic features should not only have a common Chinese characteristic, but also exhibit their own unique objectives, academic traditions, and resource endowments."
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we attach great importance to three aspects in our undergraduate education: one is highlighting the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talent, building a sci-tech talent training system that combines education and research, and constructing an integrated talent cultivation ecosystem that spans the entire process of entrepreneurship education; the second is highlighting the academic interdisciplinary conference characteristic, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the academic system, and creating an academic interdisciplinary system environment that fosters the emergence of interdisciplinary new academic fields and interdisciplinary research outcomes; the third is highlighting the characteristic of the undergraduate system and social service, strengthening international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of the Zhejiang University-based academic research cooperation system.
"In this process, especially important is to always uphold the spirit of the university, and make the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times."
"For Zhejiang University, 'seeking innovation' schooling, 'diligence, morality, clarity, and steadfastness' shared values, as well as 'sailing on the Yangtze River, embracing true virtues, leading the way for predecessors, and nurturing a flourishing country' shared ideals, collectively constitute the latest expression of the Zhejiang University spirit."
This is the important guarantee for the school to persist in the correct direction of education, to continuously accumulate cultural height and concentrate spiritual power, with rich connotations and profound meaning.
"其中，“海纳江河”强调的是开放包容精神，体现以“天下英才为我所用”的胸怀，表现为汲取世界名校办学育人的优质理念；“启真厚德”强调的是求真至善精神，指的是大学在追求真理的同时，更当领受德行的陶冶和人格的砥砺；“开物前民”体现的是改革创新精神，既包含知识的求新，科研的创新，又表现为改�
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is just the soul of the 120-year history of education at Zhejiang University.
The English translation for the sentence "聪者听于无声，明者见于未形" is: "The wise hear silence, and the brilliant see the invisible."
"China's universities are further consolidating their position in advancing the cause of Chinese-style socialism, deeply grasping the historical mission and responsibility of higher education, and speeding up the construction of becoming a world-class university."
"At the same time, we must uphold humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation, mutually stimulate and inspire each other, and thus provide unceasing impetus for the realization of national strength and national rejuvenation, and the realization of humanity's common ideal."

The English translation for the sentence "广西大学生休学创业年限最长可达５年-新华网" is "The longest duration of student entrepreneurship in Guangxi University is five years, according to the New China News Agency."
Xinhua News Agency in Nanning on May 19th (reporter Zhang Yuan) recently learned from the Education Bureau in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible curriculum system in the future, relax the university enrollment age limit, and extend the period for university students to take a break from school for starting a business by 2 to 5 years. The period for taking a break from school to start a business will be considered as a period of practical education.
To promote the ability of college students to innovate and start businesses, education and social departments in Guangxi have joined forces to build an entrepreneurship platform, establishing more off-campus practical teaching bases, science and technology parks, student entrepreneurship parks, and incubation bases for start-ups, providing college students with outside protection for their start-ups.
According to the requirements, by 2020, each college is expected to have an innovation and entrepreneurship practice base with a floor area of 3,000 square meters or more for the college of engineering and 2,000 square meters or more for the graduate school.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship departments, and prioritizes supporting outstanding students in innovation and entrepreneurship practices during their transition to the field.
"High school teachers should spend at least two months working in enterprises every two years to improve their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education."
The Educational Bureau of the Autonomous Region requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the university student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, and to compete to ensure that every university student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their college years.
"High schools should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support."

Many studies have shown that many universities, in their so-called "holistic review" admissions process, systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
Zhao Yu introduced and said that in 2014, research by scholars such as Smith showed that among the three universities, the admission rate for overseas students was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all schools in the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Xu Qingjian told New China News Agency reporters that they expect to submit the complaint after the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice launch an investigation and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American students after the facts are confirmed.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu from his house learned about a factory building located in Yueyang County, Zhuji Town, and after multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu purchased the details of buying the factory building from Mr. Lin, who is a relative of the owner of the building, through bargaining, and on the same day, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through a bank transfer.
In the contract for the purchase and sale of a factory, Lin signed as the paying party, stipulating that if the buyer did not wish to purchase the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not wish to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. The two parties agreed to sign a purchase and sale contract within one week.
However, after that, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory building to be sold and the payment method, causing the real estate purchase and sale contract to be delayed in signing.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin (someone) returned 200,000 yuan in deposit to Mr. Lu.
It's not easy to see the house from the middle, the down payment has been paid and the mortgage has been prepared, just need to sign the contract, but the seller didn't sell it, which makes the landlord very unhappy.
"For this reason, Senior Lu will prosecute Lin to the Yuyang People's Court."
According to the court's review, it is considered that the two parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and it is not reasonable to hold only the defendant responsible, so it is inferred that the plaintiff is at fault, and therefore this case does not meet the conditions for imposing a fine, and the defendant is not required to double repay the fine.
"After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appeals."
Recently, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has maintained the original judgment.
"【Lawyer's Reminder】 It is important to exercise caution and fulfill one's duty of care during the transaction process."
"When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence and attention to detail, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied or not, and clearly stipulating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes during performance of the contract."

"As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and resist the encroachment and impact of those who seek power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not something that comes naturally, "we must continuously update it in every generation, in my opinion, this is our critical challenge in this era."

The translation for the sentence is: "Educational thinking: How to let "study bullies" and "study slackers" each get what they deserve in college entrance exams."
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leader, reflecting their confusion about the university entrance examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the form of the examination questions, and make the examination truly reflect the students' actual abilities.
"Indeed, for a long time, college entrance exams have always been a "hot topic.""
In the university campus, students come from the five lakes and the four seas, and their abilities vary, and furthermore, their learning progress is not the same, the learning situation is diverse and varied.
"For groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable to have different feelings."
"Of course, if the exam questions are all of the same type and the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another kind of feeling that is completely different."
"不用功的学生，可能考前集中突击就能及格，如果再想其他方法，有可能达到事半功倍的效果."
"So, it turns out that even if one doesn't study hard, they can still pass the test, and even get a high score. And as for the "study bully," even if they don't fall behind in class, do their homework, or take notes, they still have a "strange phenomenon" on the test."
"In this way, it seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in college entrance exams, and it is not without reason. It is believed that such a situation is not only limited to Lanzhou University."
From the perspective of this layer of meaning, it is necessary to praise these three students for their academic achievements.
In fact, most people who have graduated from college are aware of this, and there are various ways to cheat on exams, such as bribing teachers to get exam questions, competing to narrow down the exam scope, and seeking "point-by-point guidance" from teachers before the exam. Even during the exam, some students bring cheat sheets and try to get the attention of high-scoring teachers. This is not an uncommon phenomenon.
According to the author, as a way of evaluating the quality of education, assessing whether a student passes or fails an exam is more important than the teacher's overall grasp of teaching and learning and scientific problems based on this foundation.
"Entering the undergraduate stage, specialties begin to differentiate, and many specialized courses focus on fundamental knowledge."
"Do not be negligent, is it thorough to grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject, is it what universities examine in the examination?"
And the basic knowledge of undergraduate education mainly consists of the fundamental theories and basic common sense of the discipline, from the perspective of knowledge points, the space for change is not large, and the basic is generally fixed.
"Just as the teacher said, '20 years ago, learning basic mathematical knowledge in college is still important now.'"
"But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and do not represent a single type of exam question or repeated test questions."
In many universities, examinations are generally composed of question groups, which are then compiled by subject experts into a test paper, and the examination paper is also reviewed by all the teachers in that subject. This helps to avoid the problem of repeated questions to some extent.
But to draft a set of test items that conform to teaching and practical needs, the topic of the test items should be based on the overall learning situation of the students, and the difficulty and ease should follow a normal distribution. In addition, a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation is needed, and the learning level of the students should be fully analyzed, so that the test items can reflect the difficulty and ease, the item type can be dynamic, and both the basic knowledge examination and the ability examination can be considered. At the same time, the item type should be innovatively designed.
"Examinations are the whip of university education, and what kind of examination it is, the students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the past, this has had an impact on the effectiveness of university education."
"For the students' recommendation letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has already implemented a comprehensive reform plan throughout the school."
"Require each educational unit to organize teachers to conduct a seminar and final examination self-inspection, formulate the examination question paper and relevant systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination question paper and review process, and pay close attention to the evaluation of the results."
The English translation for the sentence is:  "Solving the problems of single-type exam questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is a topic that universities need to confront in their exams. Of course, appropriate systems need to be established, but the key lies in the teacher's comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It is not enough to understand the contents of the curriculum, but it is also necessary to understand the learning situation of the students. Two heads are better than one, and teaching and learning will be better matched, forming a positive interaction, and the exams will be more in line with reality, so that "study hard" and "slack off" can each receive their due."

According to the notice, the time range for meeting the above requirements is from the day of determining the port city range in each province, city, and municipality, and announcing it, to March 15, 2022.
"Furthermore, the notice also proposed that under certain conditions, cities near the mouth of a river may be studied for the establishment of an epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within the administrative region."

According to the notice, the aforementioned port cities include the open land, sea, and air ports located in the county (city, district, banner), the city (province, city, league) where they are located, and the directly governed city, and the specific range will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly governed city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

This sentence describes a film that tells the story of the United States launching the "War on Terror" under the name of "Afghantistan" and, through the war, forcibly exporting American-style democracy in a 20-year period of poverty, bloodlust, and atrocities, committing various crimes against humanity.

By chance, I came across an article discussing why this customer wants a logistics company in the tax-free zone to help with packaging, even though packaging belongs to deep processing and is not within the operational scope of the tax-free logistics company. Perhaps the following text can explain why the customer wants to do this.
"I have visited many dairy factories and have come into contact with many dairy production lines."
In fact, the raw materials for packaging and listening devices are the same, without any difference.
So everyone will ask: Why is the warranty period for appliances one year, while the warranty period for hearing aids is two years or longer?
"Or ask: Why is the price difference between hearing aids and hearing aids so large?"
"In fact, starting from this point, many consumers, or those at the motherly level, believe that this is because the raw materials are not the same, so the quality will be much better."
Actually, the original materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that the expensive ones are good.
"Consumers may also eat out of this mindset and then complain about the aftertaste or flavor, saying it's not the same as eating with chopsticks!"
"Now I will tell you the reason why it is expensive, where is the costly part?"
"Why do they have such a large price difference even though their raw materials are the same?"
"Because most factories consider that if the packaging is priced too high, consumers will find it hard to accept it, which means that the factory's profits are very low or even non-existent. Then how does the factory survive?"
Therefore, they have a very large increase in pricing to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most factory owners push for hearing aids, rather than earplugs.
"There is also the fact that you want so many factories to spend so much on advertising every year, even reaching several million or even several billion, where does this cost come from?"
The English translation for the sentence "大家可想而知" is "Everyone can think and know."
As society develops, the cost of market promotion, such as mall promoters, display fees, product giveaway costs, and advertising fees, is constantly increasing.
Therefore, each factory is also constantly introducing new products, and they are all customized, and their prices are also constantly increasing. In fact, this is due to the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increase in their raw materials cost will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There is a part of the brand that, in order to promote their products, does not hesitate to use any means, and even collaborates with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products. From a single hearing, they can earn profits of 30 yuan to 80 yuan or more.
"However, the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operating methods, and in fact, this kind of behavior is harmful to consumers."
It is recommended that everyone buy packaged milk powder and pour it into their own containers under the condition of having a container at home, which can save costs, increase the preservation and sealing properties of milk powder, and have no impact on children.
"There is also the belief that the warranty period for hearing aids is longer than that for wax earplugs, but if the warranty period for hearing aids and earplugs is the same after opening the package, it is only said that earplugs are not easy to preserve after opening the package and are prone to deterioration."
"Dinner was delayed and the food got cold, and then it got dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it."

The English translation for this sentence is: "If you don't return the money, I will report you to the police."
"Multiple times using #PRS\_ORG# today, this is the worst experience."
The English translation for "完全不能接受" is "completely unable to accept."
The English translation for "好的，可以" is "Okay, can do."
"But also need to remind the restaurant and the riders."
The English translation for the sentence "避免下次再发生" is "Avoid recurrence in the future."
I want to know the exact delivery time.
"That time is constantly being delayed."
"Don't know when to wait for what."
"If the order is cancelled, can I get my money back?"
"How do I pay for the service fee for the bike rider?"
"One has already been confirmed to be a bicyclist several hours ago."
"Not willing to wait anymore."
"Don't push people to the starting line."
"Browsing in a book market often allows one to feel the explosive excitement of successful academic books."
The English translation for the sentence is: "Many successful self-help books today promote the idea of the 'best principle' - that is, assuming or hinting that you can 'do it' and then telling you what you need to do to achieve it."
"It can be said that the child has passed through the most important and fundamental stage of 'how to do it.'"
"Therefore, all these books have a common characteristic - either you do it well or you don't do it at all; either you succeed or you fail; either you are 100% or you are 0%; either you climb Mount Tai or you give up in your hometown."
This "best principle" allows anyone to acknowledge that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be knocked over before the starting line.
This sentence can be translated to: "Because this theory advocates for a path of 'you must hurt your heart, remake yourself, and make a 180-degree turnaround' which is just a fatal weakness for many people."
For those who insist on adhering to the rules, following the old ways, and rejecting change, you should loudly whisper in their ear, "You need to change." This is undoubtedly self-deception and a futile attempt to deceive others.
Most people will reveal their impatience in front of the two words "turning point", covering their feet and hesitating, finding it hard to make a decision; or else, relying on a momentary surge of pain to make the decision to "turn", and bravely taking the first step, but often the good scene does not last long, and they cannot sustain it for long, so it is difficult to see persistence.
The English translation for the sentence is: "The famous monologue from the book 'From Tomorrow I Begin' by Lao She, which vividly expresses the classic "universal human nature."
The greatest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability, making it impossible for the vast majority of people to "exclaim at the door."
"Perhaps 'second-best principle' is a path that more ordinary people can walk on to achieve relative success."
The core of "second best" lies in "lowering the threshold." It encourages a theory of "small wins lead to big wins," that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is also okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dune by your front door is also okay, because that is stronger than the original.
The English translation for the sentence "总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强" is "In the end, as long as you do something, you are stronger than those who do nothing."
The English translation for the sentence is:  "Because the threshold has been lowered greatly, it has become easier for ordinary people to persist, and even trivial matters can be achieved with persistence, increasing the probability of success."
"However, the path to success by following the "second-best principle" is relatively short."
In summary, the "best principle" may appear on the surface to be a flag that can make everyone successful, but in reality, it can only motivate a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and maximize the benefits for as many people as possible.

The English translation for "电话无人接听" is "Phone not answered."

He didn't deliver the two meals, but an order has already been completed.
I would like to ask how to contact a bicycle messenger.
"Just now, the first bicycle rider told me, there will be another bicycle rider coming later."
"The amount of rare earth resources concentrated in the Qinghai Lake area has increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Net."
Xinhua News Agency in Xining, Gansu Province, reported on December 11 (Reporter Liu Chunfeng and Zhang Hongyong) that the latest monitoring results show that the amount of phytoplankton in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tonnes this year, reaching 10.85 million tonnes, which is an increase of 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The English translation for the sentence is:  "The blue sea bream, a local specialty in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species in Qinghai Lake and plays a weighty role in ensuring the security and biodiversity of the 'water-fish-bird' ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed."
In the 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, human activities such as large-scale killing and promiscuous breeding caused the environment in the lake to deteriorate, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of sturgeon in Lake Baikal. In 2002, the amount of sturgeon resources stored in Lake Baikal was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the "Red List of Endangered Species in China" listed the naked carp in Qinghai Lake as a critically endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of stocking fish in the closed waters, prohibiting any unit, group, or individual from catching grass carp in Qinghai Lake and its major tributaries and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of grass carp and its products.
At the same time, by means of artificial propagation and the release of cultured fish, as well as the construction of scientifically designed "fish bypass channels" and other measures, the protective force has been continuously strengthened, and the amount of stored fry resources in Blue Lake has been increasing year by year.
The English translation for the sentence is:  "Yang Lin, the vice director of the Agricultural Bureau in Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, the number of artificially propagated and released finless porpoises in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 1.8 million, and the contribution rate to the recovery of the finless porpoise resources in Qinghai Lake is over 23%."
The English translation for the sentence is: "The source regions of the Three Rivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are an important ecological barrier and water source area in our country, and the Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier that controls the expansion of desertification from the west to the east and plays an important ecological role."
"To protect the ecological environment in the source areas of the Three Rivers, the Qinghai Lake water area, and to protect aquatic wildlife, to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year, the Qinghai Lake, Yellow River, and Yangtze River have successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in the key water areas, and established a comprehensive prohibition on fishing management system of 'one river, one lake, one sea'."

The English translation for the sentence "想问一下，外卖是装在一个袋子中吗？" is "I wonder if the outsider is put in a bag?"

Most girls will experience their first menstrual period between the ages of 13 and 15, and will continue to menstruate until around the age of 50.
"After being healthy, it will come more regularly each month."
"But it is not accurate to predict to the exact day, with a margin of about a week, and you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes the weather can also be unpredictable and change by several days (suddenly several days earlier)."
"The duration of time, the amount of blood, and the intensity of pain vary from person to person; some people recover in three days, while others take a week; some people have little bleeding, while others have a lot; some people have no reaction, while others are in such pain that they have to be taken to the hospital by ambulance; the intensity of pain changes with time, and just because someone is not in pain now does not mean they will not be in pain in the future."
"The moon is unable to control it, starting from the beginning to the end of several days within 24 hours, the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary napkins to prevent blood from flowing onto the chair."
"Pain mainly results from the secretion of prostaglandins, and just before the onset of menstruation, it is recommended to quickly eat ibuprofen to effectively alleviate the pain of that month, and after the onset of menstruation, it is not necessary to eat anything."
Before the physiological period, due to the uterus being full of blood and the release of too much progesterone, it is easy to swell the abdomen.
"If it's almost the period, don't be surprised if your stomach is bloated, and you'll probably get your period within two days."
"Sanitary pads are best changed every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy for bacteria to breed. Except for sleeping time, the worst situation is changing six times a day, which is 42 pieces a month. If you prepare in advance, you may have 50 pieces, and it is not necessary to use one piece every month."
"Please modify this part. It is not necessary to change the toilet paper often. You can change it once every five or six hours, and at the longest, once every eight hours."
"月经期荷尔蒙作祟可能会比较暴躁，排卵期也会因为体内激素变化情绪不稳定，就是很倒霉，身体给自己使绊子。"  "During the menstrual period, hormonal changes may cause more severe mood swings, and the premenstrual period may also be affected due to changes in hormone levels, resulting in mood instability, which is very irritable, and the body gives itself a hard time."
But official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control their emotions is quite high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
"流的并不只是血，其中包含脱落的子宫内膜。" translates to "The flow is not only blood, it contains the shedding endometrium."
The translation for the sentence is:  "After the conclusion of the month, the innermost layer of the uterus becomes the thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus being a house. Each month, the house is built (the innermost layer thickens) to prepare to welcome guests, but the guests have not come, so everything is dismantled (the month is expelled) and restarted the following month."
"The moon is not convenient, continuing for several decades, each month several days 24 hours of bleeding, and also stomach and back pain, who would want it?"
However, people can be born because their mother passed through the monthly cycle, and the monthly cycle is to prepare a house for you for the first time you come to this world to live for 10 months. We should all thank our mothers for their healthy monthly cycle.
Before, many things that women did were suppressed, society told women that it was shameful and embarrassing, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
"If someone thinks the moon is wicked and thinks that women's bodies are only prepared for pregnancy with a wicked heart, they should not speak out in public. Girls, do not think this way anymore. Boys who have never experienced it should not be so ungrateful. They do not know how to repay kindness and do not know how to be filial to their mothers. How can they face their own mothers and how can they want their own children?"
"Finally, let's try the sanitary pads, they are really good."
"Today is Winter Solstice, sending wrong makes people disappointed."
"Want to order some food for the little friend to eat?"
"I hope that in the midst of the busy store, all products will be checked."
The English translation for the sentence "足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？" is "Is it leaking electricity because the bathtub is boiling the feet?"
"Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can play a very good role in foot care, and today, we will give an answer to this problem at the national beauty salon, hoping to be helpful to our friends."
With the increasing awareness of people's health, foot baths have become more and more popular among consumers, and a variety of products have appeared on the market, ranging from dozens to hundreds of yuan, providing consumers with a large selection space.
In related data surfaces, compared to traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare-related home appliances such as foot baths are booming, but foot baths do not have special industry standards, which poses a certain safety risk.
"Swimming with electric eels, isn't that too dangerous?"
Li Shifu told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but when his father used it, he felt a burning sensation on his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the shaking function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't turn off the shaking function, and his father still felt a strange sensation on his feet.
"Li Shifu tried using an electric pen, and the pen suddenly lit up. Li Shifu was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub was electrified."
"Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he had to give up the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable."
"Because he found that this already popular bathtub has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicability to what kind of population, what kind of material guarantees no harm."
But in general, a bathtub is not likely to have electrical problems, but it is also not excluded that a small number of products may not have strict inspection at the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a divided bathroom basin.
"Water and electricity separation, there is no safety concern."
At the same time, you can take the electrical pen test freely.

If you are planning to enter this industry, it is possible to choose to go to a place to receive training, but if you don't have that kind of idea, it's best to self-study, after all, training requires a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control.
"If you have a strong self-study ability, you can choose to self-study, but it will be quite tiring."
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important matter.
First, let's look at the human resources of this organization. If the human resources are not strong enough, this training organization has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training organizations may not have particularly strong human resources.
"Before choosing, it's best to investigate this training institution, and it's best to investigate the students who have graduated from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know the real situation of the institution, and the quality of the courses can be discussed."
"Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't introduced my own situation to you, and there is a direct relationship between learning this and your personal circumstances."
For example, profession, age, language learning, even in which city, all of these will have a relationship with the industry you want to learn or work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science major and have already graduated, then I recommend self-study if you have sufficient time. This is the most cost-effective and has the lowest cost, and there are many online and offline training institutions that are not bad. However, the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is relatively large. In general, it takes 3-6 months to concentrate on training.
However, if it is about the situations that I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources on the internet, or there are also many training resources at the B station. If you don't find resources, you can also introduce yourself to me to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also available.
"There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video-based learning."
If you are not a computer science major but can afford to pay for some study costs and time, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much money, and the teachers' explanations will be very detailed. There will be someone to answer questions specifically, and there will also be help in planning or supervision.
"Moreover, many training institutions nowadays will sign employment contracts, and have a quota for internal recommendations. After completing their studies, they will recommend students to companies, which can save them a lot of trouble in finding a job."

However, I still believe that as long as you maintain a serious attitude, persevere, and work hard, you will be better than others, at least stronger than those who always complain.
The English translation for the sentence is: "The plan for a day lies in the morning, all the good things start from a clear morning. I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, and contentment with you, and start a new day with a good mood. Stay happy all day."
When I was young, happiness was a thing, having it made me happy; when I grew up, happiness became a goal, reaching it made me happy; when I became mature, I found out that happiness was originally a state of mind, understanding it made me happy.
"Be the most honest and kind to yourself, follow your heart and have no regrets in life; life is a one-way road, walk your own path; life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, enjoy life to the fullest!"
"At each stage of life, one will encounter different difficulties."
"很多时候，束缚住你的并不是能力，而是积极面对的勇气。" translates to "Many times, the shackles that bind you are not your ability, but rather the courage to confront positively."

Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists take up more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installations, and performance art in various forms; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, and some artists use recycled materials to create new works, such as Xu Beihong in her series "Behind the Scenes: The Endless River" (2014), who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials.
Diriye Double Year Exhibition Chief Executive Officer Barakli stated that he hopes this year's Double Year Exhibition can establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural and creative industry of Saudi Arabia and its innovative community, and strengthen interaction between the two.
Mao Zedong said: "The goal of the Double Tenth Exhibition is double-sided. On the one hand, it can allow contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, and on the other hand, it can allow audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to the information, a series of lectures will be held during the two-year run of the exhibition, and artistic leaders, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will engage in discussions on topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Although the right-wingers have had their moments of glory in history, they didn't last long. This is because they are easily swayed by a little bit of sunshine or a drop of water. If they are given a little bit of power, they become arrogant and start causing trouble.
"But in reality, the right-wing has played a positive role in the progress of society."
"From ending the cultural revolution and defining the truth standard, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the establishment of the political system and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied."

In the past two years, the US's embargo and blockade of Huawei chips have not only caused Huawei to face unprecedented difficulties, but also led to huge losses for "US-style" companies.
"美帝打压中国芯片产业，要求自家企业及盟友国相关企业同时对我国芯片产业进行封锁，直接导致的后果就是全球芯片供应商的订单和利润受到影响，造成芯片生产企业的研发投入降低、产能下降，从而造成了全球范围内芯片供应链的短缺的紊乱。"  English translation: "The United States is putting pressure on China's semiconductor industry
"Now that 'shortage' has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car companies stopping production and mobile phone price hikes, almost all industries that use chips are affected by it."
"In order to grasp the 'semiconductor' self-determination, more and more technology giants in various countries are moving towards a 'going global' path."
To tightly control the global semiconductor industry and control the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has frequently taken actions recently, and also hosted the "Semiconductor Summit" and invited 64 heads of state to establish a semiconductor alliance to support American domestic high-tech giants, such as Intel, which has invested $200 billion to regain its leading position in the semiconductor industry by building a second wafer factory in Arizona and opening up its semiconductor foundry business to the outside.
When most people believe that Intel's latest move will have a certain impact on Taiwan's electronics industry and may even snatch away Taiwan's "rice bowl."
The reason why this is so certain is because Intel, as a leading technology giant in the US, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor industry for over 30 years and has a large pool of talented personnel and technological reserves. Therefore, it is certain to rapidly rise and defeat TSMC in a short period of time.
However, with respect to Intel's decision, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor, Zhang Zhidong, did not care less.
"At the '2021 Mastermind Summit' held in April this year, Zhang Zhiang's words caused a sensation, and he spoke candidly about why he opposed the proposal to establish a crystal factory by Intel. Zhang Zhiang said, 'Establishing a foundry for Intel's logic chips is equivalent to poking fun at it.'"
The English translation for the sentence is:  "The reason why Zhang Zhihuan is not worried about the entry of the United States into the diamond industry is because Zhang Zhihuan has been nursing his grudge against the United States for more than 30 years of accumulated grievances."
In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Elizabeth I always shone as a gem in the British manufacturing industry, occupying the pinnacle of global fame, and was the undisputed ruler of the world's semi-conductor industry.
"In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been monopolized by a small number of strong players."
At that time, the semiconductor industry had a characteristic IDM mode, and the entire chip, from design to testing, was completed by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes it difficult for some small businesses to survive, and many semi-conductor entrepreneurs face huge construction costs for their production lines but can only dream about it.
Under the call of market demand in the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to exhibit the phenomenon of cooperative division of labor, and in 1984, Zhang Zhihuan heard that there was a company specializing in semiconductor design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, they could establish a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
"Not long after, Zhang Zhiang's plan became a reality, and Tai Jiu Electric was established."
"Tai Ji Electric has targeted the 'diamond processing' single node, without design, only providing outsourcing services for diamond manufacturing."
At the time when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was just established, it was still a small and insignificant player in the eyes of Intel, the giant in the industry.
"In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhi even tried to seek investment from Intel, but at the time, Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor only engaged in the manufacturing chain of the semiconductor industry, which was obviously a bit arrogant, and didn't care about Taiwan Semiconductor. They firmly rejected investing in Taiwan Semiconductor."
The English translation for the sentence is: "Even Zhang Zhao also acknowledged that at that time, he did not pay attention to the process of providing jade-like service."
"没想到当年看不起晶圆制造服务的巨头，如今却也要开始做晶圆代工."  English translation: "I never thought about the difficulties of manufacturing jewelry services when I was young, but now I also have to start doing jewelry OEM."
Therefore, Zhang Zhan believes that Intel's entry into the diamond industry is very painful.
"Now the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor has already exceeded that of Intel."
Confronted with the strength of the tide in Taiwan, Intel is also unwilling to take a step back and seal itself off.
"Now, TSMC has already pushed towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still staying at 14nm from 7 years ago."
"Wanting to surpass one's actual abilities is not an easy task."
The English translation for "不等了" is "not yet."
"By 19:06, I had already placed the order for 2 hours."
The English translation for the sentence "今天来看一些【奇怪的热搜】" is "Come and see some strange hot searches today."
What is normal social behavior?
Randomly select three hot search terms: February Two Dragons, Good-looking Friend's Price Increase, and Car Incident, which spreads the mood and forms a peak, and then the index drops (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, and if there is a second wave of mood, a small peak will reappear.
"They look completely different from the 'Network Sentiment Transformation Model' that was displayed on the official website of the network and information department."
What is an abnormal mood?
The English translation for the sentence "随机挑选同一事件中的六个热搜，呈现出【孤峰状】、【锯齿状】、【断崖状】" is:  Randomly select six hot search terms related to the same event, and display the following shapes: [peak shape], [sharp tooth shape], [cliff shape].
"【孤峰状】" translates to "peak state," "【锯齿状】" translates to "periodic peak state," and "【断崖状】" translates to "sharp peak state."
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of an event is almost exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is only a matter of seconds. This must be a unified task force receiving orders to launch a new offensive.
The professionalization of propaganda can be seen at a glance: dozens of hot search at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularizing science, which ones are responsible for shaping public opinion, which ones shift the focus of attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones lead to incorrect judgments, which ones arouse emotions, which ones control decision-making, and almost consider all elements of the diffusion of social sentiment.
"Propaganda is a science, throwing out all subjective factors such as opinions and emotions, and only relying on objective data, even black propaganda cannot be avoided."
"Leave a trace wherever you go, and we'll dig it out together."
The translation for the sentence "数据来源：热搜时光机" in English is "Data source: hot search engine."

"At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at my initial budget of 70,000 yuan for basic renovation."
"As soon as I got to the store, I started a series of scams."
"I am a first-time customer and all I did was show them my house plan. They didn't even go to the site to measure the house, but they were able to give me a quote for my 135 square meter house for 7 million yuan, roughly. They didn't even look at the materials they were using, so I have no idea what brand of materials they used."
Their second scam is that as soon as you come to the store, they'll drag you to the counter and make you pay the deposit (and this money is non-refundable once you've paid it, unless you have enough experience and can argue with them about it).
"When I was hesitating about whether to exchange money or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you exchange money today, you will get how much discount."

"Remove these service fees they charge and it will be higher than that of other companies."
"I lost confidence in this company, and from the beginning, they didn't clarify everything, so I signed the contract."
When I went to ask them for their money back, they displayed a very experienced attitude, with a special team dedicated to dealing with me.
Regardless of how it happens, biting off more than you can chew is the customer's problem, and they are entirely to blame.
"Various push-out responsibilities, as well as many details, don't want to say one by one, in short, don't choose them because my friend hired them to renovate the house and the quality is not good, resulting in various fees for you later."
"Pitfall, they are the original dragon head decorations that fooled people, now they have become big and it seems like they have closed their eyes and changed into something else."

The English translation for the sentence is: "The stars have about 14 days of Scorpio double stars and welcome the great rain of meteor showers on the 14th day."
According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin on December 12, a specialist in astronomy introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Double Cluster Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will arrive on December 14, and those who love meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
"Beijing city amateur astronomers An Jiu 2018 December 13th in Qinghai took a picture of the double star rainbow."
Most of the meteor showers' parent bodies are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Double Cluster meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
"双子座流星雨" is also the second known meteor shower that is not caused by the "pregnant" star.
The translation for the sentence is:  The president of the Tianjin City Astronomical Society and a well-known expert in popularizing astronomy, Peng Xuesen, introduced that just like having a birthday, the Double Ninth Festival is generally accompanied by a meteor shower in late life, and the "viewing period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
"The Big Dipper rain is known for its large flow and stability, and is called the Big Dipper rain along with the North Pole rain and the Aquarius rain on the northern hemisphere."
One notable feature of the Double Cluster Meteor Shower is that the meteor speed is slower, the color is rich, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for both visual observation and beginner astrophotography.
"On December 13th, 2020, in Tianjin, Yang Jing, a lover of astronomy in Tianjin, captured a double star rainbow in the constellation of the Twins."
According to the astronomical forecast, this year's Gemini meteor shower will arrive on December 14th around 15:00 and reach its peak with a ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions) of 150.
The English translation for "双子座流星雨推荐指数图" is "Gemini horoscope rainfall recommendation index chart."
"Last year, the 'Falling Petals' double star rainbow left a deep impression on people, but this year's double star rainbow will be affected by moonlight interference and the degree of brilliance will decrease slightly."
On November 11th, which is the 11th day of the agricultural calendar, the moon is in the full moon phase, and it is a bright moon. The bright moonlight will cause interference during observation, and it will be best to observe in the latter half of the night when the moon is low. At this time, the radiation point of the double star in the constellation of the Twins will also be relatively high.
"喜欢流星雨的朋友可在后半夜月落后的这几个小时进行观测，但要注意防寒保暖。" translates to "Friends who like shooting stars can observe in the several hours after the half-moon sets in the latter half of the night, but be sure to pay attention to keeping warm."
"How can we observe as many shooting stars as possible?"
It is not recommended to observe the phenomenon in the city. You can choose a place in the suburbs or countryside that is high, has little light pollution, and faces towards the northeastern direction. Then, wait patiently until the moon has set, and you can start observing the phenomenon.
It is worth noting that the flow of both stars in the Double Helix nebula in each direction is very large, so when observing, do not stare continuously at the Double Helix nebula's radiation point.
If you like photography and want to capture the stunning 'Meteor Rainbow', it is best to choose a wide-angle lens and a large aperture, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
"Based on stability and durability considerations, a tripod stand, a backup battery, and a power cable are also indispensable."
The English translation for "修立鹏提醒说" is "A reminder from a stork."
What is the difference in market positioning between laser televisions and traditional televisions?
According to my understanding, the "traditional television" referred to by the topic should be the liquid crystal television, and the main differences in market positioning between the laser television and the liquid crystal television mainly include the following two points:
The English translation for the sentence "第一，激光电视更聚焦大屏市场" is "Firstly, laser TV focuses more on the big screen market."
Compared with the market positioning of liquid crystal televisions with full-screen display, the positioning of laser televisions is more focused on the large-screen market, or even say that laser televisions themselves are a product born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream sizes of liquid crystal televisions are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally above 75 inches, with some even exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large, high-definition screens.
In recent years, the output and sales volume of laser televisions have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales volume of televisions above 80 inches.
According to the prediction of China Electronics, in 2020, the market sales of laser televisions are expected to grow by more than 140%, and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason why there are such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TVs in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television reflection, the laser light source emitted does not directly enter the eyeball, compared to the backlight of a liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of object imaging, and the stimulus to the eye is also smaller.
The English translation for the sentence is: "The Institute of Standardization of Electronic Technology in China, in cooperation with the Experimental Laboratory of West China and the ophthalmology experts of Beijing Calibration Hospital, conducted a strict comparison test under the same population conditions for watching laser TVs and liquid crystal TVs, and obtained 144 sets of test data."
"Data validation: Laser TV indeed has very strong eye-protection characteristics, and in certain aspects even has a certain improvement effect."
As visual health becomes increasingly valued in the current era, laser TV not only attracts more users by virtue of its eye-protecting advantages, but also opens up a new breakthrough in the PV market.
The English translation for the sentence "第二，激光电视更聚焦高端市场" is "Secondly, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market."
"Opposite to the price of LCD televisions, the price of LED televisions is constantly being investigated. Currently, the price of LED televisions is mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually rising."
What is so expensive about laser TV certificates?
"肯定是有道理的" translates to "The affirmation is reasonable."
"Under the continuous development of light source and technology, laser television has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal televisions and projectors."
"By using ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection devices. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, and the required space is not large. Moreover, it is small and compact, occupying little space."
In terms of brightness, high-end brand LED TVs can achieve a luminance of over 2000.
"Adding to this, the heat generated is even lower, the device loss is smaller, and the lifespan of the television is even longer."
"Besides this, many high-end laser TV models also load many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and synthetic screens, which can bring users a more stunning visual and auditory experience."
Don't talk about false needs, but rather the products of needs fine-tuning, the discussion of the quality and input-output ratio of paintings, laser TV is not a dish for audiovisual players, if you want to consider both large-screen viewing and poor viewing environment, you can try it, everything has its pros and cons, and self-judgment after weighing the advantages and disadvantages is recommended, lest one hear only one side of the story.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle projection machine - laser TV, in order to attach close to the screen, it is necessary to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors, which does not conform to the optimal optical design.
"To hide part of the environmental light, use a fine-structured fiber optic screen, which is expensive, and the price of the 80-inch screen is basically the same as swapping out a 65-inch liquid crystal screen."
There is one more thing I particularly dislike, that is, the projector manufacturers selling "direct reflection" as a selling point, saying that it is good for the eyes. The light on the screen that the eyes can see is actually direct light. If you reflect it on the ceiling, the eyes cannot see it. It is not necessary to be more true than a liquid crystal television, which also has a "direct reflection" function. Do you need to open the television ceiling to be illuminated?
"And furthermore, the projection screen fabric will not work properly if it is not anti-glare. In other words, it cannot be made to work."
The phrase "恰恰被忽略了高增益幕布的热斑（光斑）效应，某一角度大量光线反射到眼睛，那才是真难受" can be translated to "The hot spots (light spots) on the high-gain screen are difficult to ignore, especially when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle."
"The visual aesthetics photography library preferred quality store is temporarily without branches."
"After adding the WeChat appointment date, my little sister arranged the available time for me to choose from and replied to my message quite promptly."
"I looked at the photography works in the store before, more of them were outdoor wedding photos, and they were all very beautiful. The photography style involved in them was also very diverse."
The English translation for the sentence is:  "After arriving at the studio, I had a simple conversation with my little sister about my ideas, and patiently helped me try on two different styles of clothing that I was unsure of. In the end, we finally confirmed the makeup and hairstyle, and the photographer will arrange some props and guide the actions before the shooting. They will also pay attention to every detail."
However, it's possible that we didn't have specific communication about the shooting ideas, so the final result may not be the style I wanted, but it should be visually pleasing 🙊🙊.
After taking good photos, the photographer will help choose pictures, discuss post-shoot styles, and feel that the team is quite meticulous.
"修好的片大约要半个月，坐等效果~" translates to "A well-edited video takes about half a month, the waiting effect is ~" in English.
The English translation for this sentence is: "The second time around, there was a photo shoot-themed feast event ~ Most of the on-site clothing can be selected to take a photo."
"Finally chose a black lace dress, experienced different styles."
The entire filming process took about two hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer in charge of filming is the nephew of the 95 generation, and he feels a little fresh and green. He hopes to be able to give more suggestions in the future for customer filming actions. The filming process was quite pleasant.
The English translation for this sentence is: "Visual aesthetics photography library preferred quality store replied."
The English translation for this sentence is: "She went to the front page, let's take a look and see Queenie."
"Before arriving, I filled out my name and phone number, and chose the clothing, including the wedding dress, and changed into several sets of clothing, and the staff were very patient. After choosing, I spent a long time having my makeup and hair done, and the service attitude was also good. They will teach you how to pose for the photo shoot, so that you can feel like your face is too big, and the finishing touches will take half a month, arriving three or four days later, and it feels like there is not much difference from the original."
The English translation for "【环境】整体还好." is "Overall, the environment is good."
The English translation for "可选衣服很多" is "There are many optional clothes."
The English translation for this sentence is: "The difference in makeup position is not large, and there is a photography studio inside."
The English translation for the sentence "【服务】很热情，也很细心" is "The service is very enthusiastic and also very meticulous."
The English translation for "造型师挺有耐心的" is "The stylist has a lot of patience."
"Photographers will also be very meticulous in teaching you poses."
"Not satisfied, the photographer will also actively propose reshooting."
"【Experience】It's possible that the design is a bit outdated, as the original double eyelids have been replaced with three eyelids."
"The mustache was also shaved off, it's a bit embarrassing for daily life without a mustache."
"The photo has been sent for ten days, but the P-graph effect is not satisfactory, and I still feel that my double eyelids are very obvious."
"Because I'm not sure what style to choose, I tried two sets. The result was hit or miss. I even chose a black tuxedo, and my little sister said this set is quite retro-chic."
"选好衣服后就开始弄妆发啦 发型师和化妆师小姐姐都超级耐心在帮我弄 弄出来的效果非常满意" translates to: "After choosing the clothes, I started doing my makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist sisters were extremely patient in helping me, and the result was very satisfying."
"After putting on makeup, the photographer started taking pictures. The entire process was under the control of the photographer, and it was very smooth and harmonious."
After taking the photos, he carefully chose the four photos he liked the most, and the little brother said he would make a 15-minute video with a satisfying ending.
"It has been 3 days since I haven't received a reply... Because your system is unable to recognize my credit card, therefore I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly plan!"
The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card to make payments.
"I have to pay shipping fees every time now."
"Can I first make a down payment, and then collect your monthly fee after you have finished your investigation? Is that okay?"
Does the small umbrella buy insurance?
"小雨伞" is a financial services platform for the internet.
"From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the 'Regulations on the Administration of Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Revised)', in order to become an insurance intermediary, it is necessary to satisfy three key words: shareholder, no major violations in the past three years, and the minimum capital requirement is RMB 5000 million."
This sentence can be translated to:  "These three conditions are actually very strict. In summary, you need to have strength, and you need to pass the approval of the national regulatory department of the insurance company and the bank, and the shareholders must have a good reputation. As a small insurance agency of the little umbrella insurance, the insurance purchaser does not need to doubt whether the little umbrella insurance is legal or not, after all, there are these three conditions, and no insurance company can achieve this."
"On this point, it's not bad, it's worth trusting."
From the perspective of insurance products, the small umbrella insurance is like an insurance supermarket, where many companies' star products are sold, such as the latest Tai Chi 5 Super Critical Illness Insurance, and both the claimant and the insurer are Tai people. The small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the perspective of the pay-as-you-go model: The products on internet platforms, because they lack the operating costs of business nodes and labor costs, are generally priced relatively high, and the pay-as-you-go model is flexible, supports monthly payment, reduces the insurance premium burden on the insured, and at the same time can maximize the swing of the insurance umbrella.
"This point is still quite good."
"Can be considered."
From a professional perspective, this point is particularly important because the insurance industry has very high professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves, which can result in many errors in health notification and occupational categories. Insurance professionals often add their own subjective consciousness when insuring themselves, believing themselves to be healthy or suitable, which can easily result in many hidden risks and the risk of being rejected.
"I used to work at 'Tencent Weipao' (it's like Little Red Riding Hood, and it's also an internet insurance platform) doing insurance phone sales, and I want to take responsibility and tell everyone."
The translation for the sentence is:  "The insurance on the internet is real, but also relies on trust, it is the people who do not rely on trust, the internet channel does not have professional staff, and there are many sales misleads."
Here is the English translation for the sentence:  "For example, a 1 yuan insurance policy can cover 600 million, buy insurance and get a free mobile phone, and enjoy a free annual health check-up worth 60,000 yuan. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are superficial and do not inform the insurance purchaser that the first month's premium is only 1 yuan, and the subsequent month's premium may be several tens to 200 yuan, and many customers do not know what they are paying for when they purchase insurance for one or two years."
"Thinking you can spend 1 yuan, the insurance company will compensate 600 million (a drop in the ocean)."
"Free send mobile phone, it is only for special insurance numbers like 6666, 8888 that are sent, and even if the winning message is sent, you don't need to exchange it, and no one will remind you."
This sentence can be translated to: "For the insurance policy holder, it is also a pitfall to have free coverage of up to 60,000 yuan for serious illnesses, as it is only temporary, and if there are no other commercial insurance policies, what if a serious illness occurs and the 60,000 yuan is not enough to solve the problem? It will not even cover the cost of living in the future."
"Currently, the state is strictly cracking down on misleading advertising for online insurance sales."
"Therefore, overall, the platform has no problems, the product also has no problems, the problem is the professional degree and job performance of the business staff."
The English translation for the sentence is: "It is recommended that the topic host comprehensively consider, in fact, many offline insurance intermediaries' products are more extensive, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products' cost performance is also better than online products."
"I have helped myself to assist 59 Internet customers, and I guarantee offline products. The fee for each person saves 2000-3000 yuan/year."
"If everyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me."
"I: Mingyuan Insurance Intermediary, with over 3 years of experience in corporate management training, have served over 1000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance purchase, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for the customer's individual needs. During the insurance purchase process, I will strive to negotiate the best possible insurance policy for the customer, and after the insurance purchase, I will help the customer make insurance policy arrangements, handle insurance premiums, and provide peace of mind for the customer."
"Grow together with each customer for a lifetime."
"I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic!"
According to the definition provided by the insurance regulatory department, insurance on the internet is the insurance business that the insured person can complete all the insurance procedures after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, the insurance agent does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured person on their own.
Although the insurance for the internet may not have much "ceremonial feeling" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this in no way affects the effectiveness and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This sentence can be translated to: "This pattern is somewhat similar to the general stream of work of 'telephone sales,' but buying insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the subsequent service may not keep up."
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several decades, when buying insurance, should we carefully consider the "intermediary" we choose, is it a "mediator" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services even after many years?
"How can I contact the delivery staff?"
"It's already 3 o'clock."
That is not to give me compensation.
The English translation for "我说要敲门送货" is "I said I want to knock on the door to send the goods."
But that rider was left at the door, and then everyone left.
