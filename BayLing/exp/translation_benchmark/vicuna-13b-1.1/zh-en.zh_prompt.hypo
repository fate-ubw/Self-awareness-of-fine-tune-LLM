Yesterday, reporters learned from the municipal education commission that starting this year, my city will pilot the "contracted talent cultivation model" in 60 vocational schools to cultivate talents under the model of "modern apprentices." The students who participate in the pilot cultivation will not only have the apprentice status but also have the right to apply for admission to the unit after being recruited.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, regulations for the recruitment and employment of part-time students by vocational schools must be standardized, clearly defining the dual identity of part-time students as both students and employees of enterprises, and adhering to the principle of two-way selection. The student, guardian, school, and enterprise must sign a tripartite agreement to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties. For part-time students under the age of 18 who have reached the age of 16, a four-party agreement must be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection of the part-time student during training and employment.
Encourage schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship format and collaborate with enterprises to provide on-the-job training and job transition training for employees.

According to the arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, my city determined to establish 60 city-level pilot points for modern vocational students, with each pilot group having around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students being trained.

South African doctor: Ebola has strong transmission power, but most are mild cases.
"Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delhi variant, although the transmission speed is faster."
According to a report by Bloomberg, as the COVID-19 outbreak spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in the South African province of Gauteng have reported to a medical organization that they are currently treating patients with relatively mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of influenza.
The general manager of the organization, Anban Pillay (Unben Pillay), said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but has not yet had any patients who needed to be hospitalized.
"皮莱说：“他们能够在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复。”"  翻译：  皮莱说：“他们能够在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复。”
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to contract severe illness due to COVID-19.
He said that, compared to the previous wave of COVID-19 patients, the SARS-CoV-2 patients he treated had "respiratory difficulties and low blood oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
"Other doctors also shared similar experiences within two weeks of reporting the first case of Omicron variant in southern Africa."
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the physician's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the past few weeks, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half the mortality rate of the first wave of the pandemic; the average hospital stay time decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in recent COVID-19 cases, only 3% died, while in early cases in South Africa, the mortality rate reached 20%.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "At present, almost all indicators point to this being a relatively warm disease."
He also said: "It's still early, we need to get more data from the future."
"Under normal circumstances, hospitalization and death usually occur late, and we have only entered this pandemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 stock in the world, cases of the Omicron strain are appearing in more than 10 countries, with South Africa as the center of the outbreak.
According to the introduction by health officials, the number of new cases of COVID-19 discovered in Wutong County in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were the Omicron variant.

"If the famous public service advertising slogan 'If you don't buy, you don't kill' is used as a reference, then in the absence of a 'collecting' requirement, the good environment of 'group defense, group treatment, and universal counter-collection' can make 'baiting' behavior unfavorable, the risk great, and the cost high, so this type of crime will not frequently occur."
Recently, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Bureau has launched an emergency platform for releasing information on missing children on its website.
This is to establish the authority channel for publishing missing child information and to create an internet platform for promptly finding and rescuing children who have been abducted.
"I heard that this App is called 'Circle' and it sounds warm and cozy."
The new technology means not only named "文艺" but also filled with affection, and effectively utilized in information application.
Enforce the law, the primary goal is to rescue the abducted child and ensure their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, it is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment to social prevention and legal education, can be listed with many "big words."
But before revealing the culprit in a hit-and-run case, priority should be given to ensuring the safety of the victim.
"事分轻重缓急，在急切的“寻救”目的之下，诸如“拐卖儿童是否应当一律死刑”之类众说纷纭、争议较大的话题，可以暂搁下来，谨慎讨论；但救助被拐儿童的事情等不得。"
According to the experience of handling this type of case, human traffickers tend to quickly leave the scene after completing the transaction.
Provide the following sentence's English translation: "Turning a blind eye to a child's misdeeds for a moment may lead them further away from their parents, making it harder to solve the case."
In this situation, taking action like the "Circle of Friends" platform can directly help solve the case and find the missing child, which is a practical solution.
"After all, 'to enforce the law' is a great task that requires the operation of the entire legal system."
"Protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of laws and regulations, to the guarantee of judicial justice, and the strict enforcement of the law, we must all embrace the spirit of 'nurturing the young and assisting the weak.'"
"Preventing child trafficking can be improved not only in the family but also in society."
A common example is that a family of three were resting at the train station and the parents fell asleep. When they woke up, they discovered that their child was missing.
"It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as the parents of a young child, they should at least have a corresponding awareness of protection."
"Parents taking turns to rest and placing the child in a safe and stable environment is the most effective means of preventing child abduction."
From the perspective of combating child abduction and trafficking crimes, it is also necessary to pay attention to and punish those who purchase children from traffickers.
"The single act of illegality is often only a link in the long chain."
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the statutory punishment for the crime of trafficking in children is five years' imprisonment. In cases where the circumstances are particularly serious, the punishment may be life imprisonment or death, and property may be confiscated.
"起刑点高、最高刑重，在"轻刑化"的大趋势下，拐卖儿童罪显然属于处罚较重的罪。"
"There are still many embezzlement cases occurring every year."
"It is clear that some people's views on bringing up children have fallen behind, and their legal awareness is thin."
Legal education for this group should keep pace with the times.
To effectively control fraudulent sales, it is not enough to rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
"If the phenomenon of 'market manipulation' is widespread, the manipulators will have a strong desire to profit, and will continuously innovate their manipulation methods, leading to a 'struggle' situation between the manipulators and the regulators, and the enforcement actions will inevitably become ineffective."
Therefore, eliminating the after-effects of watching pornography and promoting legal awareness can help prevent the sale and purchase of child pornography.

"From the ideal belief and initial mission, self-revolution and the great party of youth, the leadership of the party and the party's theory, Yang Hongdao comprehensively explained the core significance and practical requirements of the entire spirit of the conference through his personal experience and understanding."
He pointed out that we must combine the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the important instructions given by Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC, to criticize the "spirit" of the Two Sessions, strengthen the connection between the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Congress, and conscientiously study, publicize, and implement the important instructions of Xi Jinping.

We must conscientiously study, publicize, and implement the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the important instructions given by Xi Jinping,
In the interactive exchange segment, representatives of the base-level cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives discussed the relationship between the three historical decisions made by the base-level cadres, how to understand the decisive meaning of "two establishments," how cultural enterprises can seize the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Communist Party of China. Yang Hongdao answered these questions in plain language and with vivid examples, emphasizing the importance of learning from the hundred-year struggle history of the Communist Party of China, tightly uniting around the Communist Party Central Committee, and unwaveringly following the Party.

The International Olive Oil Council categorizes olive oil into two major categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil. There are also five levels within each category.
Virgin coconut oil, also known as natural coconut oil, is obtained by mechanically cold-pressing the fresh coconut fruit, followed by filtering to remove impurities.

"Special Virgin Olive Oil" translates to "Extra Virgin Olive Oil" in English.

The translation of the sentence "普通初榨橄榄油（Ordinary Virgin)" is:  "Ordinary Virgin Oil has a flavor and aroma that are acceptable, and its acidity does not exceed 3.3%."
Refined palm oil is obtained from crude palm oil that has a acidity level exceeding 3.3% through the process of refining, or it becomes "second oil."
Refined palm oil can be divided into two levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of unrefined olive oil, to balance the flavor and color, with a acidity level below 1.5%, appearing as a transparent yellow-gold color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: is obtained by extracting and refining olive pomace oil through a solvent method.
"You should have noticed by now, the acidity of rapeseed oil is a very important indicator."
"To know, grape juice is like brewing wine from grapes, coming from different grape-growing regions and different varieties of grapes, it will produce different standards of grape oil."

"Every year from 3 to 6 months, it is the time for the olive tree to bloom and bear fruit. From 7 to 10 months, the fruit begins to mature and ripen, turning from green to red, purple, and finally black."
The translation of the sentence "11月至次年2月是果实的采摘季节（橄榄油的新鲜度可是很重要的哦）" in English is:  "November to the following February is the best season for fruit picking (the freshness of pomegranate juice is quite important, you know)."
橄榄油的营养成分：
Palm oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid, palmitic acid, and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, and K, and antioxidants.
Palm oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among those discovered so far.
"The peak of democracy will fall, and it will be called the fire of freedom that never dies out."
The online "Summit for Democracy" concluded on Friday (December 10th) with the participation of government leaders from 110 countries, as well as civil society and private sector representatives, led by the President of the United States.

"Authoritarian power can never extinguish the spark of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all around the world."
The sentence can be translated to: "To defend democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society."
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democracy, promote reform, and achieve transparent accountability, which can resist the deceleration and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek to pursue power in the name of public interests."
"民主峰会"第二天的主题分别是保护人权，加强民主与对抗威权，以及反击数字威权主义与确认民主价值。
"Today is just in time for the 'International Human Rights Day'."
UN Secretary-General Guterres also expressed in his speech on the same day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as our commitment to democracy."
"This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing unequal issues, striking corruption, updating social contracts, investing in excellent education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls."
"This also requires resolutely criticizing all forms of nationalism, localism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technology revolution."
Hong Kong democracy activist Ronny Tong delivered a pre-recorded speech at the summit, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of the Uyghurs and Tibetans, as well as other ethnic minorities in China.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been rising with China, but there has never been a mechanism established to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and social leaders in the community must cooperate.
"We must utilize all resources at our disposal to ensure the resurgence of democracy is our top priority."
Ronald Reagan also called for the free world to unite and resist the threat of communism.
He said: "Maybe some people here are afraid of angering Xi Jinping, the General Secretary. Maybe some people here don't want to lose the Chinese market. Maybe some people here don't realize the threat that the Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
"And this is why we failed."
"This is also the reason why we must change it."
"Taiwan's Administrative Executive Yuan's Secretary-General, Tang Feng, attended the roundtable discussion on "Striking Against Digital Autocracy and Establishing Democratic Values," where he released the "National Declaration" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is on the front line in resisting authoritarianism and power."
He also shared his experience on how to build mutual trust through information transparency and fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said: "In the context of Taiwan's democratic development, we will always stand firm on the front line of opposing authoritarianism in the world, and we will play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
"During the pandemic, local governments in the name of public health and collective interest have been justifying the violation of individual rights, showing a reversed trend of democracy globally."
However, in Taiwan, we don't need to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't need to take down the mask to fight false information.

Last night, the Public Security Bureau of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou City, issued a statement to reporters from the New Beijing News, confirming that the police had identified the woman as the sister of the deceased who had made such a violent outburst, but such behavior was not worthy of promotion.

Here's the English translation of the sentence: "An article titled 'Quick Look! Project managers can knock out gold-plated projects' was very popular, mentioning that project managers in many projects can do everything at once, without anyone else being able to keep up: moving bricks, traveling, and staying up all night are the project manager's daily routine, while rescuing, frying up food, and apologizing are not even worth mentioning."
"A seemingly humorous article, yet it also speaks of the daily bitterness of project managers, representing a lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work."
"And those who work in project management are also gradually choosing to take some actions to extricate themselves from the difficulties in their work."
According to the number of people who have registered for the PMP (Project Management Professional) certification exam each year, more and more project management professionals are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "Chinese Project Management Professional (PMP) Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)": By September 2019, the total number of PMP® examination candidates in China had reached nearly 600,000, and the number of PMP® certified professionals was approximately 420,000. The number of effective PMP® certified professionals was approximately 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total global PMP® certified population.
"In the past decade, the number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers have realized that relying on past experience to do things is no longer effective, and the rapidly changing work environment requires us to learn how to adapt and explore new paths."
However, passing the PMP exam does not guarantee smooth project management work without obstacles, does it?
Many beginner project managers indicate that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the ten major areas and five major process groups of project management, but they still feel lost when actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often complain about the following issues: project management awareness is lacking, relying solely on personal experience, there is a lack of project management theory and practice, and don't know how to apply it; there is a lack of a systematic project management process system to support work, and it is difficult to get things done, project estimates are not accurate, and there is a lack of sensitivity in controlling the project, it is difficult to move forward. The division of labor is not clear, and there are "old veterans" in the team who do not know how to deal with cross-departmental communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance.

"This year's 'Double Eleven' online payment transaction volume nationwide reached 1.77 trillion yuan, breaking last year's record with innovative growth."
The sentence can be translated to:  With the arrival of the festive season, the variety of red envelopes has once again attracted the attention of consumers, and the live-streaming of goods has again made consumers excited about gaining benefits. This wave of consumption has made people marvel at the strength of national consumer spending, but it also requires us to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the influence of contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
Before the arrival of the "Double Eleven," Jiucheng Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Jiucheng") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the vast number of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumer consciousness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, up 2.04 from the previous year.
Generally speaking, the financial consumption level of our citizens is relatively good, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, which need to be further improved to raise the basic financial literacy level.

As a credit card financial institution, Jiexin has always devoted itself to providing excellent and sincere services to help the public build their own happy lives, advocating for consumers to establish a correct and positive consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of the regulatory authorities to improve the rational consumption awareness of young people in particular.
Over the past few years, Jiexin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities targeting the youth group including college students, and has guided the rational consumption needs of the young group through various forms of cooperation with domestic top universities, such as launching innovative practice competitions and so on, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, scientifically plan their consumption needs, and accumulate wealth for their lives.
"As the Double Twelve approaches, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a rational consumption consciousness and correct money views, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and to avoid the trap of consumer debt, in order to avoid affecting personal creditworthiness and future economic life."
"Consumption must be planned in advance, and efforts should be made to repay on time."
"If you miss the deadline, missing the deadline will be recorded in your credit report, which may negatively impact your ability to buy a car or a house in the future."
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose legitimate institutions and channels, and to check whether the relevant institution has obtained operating qualifications.
In the future, JD Finance will leverage its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated generational financial products to provide more personalized and diverse services to consumers, continuously helping the general public improve their financial literacy and encouraging consumers to cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing. JD Finance will become a reliable financial partner for consumers throughout their lives.

"越南人民报网 - Coastal Cooperation Commission to Address Common Challenges"
The stopovers of King Tutankhamun's travels include Amman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Worth noting is that this is Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a ban on Qatar in 2017, which led to a crisis in diplomatic relations in the region, and this is the first visit by King Mohammed VI of Morocco to Qatar since the ban was imposed.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a complete ban on its imports, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The tense external relations have had a severe impact on the internal cohesion of the sea conference, and have had a negative impact on the economy of the country in the region.

King Abdullah II of Saudi Arabia recently traveled to the coastal country to visit Iran and meet with leaders of major world powers to save the name of the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" (JCPOA) nuclear agreement with Iran - an agreement that some Gulf Arab countries criticized for not being able to solve the problem of Iran's ballistic missiles.
Each coastal country has long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear plan as a threat to regional security.
"Each coastal state believes that failing to resolve the Iranian missile issue and failing to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed."
"In the background of the multilateral nuclear talks with Iran failing to meet the expectations of the countries around the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations."
The goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
"This is one of the factors contributing to the National Bureau of Statistics of the State Council for promoting the economic growth of the coastal region."

"Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times."
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and value pursuits that a university has accumulated over a long period of time in its development process, which is the soul of the university.
"From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities has played an important role in the development of politics, economics, culture, science, and society, and has even been crucial to the progress of a nation."
Born in the first modern university in the world, the university shoulders a unique mission that is different from that of other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it was born in the autumn of the national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the impact of historical changes. It advocates the value concept of "promoting morality and prosperity" and takes on the responsibility of "loving the country and strengthening it."
"Currently, the trend of informationization and internationalization in higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, technology, and talent is becoming more and more intense. Higher education is an important "supply side" and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges."
The proposal of "Outline of the Plan for Accelerating the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" particularly highlights our country's confidence and determination to move from a strong country of higher education to a strong country of higher education. At the same time, it puts forward higher and more demanding requirements for the development of universities.
"How can we quickly catch up with the world's top universities and establish several world-class universities and academic disciplines in a short period of time, while still having a certain gap in our foundation? How can we achieve 'overtaking the curve'?"
In addition to goal-oriented self-confidence, path-oriented self-confidence, and ability-oriented self-confidence, colleges should fully utilize their three advantages: the advantage of being backward, the advantage of culture, and the advantage of system. The advantage of being backward is to continuously introduce outstanding international academic talents, learn from the advanced experience of world-renowned universities, and achieve significant improvements in academic level and quality. The advantage of culture is to inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization in five thousand years of accumulation, promote the development of excellent traditional culture, and concentrate strength, shape brand, and improve image. The advantage of system is to take advantage of the system superiority of socialist country, strengthen goal-oriented driving, gather consensus, optimize resource allocation, and provide sustainable guarantees for colleges to surpass the world's advanced level.
Please note that building a world-class university is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and each school must showcase its unique strengths and characteristics while competing for excellence.
The academic feature should not only have a common Chinese characteristic, but also demonstrate its own unique target positioning, academic tradition, and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we attach great importance to three aspects in our undergraduate education: one is highlighting the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talent, building a sci-tech talent cultivation system that combines education and research, and constructing an integrated talent cultivation ecosystem that spans the entire process of entrepreneurship education; the second is highlighting the academic interdisciplinary gathering characteristic, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the academic system, and creating an academic interdisciplinary environment that fosters the emergence of interdisciplinary new academic fields and significant interdisciplinary achievements; the third is highlighting the characteristic of the undergraduate system and social service, conducting in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of the Zhejiang University-based academic research cooperation system.
"In this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the spirit of the university, and to ensure that the university spirit resonates with the spirit of the times."
"For Zhejiang University, 'seeking innovation' is the school motto, and 'diligence, morality, clarity, and steadfastness' are the shared values, as well as the shared components of the latest expression of the Zhejiang University spirit, which includes 'nurturing the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River', 'adhering to the true and the good', 'pioneering and innovating', and 'strengthening the country through trees'."
This is a translation of the Chinese sentence:  这是学校坚持正确办学方向，不断积累文化高度、凝聚精神力量的重要保障，内涵丰富，意义深远。  Here's the English translation:  This is a guarantee of the school adhering to the correct educational direction, continuously accumulating cultural height and concentrating spiritual power, which is rich in connotation and profound in meaning.
"海纳江河" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, embodied in the selflessness of "serving the world with the best talents," and manifested as the pursuit of excellence in academic education; "启真厚德" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, implying that universities should not only pursue truth but also embrace moral and cultural cultivation; "开物前民" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, encompassing the pursuit of knowledge and scientific innovation, as well as the drive for reform and development; "树我邦国" emphasizes the patriotic dedication spirit, implying that universities should always be aligned with the destiny of the nation.
"This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is indeed the soul of the 120-year history of education at Zhejiang University."
"The wise hear silence, and the brilliant see the unformed."
"Chinese universities are further consolidating their position in advancing the cause of Chinese-style socialism, deeply grasping the historical mission and responsibility of higher education in the current era, and speeding up the construction of becoming a world-class university."
"At the same time, we must uphold humanistic care and independence, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation, mutually stimulate and inspire each other, and thus provide unceasing impetus for the realization of national strength and national rejuvenation, and the realization of humanity's common ideal."

"TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded 820 thousand US dollars, almost reaching 'King of Honor.'"
"On August 6th this year, the official Axie Infinity announced that the number of active users had exceeded 100,000."
"Axie Infinity" is introducing a new "play-to-earn" model that will be passed on to more people through blockchain and smart contract assistance. Instead of being a single character, players can not only gain enjoyment and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
"This sense of ownership is not conferred by the game creators, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology."

"Asian American groups file complaints against Yale, Stanford, and UC Berkeley for discriminating against them in admission."
Xinhua News Agency Beijing May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) On May 23, over 130 ethnic organizations in the United States submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, opposing the discrimination against Asian-American students by three universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admission process.
"The head of the overseas Chinese education alliance filed a complaint on the same day that a news conference was held in Washington."
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu, stated at the press conference that over the past decade, the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions for admission to Ivy League schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians at these three Ivy League schools has basically remained the same.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process of these universities, "long-term sustainability as well as systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" take place.
In 2014, according to Xu Qiang's introduction, research by scholars such as Zhang Dese showed that among the three universities, the admission rate for overseas students was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all schools in the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
"Zhao Yu tells reporters from Xinhua News Agency that they expect to submit the complaint and hope that the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans after determining the facts."
"They also hope that universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their recruitment policies for Asian students."
To date, no response has been made by the three universities accused.
The Asian American Educational Alliance was established in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admission process, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on the grounds of process.
This sentence can be translated to: "In addition to American Indian organizations, this complaint also involves American Indian, Indian, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations."

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Yueqing, Zhejiang, through a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Senior Lu purchased the details of buying the factory building from the owner of the building, Mr. Lin, through bargaining, and on the same day, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Lin signed as the payer on the 'Factory Building Sales and Purchase Agreement' in which it was stated that if the buyer did not wish to purchase the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not wish to sell the factory building, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. The two parties agreed to sign the 'Factory Building Sales and Purchase Agreement' within one week."
However, due to differences in opinions on the sale range and payment methods, among other major terms in the contract, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus, resulting in the delay in the signing of the real estate purchase and sale contract.
"Considering that the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, several days later, Lin delivered 200,000 yuan in deposit money back to the landlord."
It's not easy to see the house from the middle, the deposit has been paid and the mortgage is ready, but we signed the contract and the seller didn't sell it, which makes the landlord very unhappy.
"For this reason, Senior Lu will file a lawsuit against Lin at the People's Court of Yuyu City."
The court held that the two parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and it is not reasonable to hold only the defendant responsible. Therefore, the plaintiff should not be held responsible for double repayment of the deposit.
"After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed."
Recently, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the original judgment.
"Lawyer's reminder: It is important to exercise due diligence during the transaction process."
"When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should exercise due diligence and carefully consider your obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied or not, and clearly stating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes during performance of the contract."
"民主峰会"周五结束后，中国外交部发言人周六（12月11日）发表谈话表示，美国举办"领导人民主峰会"，是"以意识形态划线，把民主工具化、武器化，假民主之名行反民主之实，煽动分裂对抗，转移国内矛盾"。
The Chinese government believes that "in the long run, the United States will strengthen its political system and value concepts to the people, promote 'democratic reform,' abolish one-party dictatorship, and provoke 'color revolutions,' causing disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has already become a "massive destructive weapon" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
"This peak is a manifestation of the incumbent's campaign promise."
The two-day meeting will be conducted via video conference and will invite leaders from 111 countries around the world, including the leader of Taiwan, but not the leaders of China and Russia.
"As the G20 summit approaches, China and Russia are attacking the US for its own democratic problems, claiming that the US is not qualified to host such a summit."
There are also international and domestic voices of suspicion, such as criticism of inviting leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who some suspect may have attended the summit for geopolitical rather than democratic reasons.
The translation of the sentence "刚上任的德国总理肖尔茨也参加了视频民主峰会" in English is: "The newly appointed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also attended the Video Democracy Summit."
According to the statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Sunday, "The outbreak of the American-style democratic disease is particularly evident, with the issues of money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, ethnic conflict, and wealth polarization becoming more and more severe." The American democracy is built on the foundation of capitalism, which is referred to as the "rich man's game."
"As the leader of our government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, uphold the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and resist the erosion and impact of those who seek power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not something that comes naturally, "we must continuously update it in every generation, in my opinion, this is our critical challenge in this era."
"It is said that democracy and human rights around the world are facing a continuous and distressing challenge, and democracy needs champions to defend it."
"The United States has committed to taking action over the next year, including a proposed budget of $4.244 billion, to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media."
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned 2022 Democracy Summit.
"Let us all abide by our commitments and report our progress next year."
"Okay, I'm just afraid he might have gotten the address wrong."

"Educational thinking: How can college entrance exams make "study bullies" and "study slackers" each get what they deserve?"
Three students from Lanzhou University wrote a letter to the school leader, expressing their confusion about the university entrance examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the form of the examination questions, and make the examination truly reflect the students' actual abilities.
"Indeed, for a long time, college entrance exams have been a "hot topic.""
In the university campus, students come from the five lakes and the four seas, and their abilities vary, and furthermore, their learning levels are not the same, and the learning conditions are diverse.
"For groups with such diverse characteristics, there will inevitably be differing opinions."
"Of course, if the exam questions are all of the same type and repetitive, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably result in a completely different feeling."
"不用功的学生，可能考前集中突击就能及格，如果再想其他方法，有可能达到事半功倍的效果."
"学渣" 平时不投入也能过关、甚至得了高分； "学霸" 平时从不落课，作业、笔记样样好，考试也没高出多少的“怪现状”。
"It seems that the students of Lanzhou University are reflecting the problems that exist in college entrance exams, and it is not without cause. It is believed that such a situation is not only limited to Lanzhou University."
From the perspective of this layer of meaning, it is necessary to praise these three students for their academic achievements.
In fact, most people who have graduated from college are well aware of the situation, and there are various ways to "bribe" teachers to get exam questions, compete for exam subjects, and seek to get "special coaching" before the exam. It is not uncommon to see students carrying small cheat sheets or seeking help from teachers after the exam.
According to the author, as an evaluation direction of teaching quality, it is more concerned with the overall grasp of the teacher of teaching and learning, as well as scientific problems based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the specialty begins to specialize, and many specialized courses focus on fundamental knowledge.
"Do not be negligent in mastering the basic knowledge points of a subject, as this is what universities examine in entrance exams."
The basic knowledge of undergraduate education is mainly composed of the fundamental theories and basic common sense of the discipline, from the perspective of knowledge, the scope of change is not large, and the basic is relatively fixed.
"Just as the teacher said, '20 years ago, learning basic mathematical knowledge in college is still important today.'"
"But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and do not represent a single type of exam question or repeated test questions."
In many universities, exams are generally composed of question sets, which are then compiled by subject experts into test papers, and the exam papers are also reviewed by the entire faculty of the subject. This helps to avoid the problem of repeated questions to some extent.
To draft a set of test questions that are consistent with teaching and practical learning, the difficulty of the questions should follow a normal distribution, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and fully analyze the learning degree of the students in order to make the test questions cater to the difficulty and type of the questions. At the same time, the test questions should be able to reflect the basic knowledge of the students and also consider the ability examination. Innovative designs should be adopted for the question types.
"Examinations are the whip of university education, and what kind of examination it is, the students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the past, this has had an impact on the effectiveness of university education."
For the student's recommendation letter, Jiaozuo University highly values and has already implemented a comprehensive reform plan throughout the school.
"Require each educational unit to organize teachers to conduct a seminar and final examination self-inspection, formulate the examination question paper and relevant systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination question paper and review process. At the same time, improve the grading system and strengthen the comprehensive inspection of various teaching and learning processes."
Solving the problems of single-type exam questions and repeated exam questions from the mechanism is one of the issues that universities need to address in their exams. Of course, appropriate systems need to be put in place, but the key lies in the teacher's comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It is not enough to simply understand the content of the curriculum; the teacher must also understand the learning situation of the students. Only by "eating through" both the teaching content and the learning situation of the students can the teacher and students form a positive interaction and make the exam more in line with reality. In this way, both "study bullies" and "study slackers" will benefit.

"3,200 newborn babies in Shaba without birth certificates due to special anti-forgery paper shortage."
"Saba News" reported that the registration office in Saba said that due to the use of light to prevent the issuance of birth certificates to newborns, they have not been able to issue birth certificates to newborns since October, and the number of people affected has reached 3200.
However, the responsible person at the local office, Kyle Aimes, guarantees that all babies who have already applied for a birth certificate, their information has already been recorded in the system, and it will be supplemented when the fake birth certificate is sent out next week.
"他在新闻发布会上，对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导进行解释。"
He said that the problem had arisen two months earlier and that Escalade was also facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the production of anti-counterfeit paper by Chinese factories has been affected by the pandemic, resulting in a delay in shipment to our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by Shaba paper is different from that used in other areas, so it cannot borrow stock from other provinces.
Kjell Aamodt revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has already been shipped to Johor Bahru on June 6th and will be handed over to the printing company for partial printing work on June 8th.
The translation of the sentence is: "The office will send someone to Johor Bahru to pick up goods next week on Thursday and immediately proceed with the final stage of printing upon return to Sandakan, estimating that it will take more than 2 working days (12/20) to complete and deliver to the applicant."
"We will notify applicants to go to the respective local offices to pick up the admission notice."

People's Daily commentator: "The '14th Five-Year Plan' has made a good start with a focus on study and learning in the central economic work conference - Xinhua Net."
"新华社北京12月11日电，人民日报12月12日评论员文章：“十四五”实现良好开局——论学习贯彻中央经济工作会议精神。"
"Achieved a good start in implementing the '14th Five-Year Plan'." The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly evaluated the achievements of the economic and social development of the country over the past year.
President Xi Jinping delivered a significant speech at the meeting, comprehensively summarizing the economic work in 2021, deeply analyzing the current economic situation, and issuing major deployments for economic work in 2022, which will help us prepare for the upcoming economic work and welcome the convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The speech pointed out the direction for progress and provided the fundamental guidelines for compliance.
"We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, officially declaring the establishment of a moderately prosperous society, achieving the first centenary goal, launching the comprehensive construction of a socialist modern country, and embarking on the new struggle to achieve the second centenary goal."
"We are holding the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, summing up the great achievements and historical experiences of the hundred-year struggle of the Party, and through the third historical decision of the Central Committee of the Party on the great achievements and historical experiences of the hundred-year struggle, this is a political declaration of the Communist Party of China in the new era, which is to remember the original aspiration, be steadfast in the mission, and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is a guide for action to verify and create the future, achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
In the past year, there have been unprecedented major changes and the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, making the external environment even more complex and challenging. The tasks of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting economic and social development are particularly arduous.
"The Central Committee of the Party, with Xi Jinping as its core, adheres to the principle of focusing on the two major issues of domestic and foreign affairs, adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, adheres to the overall plan for preventing and controlling the epidemic and promoting economic and social development, accelerates the construction of a new development framework, strengthens cross-period macro policy adjustment, and makes every effort to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the economy while promoting reform, innovation, and opening up. The Party and the country have achieved new significant achievements in various fields."
"The '14th Five-Year Plan' has achieved a good start, with one important aspect being demonstrated in the construction of a new development layout, which has taken a new step forward and achieved new results in high-quality development."
"我国经济发展和疫情防控保持全球领先地位，发展韧性强、潜力大、动力足的特点持续显现；国家战略科技力量加快壮大，重大创新成果竞相涌现，科技创新能力持续提升，关键核心技术攻关实现新突破；产业链韧性得到提升，对外贸易量增质升，结构继续优化，以新产业新业态新模式为代表
"The achievements obtained are the result of the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the result of the scientific guidance of the new era of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, and the result of the tireless efforts and solidarity of the entire Party, the entire country, and all ethnic groups of the people."
"Practice again confirms, the Communist Party of China Central Committee established Xi Jinping's core status, the core status of the entire party, established the guiding position of Xi Jinping's new era of Chinese socialism, and has decisive significance in promoting the development of the new party and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
With Xi Jinping as the core of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the guiding force of the entire Party, and with the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era as the scientific guidance, and with the entire Party and all ethnic groups of the Chinese people united and strong, we will certainly be able to overcome various difficulties and obstacles and create new brilliance and forge new historical achievements in the great struggle to build a modern socialist country.
"Next year, the 20th National Congress of the Party will be held, which is a major event in the political life of the Party and the country."
"Propagate the great spirit of the Communist Party, adhere to the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, comprehensively, accurately, and fully implement the concept of the new development, accelerate the construction of the new development layout, continue to deepen reform and opening up, adhere to innovation as the driving force for development, promote high-quality development, adhere to the supply-side structural reform as the main line, coordinate epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, coordinate development and security, continue to do a good job of "six stability" and "six protection" work, and continue to improve people's lives, so that the big picture of the economy remains stable, social harmony is maintained, and the political environment remains clean and positive."
Let us more closely unite around Comrade Xi Jinping at the core of the Central Committee, strengthen the "Four Consciousnesses," consolidate the "Four Confidences," do the "Two Maintenances," and continuously improve our political judgment, political awareness, and political execution, so as to implement the decisions of the Central Committee and achieve the goals of the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

"48 hours of negative neutrality, set up a 'buffer zone' National Defense and Joint Control Mechanism document requires strengthening of border city epidemic prevention and control - Xinhua Net"
"Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporter: Deng Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The National Defense and Military Commission recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in border cities, requiring personnel to leave the mainland within 48 hours after arriving at border cities (except for Hong Kong and Macao) and provide a negative COVID-19 test result. Those who arrive in mainland border cities must undergo a COVID-19 test within 24 hours after arrival."
According to the notice, the time range for meeting the above requirements will be determined from each province, city, and municipality, and announced starting from the day after the announcement.
In addition, the notice also stated that conditionally, cities near the mouth of a river may be studied for setting up an epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within the administrative region.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission introduced, for some cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the two sides' residents frequently come and go.
"Implementing differentiated management policies, a single border defense line becomes two, potentially achieving herd immunity, compressing the risk of the epidemic, and minimizing social impact and cost to achieve the maximum effect of controlling the epidemic."
Recently, there have been multiple outbreaks of local cluster diseases in our country, which are all caused by the entry of foreign epidemic diseases into border cities.
The above notice points out that there are some problems with the monitoring and early warning of the epidemic, such as delayed and inadequate management of high-risk personnel, incomplete implementation of closed-loop management, irregularities in periodic acid testing, inadequate disposal of cold chain items, improper management of concentrated isolation sites, and inadequate emergency response measures.
The notice requires us to strengthen the prevention and control mechanisms, healthy epidemic monitoring and warning systems, and border control measures in nine areas, including completing the construction of urban and rural epidemic prevention and control systems, improving the weak links in the prevention and control of urban and rural areas, accelerating the filling of gaps in the prevention and control of urban and rural areas, and doing a good job of scientific and precise prevention and control work, tightly sealing the external input prevention line.
"It is emphasized to remind all coastal cities to coordinate research and deployment of epidemic prevention and livelihood protection work, publicize and operate the livelihood protection hotline, periodically inspect the supply and prices of basic living items, and proactively solve and respond to prominent problems reflected by the masses."

Color: As in a photograph (avoid shooting with a color difference, the closest color to the object will be the most accurate, and the outdoor lighting will cause the color of the clothing to become brighter, and the color problem should be consulted before purchasing).
"This product is vintage. The first buyer of vintage products is requested to search for 'vintage' or 'antiques' on Baidu."
The English translation of "孤品" is "solitary item."
"It is inevitable for antique clothing to have some minor flaws, so if you decide to purchase antique clothing, you should mentally prepare for this. If you are a perfectionist and are particular about flaws, I will describe them in detail. This is a characteristic of antique clothing, and whether you think it's good or not is a different matter altogether!"
"The store's policy is that they do not accept returns on antique products."
So-called vintage, design will always have a sense of retro, that is, nostalgia. The reason why people like vintage is because they like its sense of age and its texture!
Therefore, individual girls who are not suitable for driving should not say that their clothes are old-fashioned, but should say that they are not suitable for you!
"There is no such thing as a risk-free frugal person, online shopping carries risks, and careful shopping is needed."
"If the item is not suitable for the buyer due to their own reasons such as not liking it, they can negotiate with the store owner to take it off the shelf and resell it. Once it is sold, there will be no refund or exchange. Please cooperate with each other!"
The English translation of the sentence "2021.6.11部分圈中售出" is "Part of the circle was sold out on June 11, 2021."

"Know what to buy"
"The products sold at this store are non-refundable."
"Please take a few minutes to read this guide before purchasing."
"All products in this store may have a slight color difference due to the display and lighting, and we do not accept any color difference as a reason for returns or exchanges. Please carefully consider your purchase before making it, as color differences are not considered a reason for complaints or returns."
"This store does not accept what is imagined to be different, and the style of the product is not suitable as a reason for returning and exchanging."
"Size is always measured from the flat surface of the object, and there may be errors, but we are confident in the accuracy of our measurements. If you receive a size that is not suitable, it cannot be exchanged, so it is important to carefully consider it beforehand."
"If you have any problems, please contact me immediately. I will carefully solve them, and if there is any malicious criticism, I will definitely report it to the bottom."
"Everything that is sent out before we will carefully check the quality, there will be no problem."
"After receiving the clothes, please confirm receipt within 48 hours and give a rating. We understand our difficulties."
"Oil pipeline video starts at the beginning of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing - Xinhua Net"
"The video source is the oil pipeline."
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machines" on the oil platform drew widespread attention.
This sentence describes a film that tells the story of the United States launching the "War on Terror" and forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, which lasted for 20 years and saw poorly-equipped soldiers committing atrocities and committing various crimes against humanity.
"Abusing drones to invade hospitals, schools, and other public places, distort human nature, and establish murder groups."
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghans.
"The US military set up a "black jail" to impose various cruel punishments and humiliations on "suspects.""
"一桩桩反人类罪行激起更多阿富汗人的仇恨."
As the video says, the American "anti-terror" war is becoming increasingly terrifying.
"War has not brought peaceful democracy and prosperity to the Afghani people, it has only brought a country full of landmines and endless killing and destruction."
"Bite the video, let us together uncover the truth of "terror" in the United States, reveal the bloody killings, and expose the false facade of American democracy!"
By chance, I came across an article discussing why a customer would want to hire a logistics company in a tax-free zone to package their products, even though packaging is considered a deep processing operation and does not fall within the operational scope of tax-free logistics companies. This article may provide some explanation for why the customer wants to do this.
"I have visited many dairy factories and have been in contact with many dairy production lines."
In fact, the raw materials for packaging and listening are the same, without any difference.
Then everyone will ask: Why is the warranty period for appliances longer than that for clothes?
"Or alternatively, ask: Why is the price difference between hearing aids and hearing aids so large?"
"In fact, many consumers, or even some mothers, believe that this is because the raw materials are not the same, so the quality will be much better."
"Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that the expensive ones are good."
"There are also consumers who, because of this mindset, have eaten the post-reaction and said the taste is not the same as what they heard!"
"Now I want to tell you the reason why it's expensive, where is the costly part?"
"Why do they have such a large price difference even though their raw materials are the same?"
"Because most manufacturers consider that if the packaging cost is too high, consumers will find it hard to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profits are low or even non-existent. So how do manufacturers survive?"
So they had a significant increase in pricing power to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most factory owners prefer to install hearing aids, rather than earplugs.
"There's also the fact that you want so many factories to spend so much on advertising every year, even tens of millions or even billions, where does this cost come from?"
The English translation of the sentence "大家可想而知" is "Everyone knows it."
With the development of society, the cost of market promotion, such as mall promoters, display fees, product giveaway costs, and advertising fees, is constantly increasing.
Therefore, each factory is constantly launching new products, and they are all customized, and their prices are also constantly increasing. In fact, this is due to the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, and the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "There is also a part of the brand that, in order to promote their products, does not hesitate to use any means, and cooperates with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, earning profits of up to 80 yuan from a single prescription."
"However, Chinese relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operating methods, and in fact, such acts are harmful to consumers."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "It is recommended to purchase packaged milk powder and pour it into a container under the condition of having a container at home, which can save costs while increasing the preservation and sealing properties of milk powder and having no impact on children."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Please don't think that the warranty period of hearing aids is longer than that of wax earplugs. If the warranty period of hearing aids and wax earplugs is the same after opening the package, it's just that wax earplugs are not easy to preserve after opening the package and are prone to deterioration."
"Dinner is delayed and the food is all cold. Cold food is dry and hard to eat."
"And soup has spilled out."
"立即取消，他 #PRS_ORG# 补送来的东西肯定都凉了."
"I haven't taken it yet!"
"NAME" said that you guys didn't send anyone to pick up.
"We called each other on the phone in the past."
"If you don't repay the loan, I will report you to the police."
"Multiple uses of #PRS\_ORG# today, but this is the worst experience so far."
"Completely unable to accept."
好的，可以。
"But also remind the restaurant and the riders."
"Prevent it from happening again in the future."
"I would like to know the exact delivery time."
"That time is constantly being delayed."
"Don't know when to wait for what."
"If the order is cancelled, can we get our money back?"
"How do I pay for the bike rental service fee?"
"It has already been confirmed that there is a cyclist."
"No longer willing to wait."
"Don't push people to the starting line."
"Browsing in a book market often allows you to feel the explosion of successful academic books."
Many successful self-help books today promote the idea of "best principles" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" before telling you what you need to do to succeed.
It can be translated as "Finally, it comes down to the most fundamental and crucial question of how to do it."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Therefore, all these books have a common characteristic - either you do it well or you don't do it at all; either you're 100 or you're 0; either you climb Mount Tai or you do nothing."
"This 'best principle' allows anyone to acknowledge that it is 'absolutely correct', but 99% of people will be knocked over before the starting line."
This sentence can be translated to: "This theory advocates for a 'you need to have a determined heart, remake yourself, and make a 180-degree turn' path, which is unfortunately a fatal weakness for many people."
For those who insist on adhering to the rules, following the old ways, and resisting change, you might want to shout in their ears, "You need to change!" It's likely that you're just fooling yourself and others.
Most people will reveal their fear and hesitation before the words "turning point," covering their feet and lacking determination. Or, relying on a momentary surge of pain, they bravely make the first step, but often the outcome is short-lived, and they can't sustain it for long. It's rare to see persistence.
The famous passage from Mao Zedong's "From Tomorrow On" that has been widely circulated, is a classic representation of the "universal human nature."
"最好原则"的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹”。
"Perhaps the 'second-best principle' is a path that more ordinary people can follow to achieve relative success."
"The core of the principle of 'second best' is to 'lower the threshold.' It encourages a theory of 'small wins lead to big wins,' that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you don't climb to the top of Mount Tai, it's okay to only climb to the top of your front door's small sand dune, because that's stronger than staying at the original place."
The English translation of the sentence is: "Anything you do is better than doing nothing."
The translation of the sentence is:  "Because the threshold has been lowered greatly, it has become easier for ordinary people to persist, and even if they just persist, their success probability will increase."
"However, the path to success following the "second-best principle" is relatively short."
In summary, the "best principle" may sound on the surface like a flag that can make everyone successful, but ultimately, it can only motivate a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and maximize the benefits for as many people as possible.

"The amount of blue crab resources on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Net."
Xinhua News Agency in Qinghai on December 11 reported (by reporter Liu Chunfeng and Zhang Hongyong) that the latest monitoring results show that the quantity of scallops in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million kilograms this year, reaching 10.85 million kilograms, which is an increase of 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The Chinese phrase "青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼”" refers to a rare and valuable species of fish found only in Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological security and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the human activities such as large-scale killing and promiscuous breeding caused the environment in the lake to deteriorate, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of sturgeon in Lake Baikal. In 2002, the amount of sturgeon resources stored in Lake Baikal was only 2,592 tons.
"2004 in the 'Red List of Endangered Species in China', the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as a critically endangered species."
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of stocking fish in closed waters, prohibiting any unit, group, or individual from catching grass carp in Qinghai Lake and its major tributaries and tributaries. The sale of grass carp and its products is also prohibited.
At the same time, by means of artificial breeding and the release of cultured fish, as well as the construction of scientifically designed "fish passages" and other measures, the protection force has been continuously strengthened, and the amount of aquatic resources in the naked sturgeon has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, vice director of the Agricultural Bureau in Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, the artificial breeding and release of grass carp in Qinghai Lake has reached 1.8 million, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the restoration of the grass carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
"The source areas of the three rivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are an important ecological barrier and water source in China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east and plays an important ecological role."
"To protect the ecological environment in the source areas of the Three Rivers, the Qinghai Lake water area, and to protect aquatic wildlife, to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year, the Yangtze, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake have successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in the key water areas, and established a comprehensive prohibition on fishing management system for each river and lake."

Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Enlighten a man on general knowledge."
Most girls will experience their first menstrual period between the ages of 13 and 15, and will menstruate regularly until around the age of 50.
"After ensuring good health, it will come more or less regularly every month."
But it's not always accurate to predict exactly, with a margin of about a week, and you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes the weather can also be unpredictable and change unexpectedly, sometimes even several days earlier.
The length of time, amount of blood, and severity of pain vary from person to person, with some people recovering in three days and others taking a week; some people have little bleeding, while others have a lot; some people have no reaction, while others are in such pain that they have to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The severity of pain changes with time, and just because someone is not in pain now does not mean they will not be in pain later.
"The moon is unable to control it, and the bleeding lasts for 24 hours within a few days, the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary napkins to prevent blood from flowing onto the chair."
The main cause of menstrual pain is the release of prostaglandins, which occurs at the beginning of the menstrual period and can be relieved by eating ibuprofen before the onset of menstrual pain. After the onset of menstrual pain, eating nothing is effective.
Before menstruation, due to the filling of the uterus and the release of progesterone, it is easy to bloating.
"If it's almost time for the period, it's probably PMS, and you'll probably get your period within two days."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "It is best to change the sanitary towel twice or three times a day, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Except for sleeping time, the worst situation is to change six times a day for one day, which is 42 pieces. If you prepare some in advance, there may be 50 pieces, and it is not necessary to use one piece every month."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "It is not necessary to frequently change the sanitary pads, changing them about once every five to six hours is sufficient. It is recommended not to use them for more than eight hours."
"月经期荷尔蒙作祟可能会比较暴躁，排卵期也会因为体内激素变化情绪不稳定，就是很倒霉，身体给自己使绊子。"
However, official crime rate data can show that women have a high ability to control their emotions, and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
"流的并不只是血，其中包含脱落的子宫内膜."
Provide an English translation for the following sentence: "After the end of the lunar month, the innermost layer of the uterus becomes the thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus being a house. Each month, the house is built (the uterine lining thickens) to prepare to welcome guests, but if no guests come, everything is dismantled (the moon discharges) the next month and a new house is built."
"The moon is not convenient, continuing for several decades, each month several days and 24 hours of bleeding, and also stomach and back pain, who would want it?"
However, people can be born because their mothers have gone through menstruation, and menstruation is to prepare a house for you to live in for ten months when you first come to this world. We should all thank our mothers for their healthy menstrual cycles.
Translation: In the past, many things that women did were suppressed, society told women that it was shameful and embarrassing, and everyone believed it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone thinks the moon is wicked and believes that a woman's body prepares for pregnancy with a wicked intention, they should not speak out in public, and young girls should not think this way. They have never experienced it and will not experience it. Such men do not know how to repay kindness and do not know how to be grateful. How can they face their own mothers and want their own children?
"Finally, let's try the sanitary pads, they are really good."
"Today is Winter Solstice, and the mistakes are relatively disappointing."
"Would you like to order some food for your child to eat?"
"I hope that everything in the store is checked thoroughly."
Is it possible that the bubbles in the foot bath are caused by electrical leakage?
"Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can play a good role in foot care, and today, we at China Beauty Collective will provide an answer to this problem. We hope it will be helpful to our friends."
With the increasing awareness of people's health, foot baths have become more and more popular among consumers, and a variety of products have flooded the market, ranging from dozens to hundreds of yuan, providing consumers with a broad selection.
In related product markets, compared to traditional household appliances, the sales of healthcare-related household appliances such as bathroom basins are skyrocketing, but bathroom basins do not have specific industry standards, which poses a certain safety risk.
"Swimming with electric eels, isn't that dangerous?"
"Li Shifu told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but when his father used it, he felt a burning sensation on his feet."
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't turn off the vibration function, and his father still felt a strange sensation on his feet.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Mr. Li tested the electric pen, and to his surprise, the water in the bathtub was electrified."
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he had to give up the bathtub. Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
"Because he discovered that this already popular bathtub has no clear, detailed industry regulations in terms of its highest temperature setting, applicability to what kind of population, what kind of material guarantees safety."
However, in general, a bathtub is not prone to electrical problems, but there is no guarantee that a small number of products may not have been manufactured with strict quality control.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a body-jetting bathtub.
"Water and electricity separation, no safety concerns."
"You can take the electrical pen test at any time."
"The opening of the 13th Tea Expo in Hunan - News headlines - Hunan Daily Net - Hua Speak Online"
The Hunan Daily reported on December 10 that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Products Introduction Conference was held this morning at the Hunan International Expo Center, showcasing the tea industry, promoting tea science and technology, propagating tea culture, and accelerating the realization of the target of the tea industry.
The Vice President of the China National Supply Chain Cooperative Association, Yu Sunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Honghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of lake red and the rising of red tea have injected new vitality into "Five-Color South Tea".
"In recent years, the provincial government has given strong support to the development of the tea industry, and has pushed forward the construction of the "Three Rivers and Four Waters" tea industry, forming a development layout."
"Strengthen innovation in the tea industry in the province, and increase the popularity of green tea, black tea, and red tea. The tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, leading to increased income for tea farmers."
"Feng shui revolves, tea also becomes strong."
Local tea experts say that after picking green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income in all four seasons, and the value of tea gardens continues to rise.
At the opening ceremony, the head of the province authorized the fourth batch of enterprises to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and welcomed the new era of "Hunan Red."

"Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world."
The Chinese phrase "形而上学" comes from "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in the "系辞上传" of the Yi Jing. It was translated into metaphysics by the Japanese philosopher Inazo Nitobe (during the Meiji era).
The branch of metaphysics includes theories of substance, natural theology, and related issues.
The translation of the sentence "本体论就是“研究到底哪些名词代表真实的存在实体，哪些名词只是代表一种概念”。" in English is "The theory of ontology is to study "to what extent which nouns represent real existence entities, and which nouns only represent a concept.""
"Formal ontological naturalism, which denies the existence of God."
The theoretical basis for believing that all phenomena can be explained by natural causes was proposed by philosophers who support the scientific and evolutionary theories.
The method of natural theology is a method of studying God without mentioning His name.
"Mental philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of the relationship between consciousness and the physical body, especially the brain."
Binary theory and monistic theory are the two main schools of thought for discussing the relationship between "mind and body."
"Philosophy of knowledge is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge."

"Now, most of the orphans' parents have passed away, and the orphans have already grown up and started working."
"Can you help us, these difficult families have passed through the most difficult times."
"Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing chaos globally, and most donors have already reached retirement age."
Therefore, I humbly request that you stop labeling us as "Tiananmen Mother" donors, as this charitable assistance activity should have already reached its perfect conclusion.
I will forever cherish your love, and I am confident that your dedication will be recorded in history.
"Due to various reasons, I can only express my intention in this way. Please understand, friends!"
"Please accept my sincere congratulations."
Ceramic Industry: Please allow me to briefly introduce the history of the 32-year humanitarian assistance to the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minneapolis China Democracy Fund (MCDF) from a people-oriented perspective.
During the process of practicing humanism rescue, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Minnesota China Democracy Fund are parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Apple Daily news graphic: The 'Mother of Taiwan' website is managed by the pottery industry."
The sentence can be translated to: "Relief funds often cannot be smoothly delivered to the hands of the recipients."
In 1994, under the guidance of Ding Laoshi, a special group called "Tiananmen Mothers" was established to take charge of receiving and distributing donations for the rescue effort.
In 1998, MCDF established the "Six Four Orphan Education Fund," which was executed 11 years later in 2009. After all the Six Four Orphans graduated from university, MCDF established the "Six Four Orphan Poverty Relief Fund" and has been executing it until today.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from donations from alumni and social donations in the year of 1989, as well as from the generosity of individual donors and the support of the Democratic Fund of Tsinghua University Alumni Association.
"Since 2018, it has received support from the Labor Research Fund."
"直到去年，时隔31年后，六四难属们终于收到了一笔来自香港的当年以六四的名义募捐来的部分捐款."
During this period, "China Human Rights" was also carrying out its independent human rescue project.
We understand that Professor Ding asked to stop the donation is for the consideration of the donors, and we are indeed all retired old people who do not have an income as good as before retirement. Therefore, we especially express our gratitude to Professor Ding's letter to thank the donors.
"We will respect the decision of those involved and end this project within two years, and restore it as needed."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "We express our gratitude and respect to those who have been persistently devoted to philanthropy for many years, taking risks to deliver aid to those in need, and those brave and generous individuals who have always stood by our side."

"If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have that idea, it's better to self-study because training requires a lot of money and takes six months to learn."
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with low self-control.
"If you have a strong self-study ability, you can choose to self-study, but it will be quite tiring."
"Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important matter."
First, let's look at the human resources of this organization. If the human resources are not strong enough, this training organization has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training organizations may not have particularly strong human resources.
"Before choosing, it's best to investigate this training organization. It's a good idea to investigate the organization's students, after all, only the organization's students know the true nature of the organization, and can speak about the quality of the courses."
"Hello, to be honest, I'm not sure how to answer your question because I haven't introduced myself to you, and there is a strong relationship between learning this and your personal situation."
For example, professional background, age, language learning goals, even the city where you want to study, all of these are related to your field of study or the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated, or if you have already graduated from a computer science program, I recommend self-study if you have the time. This is the most cost-effective and efficient option, and there are many online and offline training institutions that are not bad. However, the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large. In general, it takes about 3-6 months to concentrate on training.
However, if I were to say the same things, self-study would be very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources online, or there are many training resources at B stations. If you don't find resources, you can also introduce me and get free resources, or detailed consultation is also available.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video-based learning.
If you are not a computer science major but are willing to invest in learning costs and time, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much money, and the teachers' explanations are very detailed. There are also people who specialize in answering questions, and in addition to learning planning or supervision, there is also help.
"Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment contracts, with a quota for internal recommendations. After studying, they recommend students to companies, so the interview process for finding a job afterward can save a lot of trouble."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "That's all I have to say on the matter. I only briefly introduced the topic because I don't know your situation, so it wasn't detailed.

The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, and some artists use recycled materials to create new works, such as Xu Bein in her series 'Behind the Scenes: A Mountain Landscape' (2014), who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials."
Diriye Double Year Expo Chief Executive Officer Bakili expressed his hope that this year's Double Year Expo could establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural and creative industry of Saudi Arabia and its innovative community, and strengthen interaction between the two.

"Yunnan: Regulating the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Villages - Xinhua Net"
Xinhua News Agency in Kunming on December 12 reported (by reporter Lin Bifeng) that continuous efforts are being made to help poor people find jobs and consolidate the results of poverty alleviation. Earlier, Yunnan Province issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas to promote the development of rural areas. These efforts are aimed at promoting the overall development of rural areas.
The People's Association of Yunnan Province has introduced a person in charge, and currently, Yunnan has established 44.83 million village public service positions to help place the impoverished labor force and other rural difficulty groups in employment, which has played an important role in assisting the impoverished population to achieve employment income growth, consolidate poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
This regulation is jointly issued by the Cloud Native People's Association, the Office of Rural Revitalization, the Ministry of Finance, and other six departments, which mainly aims to standardize the recruitment, fund management, job position development, and job position management of grass-roots public welfare personnel in rural areas.
In terms of position development settings, the new regulations stipulate that position development should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "on-demand development, designated personnel, dynamic management, and quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person one position, voluntary publicity, and unified management."
The recruitment process should follow the steps of announcement, application, review, announcement, employment, pre-employment training, and arrangement of on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing village public service positions, the standards for subsidizing village public service positions, and the methods for subsidizing village public service positions. The regulations also stipulate that each department responsible for developing village public service positions should purchase accidental injury insurance for the personnel assigned to these positions, and that relevant departments should regularly monitor the situation of subsidies for village public service positions.

"I reorder."
"Has it been canceled?"
"Although the right-wingers have had their moments in history, they don't last long. It's because they're easily swayed by a little sunshine or a sip of water, and they quickly perspire. If they're a little more accommodating, they can see far and wide, but they'll inevitably be attacked by the opposition."
"But in reality, the right-wing has played a positive role in the progress of society."
"From ending the cultural revolution and defining the truth standard, developing the economy, promoting science and technology, and improving the political system and protecting human rights, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied."
As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with Li Weidong's views, I am interested in his views and respect Li Weidong as a person. This is because he is diligent and pays attention to China, and also takes a serious view of China's social issues.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I believe that revolution is necessary, revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's lives will be affected, political parties will be in disorder, and foreigners will take advantage of the chaos.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Fourthly, in order to change or improve China, we need to have patience and take responsibility for the country and the people, rather than being a political opportunist who only cares about personal gain."
"Let's talk more."
"Left, in fact, is a scapegoat of time and politics."
"If the right is said to have a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will still listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary. However, the left cannot do this, because the left only wants what the Communist Party has discarded!"
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Recently, I saw some friends who were either slandering or criticizing others, and they were quite passionate about it. I don't think it's necessary to take it to such an extreme."
"Don't try to reason with a hooker or a leftist, they're both as stubborn as a mule."
"Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about trying to get the opposition and the left to acknowledge it. Why bother?"
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "I tell my friends: when anti-rightists criticize you for being five hairs off, when leftists criticize you for being a rightist dog, just barely prove that our middle path is correct!"
"Many people have ideals in their youth, but as they grow older, they forget their ideals or pursue them, but end up being biased."
"Ideals gradually recede into the distance, and even a young dragon may ultimately become an evil dragon."
"左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。"  "Generally, 'left' and 'right' refer to constraints and freedom. From the genes of Chinese history and culture, the overall direction of China should be to the left."
While domestic right-wing forces prioritize freedom, efficiency, and development, left-wing forces strengthen regulation, and prioritize fairness and safety.
"Nowadays, the general public places more emphasis on fairness, while the Sino-US conflict continues. It is certain that the bias towards the left will persist for a long time."
"Even though I don't understand, just give me a thumbs up and we're done."
"What's the use of talking, flowers are just like that."
For the past two years, the US's embargo and blockade of Huawei chips have not only caused Huawei to face unprecedented difficulties, but also led to huge losses for "US-style" companies.
"美帝压力中国芯片产业，要求自家企业及盟友国相关企业同时对我国芯片产业进行封锁，直接导致的后果就是全球芯片供应商的订单和利润受到影响，造成芯片生产企业的研发投入降低、产能下降，从而造成了全球范围内芯片供应链的短缺的紊乱。"
"缺芯" has already affected major industries around the world, such as the automotive industry's production suspension and the increase in the price of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use semiconductors have been affected by the shortage.
"In order to grasp the 'semiconductor' self-sufficiency, more and more technology giants in various countries are moving towards a 'domestication' path."
To tightly control the global semiconductor industry and control the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has frequently taken actions recently, and hosted the "Semiconductor Summit" and invited 64 heads of state to establish a semiconductor alliance to support domestic US technology giants, such as inviting Intel, the US technology giant, to invest $200 billion to build a second semiconductor wafer manufacturing plant in the US state of Arizona and open up its semiconductor foundry business to the outside.
It is widely believed that Intel's latest move will have a significant impact on Taiwan's electronics industry and may even snatch away Taiwan's "rice bowl."
The reason why this is so certain is because Intel, as a leading technology giant of the American Empire, has been deeply cultivating in the semiconductor field for over thirty years and has a large pool of talented personnel and technological reserves, which guarantees that it can rapidly rise up and defeat TSMC in a short period of time.
However, for Edison's decision, Tesla's founder Nikola Tesla did not care less.
"At the 2021 Mastermind Summit held in April, Zhang Zhihuan made a surprising statement, expressing his views on Intel's plan to build a diamond wafer factory. Zhang Zhihuan spoke candidly, saying that Intel's plan to build a factory to produce memory chips was equivalent to mocking."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "The reason why Zhang Zhihuan is not enthusiastic about Intel entering the diamond industry is because he still harbors a grudge against Intel for something that happened more than 30 years ago."
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Intel was a shining star in the American manufacturing industry, occupying a leading position globally and dominating the world's semi-conductor market.
"In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductors have been monopolized by a small number of strong players."
At that time, the semiconductor industry had a characteristic IDM mode, and the entire chip, from design to testing, was completed by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this mode of operation makes it difficult for some small businesses to survive, and many semiconductor startup founders are unable to afford the huge costs of building a production line, and can only dream about it.
Under the call of market demand in the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to exhibit a trend of cooperative division of labor, and in 1984, Zhang Zhihuan heard that there was a company specializing in semiconductor design, and he believed that since there was a specialized company for design, they could establish a factory dedicated to wafer production.
"Not long after, Zhang Zhiang's plan became a reality, and Tai Jiu Electric was established."
Translate this sentence into English: "Taiwan Semiconductor has targeted the 'Diamond Processing' single node, without design, only providing manufacturing services for diamond products."
At the time when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was just established, it was just a small and insignificant player in the face of Intel's overwhelming dominance.
To obtain capital support, Zhang Zhi even tried to seek investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that Tsinghua was only involved in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, they seemed to have a high opinion of themselves and refused to invest in Tsinghua.
Loosely translated, the sentence could be:  Zhang Zhiang also believed that English Electric at the time was not paying attention to the process of providing gems and jewelry services.
"没想到当年看不起晶圆制造服务的巨头，如今却也要开始做晶圆代工."
Therefore, Zhang Zhongyuan feels that Intel's entry into the diamond industry is very hurtful.
"Today, the market value of Tesla has already exceeded that of Intel."
Confronted with the strength of Taiwan's power grid, Intel is also reluctant to stand still.
"Taiwan Semiconductor has already pushed towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago."
"To surpass one's actual abilities is not an easy task."
"Not yet."
"Ordered at 19:06, took 2 hours 😅"
"I'm here to check out some strange searches."
What is normal social behavior?
Randomly select three hot search terms: February 2nd Dragon Head, Good-looking Friend's Price Increase, and Jiaolala Event, which spreads the mood and forms a wave, then the index drops (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, and if there is a second wave of mood, a small peak will reappear.
"They are as different as chalk and cheese from the 'network sentiment performance model' that was exhibited by the network administration office."
What is an abnormal mood?
The translation of the sentence "随机挑选同一事件中的六个热搜，呈现出【孤峰状】、【锯齿状】、【断崖状】" in English is:  "Randomly selecting six hot spots from the same event, displaying [peak state], [ridge state], and [cliff state]."
"孤峰状" can be translated to "peak status" or "peak popularity."  "锯齿状" can be translated to "periodic heating" or "cyclical popularity."  "断崖状" can be translated to "collective withdrawal" or "collective cooling."
In sentence "图9中，一个事件的热度波峰恰好是另一事件的波谷，时间分秒不差，必定是统一批水军接到任务，开启新一轮攻势。"  * "图9中" refers to Figure 9. * "一个事件的热度波峰恰好是另一事件的波谷" means "The peak of one event's heat wave is almost the valley of another event." * "时间分秒不差" means "time doesn't differ by a second." * "必定是统一批水军接到任务，开启新一轮攻势
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in a nutshell: dozens of hot searches at the same time, which ones attract eyeballs, which ones are responsible for popularizing science, which ones are strategic, which ones shift the focus, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones ignite emotions, which ones control decision-making, and almost consider all elements of the diffusion of social sentiment.
"Propaganda is a science, throwing out subjective opinions and emotions, and only relying on objective data, black propaganda can take on any form."
"Leaving traces behind as one walks, such traces as these, we will dig them out together."
"Data source: hot search time machine."

"At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 yuan for basic renovation."
"As soon as I came into the store, a series of scams started."
"This is the first time I came to the store, and all I did was show them my floor plan. They didn't even come to measure the house in person, but they were still able to give me a quote for my 135 square meter house for 7 million yuan, roughly. They didn't even look at the materials they were using, so I have no idea what brand of materials they were using."

Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "The stars are about to welcome the Scorpio Double Star Rain on the 14th day."
"New China News Agency in Tianjin on December 12 reported (by reporter Zhou Runjian) that astronomical experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the Double Cluster Meteor Shower, will arrive on December 14, and those who love meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the night on that day."
"Beijing city amateur astronomers in 2018 on December 13th captured the double star rainbow in the constellation of the Twins in Qinghai."
Most of the meteor showers' parent bodies are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Double Cluster meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
"双子座流星雨" is also the second known meteor shower that is not caused by the "pregnant" star.
The translation of the sentence is:  The president of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and a well-known astronomical expert, Peng Xuefeng, introduced that the "Double Ninth Festival" meteor shower is generally visible at the end of one's life, and the "viewing period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The Northern Cross Rain is known for its large volume and stability, and is commonly referred to as one of the three great star rains of the Northern Hemisphere along with the Orion Nebula Star Rain and the Celestial Entrance Star Rain.
One prominent feature of the Double Cluster meteor shower is that the meteor speed is relatively slow, the color is rich, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for both visual observation and for beginner astrophotography.
The translation of the sentence is: "Tianjin City's amateur astronomer Yang Yingjie captured the double star rainbow in the constellation of Gemini in Tianjin Binzhou on December 13, 2020."
The astronomical prediction shows that this year's Gemini meteor shower will arrive on December 14th around 15:00 and reach a great peak, with a maximum ZHR (number of meteors visible per hour) of 150 under ideal observation conditions, where the radiant point is located directly above the observer's head.
"双子座流星雨推荐指数图."
"Last year, the 'Falling Petals' double star rainbow left a deep impression on people, but this year's double star rainbow will be affected by moonlight interference and the degree of brilliance will decrease slightly."
"On November 11th, which is the 11th day of the agricultural calendar, the moon is in the bright phase, and its bright light will interfere with observation. It is best to observe in the latter half of the night when the moon is low, and at this time, the radiant point of the Double Star rain will also be relatively high."
"Friends who enjoy watching meteor showers can observe in the latter half of the night after the moon has set, but be sure to dress warmly to avoid getting cold."
How can we observe as many shooting stars as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe the phenomenon in the city. You can choose a secluded place in the suburbs or countryside, such as a high coastal area with little light pollution and facing the northeastern direction, and wait patiently after the moon has set to observe the phenomenon."
It is worth noting that the stream of stars from the Double Cluster in each direction is very large, so when observing, do not stare continuously at the Double Cluster's radiation point.
"A friend who enjoys photography wants to capture the stunning 'Meteor Rainbow' , it is best to choose a wide-angle lens and a large aperture for the camera, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting."
"Considering stability and sustainability, a three-legged stand, backup battery, and emergency power line are indispensable."
"修立鹏提醒说." 的英文翻译是 "Set up a reminder to wake up early."
What is the difference in market position between laser TV and traditional TV?
According to my understanding, the "traditional television" referred to by the topic means a cathode ray tube (CRT) television. In terms of market positioning, there are two main differences between laser televisions and cathode ray tube televisions:
"Firstly, the laser TV market is becoming more concentrated in the large-screen market."
Compared to the liquid crystal television market that is expanding, the positioning of the laser television market is more focused on the large-screen market, or you could say that the laser television itself is a product born for the large-screen market.
Currently, the mainstream sizes of liquid crystal televisions are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally over 75 inches, with some even exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large, high-definition screens.
In recent years, the output and sales of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than six percent of total TV sales above 80 inches.
According to the forecast by China Electronics, the market for laser televisions in 2020 is expected to grow by over 140%, and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why the results in the large-screen market are so good is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser televisions in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television reflection, the laser light source does not directly shine into the eyeball, compared to the backlight of a liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of object imaging, and the stimulus to the eye is also smaller.
The translation of the sentence is: "The West Experimental Room of the Institute of Standardization of Electronic Technology in China and the ophthalmology experts at Beijing Calare Medical Center observed the same population under strict conditions while watching laser TV and LCD TV, obtaining 144 sets of test data."
"Data evidence: Laser TV does indeed have very strong eye-protection characteristics, and in certain aspects even has a certain improvement effect."
As visual health becomes an increasingly important consideration in today's society, laser TV is not only attracting more users by virtue of its eye-protecting advantages, but is also opening up a new frontier in the electronic market.
Secondly, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
"Opposite to the price of liquid crystal televisions, the price of laser televisions is constantly being lowered. Currently, the price of laser televisions is mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually rising."
What is so expensive about a laser TV?
"确认是有道理的。"
"Under the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD and projection TVs."
"By using ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection devices. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, and the required space is not large. Moreover, it is small and compact, and occupies little space."
"In terms of brightness, major brand LED TVs can achieve a luminance of over 2000."
"Adding insulation reduces the amount of heat generated, resulting in lower equipment wear and a longer lifespan for televisions."
In addition to this, many high-end laser TV models also load many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition video quality, artificial intelligence systems, and synthetic screens, which can bring users a more stunning visual and auditory experience.
Don't talk about false needs, but rather the products of needs, the discussion of product quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audiovisual players, if you want to consider both big screen and viewing environment, you can try it, everything has its pros and cons, and you should balance them yourself after listening to one side of the story.
In simple terms, the ultra-wide-angle projection machine - laser TV, in order to place close to the screen, must use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors, which does not conform to the optimal optical design.
To mask some of the environmental light and use a fine-structured fiber screen, which is expensive, the price of an 80-inch screen is basically the same as swapping out a 65-inch liquid crystal display.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "There's one more thing I particularly dislike, that is, the projector manufacturers selling 'throw' as their selling point. They use it to lure people in, but the light on the screen that can be seen by the eyes is actually direct light. If you throw it onto the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. It's not that I prefer a more real liquid crystal television, but isn't it also 'direct' when you open the TV ceiling light?"
"Furthermore, the projection screen fabric cannot be made if there is no reflection. It simply cannot be done."
The phrase "恰恰被忽略了高增益幕布的热斑（光斑）效应，某一角度大量光线反射到眼睛，那才是真难受。" can be translated to: "The hot spots (light spots) on the high gain screen are difficult to ignore, especially when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle."
"The Visual Aesthetics Photography Library selects high-quality products from the store temporarily without branch stores."
"After scheduling a WeChat appointment date, my little sister sent me the available time options and replied to my message quite promptly."
"Previously, I looked at the photography works displayed in the store, most of which were outdoor wedding photos. They were all very beautiful, and the photography style involved was also very diverse."
"After that day, I had a simple conversation with my little sister about my thoughts, and she patiently helped me try on two different styles of clothing that I was struggling with. In the end, we finally decided on a concept and started preparing for the photo shoot. The photographer will usually set up some equipment and guide the poses, paying close attention to every detail."
However, it's possible that because we didn't discuss specific shooting ideas, the final product may not be the style I had in mind, but it should still be visually pleasing 🙊🙊.
After taking the photos, the photographer will help choose pictures, discuss post-shoot style, and feel very meticulous.
"A well-made film takes about half a month, and the effect is quite good."
Here's the English translation of the sentence: "The second time around, the photogenic king's dining event was held ~ Most of the on-site clothing can be selected for photography."
"Finally chose a black dress, experienced different styles."
The entire filming process took about two hours, including makeup and photography. The photographer in charge of filming was the 95 generation's little brother, and he felt a bit fresh, hoping to be able to give more suggestions in the future for customer filming actions. The filming process was quite pleasant.
Visual aesthetics photography library preferred quality store response.
"Scrolled to the top, let's take a look at Queenie~"
"After filling out my name and phone number, I chose the clothing and wedding dresses, and patiently tried on several sets of clothes. I was satisfied with my choice and spent a long time having my makeup and hair done. The service staff were very attentive and taught me how to pose for photos, which made me feel like my face was too big. The hairstylist said it would take half a month to perfect it, but only a few days later, it felt like there was no difference from the original."
The overall environment is good.
The English translation of "可选衣服很多" is "There are many optional clothes."
The translation of the sentence "化妆位置差不多有三个，里边是摄影棚" in English is:  "There are only three makeup positions, and a photography studio is located inside."
"Service": very attentive and meticulous.
"Designer has a lot of patience."
"The photographer will also be very meticulous in teaching you the actions."
"Not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to retouch."
Translation: [Experience] It's possible that the styling is a bit outdated, as the original double eyelids were replaced with three eyelids.
"The mustache was also shaved off. It's a bit embarrassing for daily life without a mustache."
"Photos taken ten days ago were provided, but the P-graph effect is not satisfactory, and I feel that the double eyelids are still quite obvious."
"Because I'm not sure what style to choose, I tried two sets. The result was hit or miss. I even chose a black wedding dress. My little sister said this set is quite retro-chic."
"选好衣服后就开始弄妆发啦 发型师和化妆师小姐姐都超级耐心在帮我弄 弄出来的效果非常满意"
"After putting on makeup, the photographer started taking pictures. The entire process was under the control of the photographer, and it was very smooth and harmonious."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "After taking the photos, he carefully chose the four photos he liked the most, and the little brother said the final product was a 15-minute video with a satisfying ending."
"It has been 3 days since I last replied... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly plan!"
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card to make payments.
"I have to pay for shipping every time now."
Would it be okay to waive the fee for now and collect it later after you have finished your investigation?
"小雨伞买保险，靠谱吗？" can be translated to "Does the little umbrella buy insurance? Is it reliable?" in English.
"小雨伞" is an insurance intermediary platform on the internet.
According to the instructions in the "Regulations on the Administration of Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Revised Version)," to become a insurance intermediary, one must meet three key conditions: the shareholder must not have a recent record of serious violations, the minimum registered capital must be RMB 5000 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "These three points are actually very strict, and when you sum them up, it means that you need to have strength, and you need to go through the approval of the national regulatory department of the insurance company and the bank, and the shareholders must have a good reputation, as a small insurance agency of XYZ Insurance, the insured party does not need to doubt whether the small insurance agency is legal or not, after all, there are these three conditions, and it is not something that any insurance company can achieve."
"On this point, he is not bad, he is trustworthy."
From the perspective of insurance products, Little Umbrella Insurance is like an insurance supermarket. Many of the stars of other companies' insurance products can be found on this platform, such as the latest addition, the Thai Super Star 5 Catastrophic Insurance, where both the insurer and the reinsurer are Thai people. Little Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary and should not be suspected of its reliability.
From a fee-paying perspective: The products on internet platforms are generally more affordable due to the absence of operating costs and personnel expenses, and the flexible fee-paying method supports monthly payments, reducing the burden of premium payment on the insured, and at the same time, it maximizes the leveraging of insurance guarantees.
"This is still very good."
"Consider it."
From a professional perspective, this is particularly important because the insurance industry has very high professional requirements, and many internet product customers can self-insure, which can result in many errors in health notification and occupational categories. Insurance professionals often have their own subjective opinions when selling insurance, believing themselves to be healthy or suitable, which can easily result in many hidden risks and may be rejected for insurance.
"I have previously worked at 'Tencent Weipao' (similar to Little Red Riding Hood and also an internet insurance platform) doing insurance phone sales, informing everyone of my responsible attitude."
The translation of the sentence is: "The insurance for the Internet is real, but also relies on trust, without trust it is the people, the channels of the Internet do not have professional staff, and there are many sales misleads."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "For example, you can get 600 million yuan of insurance for 1 yuan, buy insurance and get a free mobile phone, and enjoy 6 million personal accident insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are too light. They do not tell the insurance purchaser that the first month's premium is only 1 yuan, and the subsequent month's premium may be several tens to 200 yuan, and many customers do not know what they are paying for when they buy insurance for one or two years."
"Thinking you can spend 1 yuan, the insurance company will compensate 600 million (a drop in the ocean)."
"Free mobile phone delivery is only available for special insurance numbers such as 6666 or 8888. If there is a lucky draw SMS, there will be no replacement or reminder from others."
For the insured person, it is also a pitfall to have free coverage of up to CNY 6 million for serious illnesses. This is only temporary, and if they only rely on this, they will have no other commercial insurance to fall back on if a serious illness occurs. Even if they have CNY 6 million in coverage, it may not be enough to solve their problems and ensure a comfortable life in the future.
"Currently, the state is strictly cracking down on misleading sales of online insurance."
Taken all together, the platform is no problem, the product is no problem, the problem is the professional level and job performance of the business staff.
"It is recommended that the topic be carefully considered. In fact, many offline insurance companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products may also have better value for money than online products."
"I have helped myself to assist 59 internet customers, and I guarantee offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan per year."
"If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me."
Me: Mingyuan Insurance Broker, with over 3 years of experience in business management training, have served over 1000 enterprise customers, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance purchase, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for the customer's individual needs. During the insurance purchase process, I will negotiate with insurance companies on behalf of the customer to get the best possible insurance coverage. After the insurance purchase, I will handle the insurance policy paperwork and manage the insurance policy for the customer, giving them peace of mind.
"Grow together with every customer for a lifetime."
"I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic!"
According to the definition provided by the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is a type of insurance business in which policyholders can complete all the insurance processes on their own after clicking the insurance link.
"In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, the insurance agent does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed independently by the insured person."
Although there may not be much "ceremonial feeling" to insurance on the internet, and the printed paper contract may not even exist, this in no way affects the effectiveness and legal force of the electronic contract.
"This pattern resembles a typical telemarketing job, but buying insurance in this way also has a fatal flaw - the subsequent service may not meet expectations."
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several decades, when we buy insurance, shouldn't we seriously consider the "intermediary" we choose, is it a "mediator" that can accompany us for a long time and provide service even after many years?
"How can I contact the delivery staff?"
"It's already 3 o'clock."
"Isn't that compensation for me?"
"I said to knock on the door to deliver the goods."
But the rider was left at the door and then everyone left.
The English translation of "还送错" is "still wrong."
The translation of the sentence "你们的骑手已经在 #NUMBER# 取了我一份外卖，但到现在仍然告知等待中" in English is:  "Your messenger has already taken my order at #NUMBER#, but I am still waiting for the notification."
"The bicycle delivery person has received my order at 19:25, but still refuses to depart."
"I'm finished shopping, do you need anything else?"
Translate this sentence: "How to do?"
"Where did your bicycle go?"
"Is that all?"
"I am the one who is sending a package."
"Okay, you don't cancel, I'll call the police."
"But my food will have safety and hygiene issues."

I... also calculated it."
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "Later, I received more messages from my friends about you, including a photo of you that was uploaded to your friend's profile and comments with specific flattery."

"After I uploaded the news that I reported to the police, you didn't calm down at all, but instead became even more agitated."

I even doubt if there is any girl who would be willing to shame herself in front of others to change her name.

"Water above green comprehensive service area full coverage is another milestone event in the construction of the green navigation on the Yangtze River, and the shipborne pollutant acceptance and transportation capabilities have been significantly improved."
According to the introduction, the marine green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and life services to ships and crews, helping to solve the "urgent distress" problems of ships and crews.
"This time, the construction of the two green integrated service areas along the upstream and downstream of the Yangtze River has been put into operation, integrating life service, production service, and government service into one, with the theme of green environmental protection and the features of ship maintenance and emergency rescue services. This realizes the "one-time berth, multiple services" for ships in the port, making the work of ship personnel in the Yangtze River more efficient and their lives more convenient."

According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" of China Intel, on January 9th, a satellite in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait detected the US Navy aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" (CVN-70).
"The Bali Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific."

According to a report by CNN on January 17th, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy's arsenal was recently seen visiting the Spratly Islands.
The USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident missiles and more than 10 nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base on January 15th.
Provide the English translation for the following sentence: "美三航母集结中国周边 最强大武器罕见访问关岛 分析称，这是向印度-太平洋地区日益紧张的局势中的盟友和敌人发出了一个信号。"  The English translation is: "Three US aircraft carriers gathered near China, displaying the most powerful weapons rarely seen on the disputed islands. Analysts say this is a signal sent by allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region."
"This is the first visit by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and also the second public visit since the 1980s."
The English translation of the sentence is: "Three US aircraft carriers gather in the South China Sea, the strongest weapon rarely visits the disputed islands. China has recently been building a large number of military facilities on the Nansha Islands."
The translation of the sentence "图为中国在南沙群岛的永暑岛" in English is:  "The map shows China's Yongxing Island in the Nansha Islands."
(南海研究论坛) The US Navy announced that the Russian nuclear-powered submarine "Yuriy Dolgorukiy" has strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region by visiting the disputed islands, showcasing the US's capabilities, flexibility, military readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the region.
The translation of the sentence "弹道导弹潜艇通常被称为“雷鸣潜艇”（Boomer submarine）" in English is:  "A ballistic missile submarine is usually referred to as a 'Boomer submarine.'"
The tracking of the 14-ship "Storm Petrel" submarine fleet of the US Navy is usually strictly confidential.
"Around the secret of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, "Storm Turtle" became "the most important survival weapon" in the "nuclear triad" system, which also includes land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in the United States, as well as B-2 and B-52 strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads."
"Recently, Meta has fallen by 26%, with a market capitalization of 2510 billion US dollars. Shkreli responded, 'facing unprecedented competition', why?"
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially a advertising company, with the majority of its revenue coming from advertising. It is currently one of the most profitable advertising companies, and it has its own traffic channels.
"Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels."
Not only is this so, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," many apps outside of Meta use Meta's advertising platform to achieve realization.
However, the times have changed.
"First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it has become difficult for Meta to access user data information, which has affected the efficiency of advertising placement."
"Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly and will clearly prompt users to allow or deny the App access to their information. Most people's normal response is to deny permission."
"Next, if Google takes another knife, its impact on Meta's income will be even greater."
Secondly, the factors affecting Meta's revenue growth in the past, including those in China, have weakened (the exact proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does indeed exist).
"Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate."
"Each year, at least 10% of Meta's income comes from China, mainly from companies in China that contribute to the marine business."
"Meta has several hundred employees in its office in Hong Kong, and several large agents on the mainland."
The English translation of the sentence is: "Chinese companies want to expand their international market, and Meta is an indispensable advertising channel. Most of the money spent on advertising goes to Meta."
"有意思的是，现在字节的 TT 是 Meta 主要的竞争对手之一，但是前两年 Meta 从字节身上可赚到不少钱。"
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "All the domestic agencies are helping characters go to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is not bad."
"I haven't specifically looked into it, but I am sure it won't be better than before."
"Chinese companies have already passed the stage of burning money on a large scale abroad."
"Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth."
"Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are no longer under Meta's control."
The biggest problem is not just income decline, but a lack of growth expectations.
"The stock market not only looks at current income, but more importantly looks at future expectations."
"It is quite clear that the expectations for Meta are not sufficient."
"To tell a new story to the market, Howard Schultz spoke of 'the metaverse'."
"It is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the realization period of metaverse is relatively long. This story may not be able to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years."
Therefore, the next two years should be difficult for Meta.
"Facebook's financial situation is currently very bright, with annual revenues of 1 trillion to 2 trillion US dollars. In fact, Facebook is currently facing a very strong sense of crisis, and compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good security moat."
Although his several social software products are quite popular in his daily life and are mainstream social software such as Facebook and WhatsApp, he still has no confidence to compete with TikTok's rapid development, and the gap between them is just a matter of time.
Here's the English translation of the sentence:  "And the concept of the metaverse, which is a desirable but unattainable idea, has no hope of success in a short time, making it a very risky proposition, which is also the root cause of why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and is constantly seeking new channels. However, I believe his channel selection is wrong, and it is a dead end."  Note: The original sentence is in Chinese, and I have translated it into English as accurately as possible.
