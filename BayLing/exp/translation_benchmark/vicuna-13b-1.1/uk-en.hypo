Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect.
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO, while only 18% of those surveyed supported it.
After the Revolution of Dignity, Viktor Yanukovych's flight, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of opponents of NATO began to decline, while the number of supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
"After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded the highest level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%."
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in the context of the war, there is a lot of criticism directed at NATO and Ukrainian members - for the delayed delivery of weapons, refusal to close the airspace, and reluctance to provoke Russia.
"In addition to this, there is a significant risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to Russia's position, if this can stop the war and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones."
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth," we talk about how exactly Alliance has been helping Ukraine since the moment of the Russian invasion, what exactly NATO should criticize Alliance for, and what is futile, why our prospect of membership in NATO is closer than ever in history, and why security guarantees that are being discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.

However, Zelensky speaks less with them and more with their voters and the general public.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of tens of thousands in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was previously unavailable to any of his predecessors.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged of Russian forces committing atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a "provocation."
"The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, stated to journalists in Wellington on April 4 that messages about Russian soldiers killing, raping, and severely injuring peaceful Ukrainian civilians are worthy of condemnation."
"Russia should answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, called the incidents "a violation of international law."
The statement was made after reports emerged that hundreds of peaceful residents were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in a suburb of Kyiv, Bucha, by Russian troops who had been stationed in the area for several weeks after the occupation.
The photographs, which allegedly depicted the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear actions," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro S√°nchez, stated that Russian troops could advance so far that they would commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We are doing everything so that those who committed these war crimes will not remain unpunished," said Sanchez in Madrid.
"Appearing on state television late on April 3rd, the spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, rejected the accusations as 'provocation'."
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the depiction to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made within the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any suspicions about who "ordered" this story, - said Zakhrova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the picture of Butch is "another provocation by the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
The Investigative Committee of Russia announced on April 4 that it was launching an investigation into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about Russian troops' actions in Bucha.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told the leaders of the Kremlin to come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," said Zelensky in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
The English translation for "–Ü —î —Å–ø—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∞ –≤—ñ–¥–ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥–∞–ª—å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å" is "There is joint responsibility."
"For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, and Russian military personnel should be held accountable for the actions of Russian troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of the victims scattered in the streets of Bucha, a city approximately 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty saw on April 2 the bodies of what appeared to be civilians in the streets of a small town.
"Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street."
Journalists from AP saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of a group of nine people - all civilians - were scattered on the ground near a location that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears that the victims were killed at close range.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 peaceful civilians were found in the district of Kyiv that was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is okay, we have bought everything on the list.
"They were told: Kyiv does not exist." How occupiers drove Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, and torture.
In this list, there is another point about which there is significantly less information currently available - the evacuation of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Approximately from mid-March, Russian occupiers "evacuate" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements on their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed president Lukashenko effectively handed over to the Russian military polygon.
Ukrainian Truth found displaced Ukrainians and their relatives to inquire about the evacuation itself and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary-compulsory evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and from a dead end.
"On luck, they are alive and maintain contact with their relatives."
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, a large number of citizens were forcibly taken to Russia and Belarus.
"In Melitopol, Russians kidnapped the personnel of the second maternity hospital, took away the children without parents, including a 12-year-old Miroslava, daughter of the late Ukrainian champion in swimming Yosyp Zachepinsky."

As true plastuny, Denis and Marina gathered their alarm bags in advance, but they did not manage to evacuate in the morning of the 24th of February.
"They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses were already not taking anyone."
Approximately at 12 o'clock in the day on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter "V", followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long time, until March 17th, when the Russian soldiers took them to Belarus.
Approximately 40 people were hiding in their basement.
"Not everyone decided to go."
"At 6 o'clock on the evening of February 24th, people came to the entrance who spoke and did not speak Russian or Ukrainian."
"Asking: 'Is there someone?' - I say 'yes.' - 'Go out!'"
They tricked me, asked who was in the basement and if there was any weapon.
"All the men were questioned as to whether they had served in the army."
Women were told: "We have come to protect you at the instruction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
This was a Chechen OMON, even not the army, young boys aged 25-35.
They said: " Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sasha White (he commanded a unit of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking" that fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we lacked.
We say that there was a big problem with the water.
They broke into the store, took goods with them under the pretext of "it doesn't matter, the Russians will take it anyway," and brought us six barrels.
There is still a video on the internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
"This is how they came after looting the store and brought sausage, saying: 'We understand that it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmadovich.'"
No one in particular wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful incision.
"Our child says: 'You have 7 days to give us back our phones' - they laughed."
"They constantly separated themselves from the Russians."
"They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want the war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a bastard, but Kadyrov is also, but we can do nothing, because there are our families."
"They mainly did not fight, but went around looting stores, pillaging."
"They tied a crow to one leg and a white scarf to the other, and called it 'the recruit'."
"They came to Ukraine completely unprepared."
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, they didn't even pick up the dead, and they asked us, "Do you have any artillery?"
"Moreover, we had organized units - Chechens did not know each other among themselves in the first few days, they asked for passwords to determine whether they were friend or foe."
"They were with us until March 13th, after which a Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk detachment."
"They set up 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - we constantly fell into it from 'Bayraktars'."
"But they came and told us that the ZSU no longer exists, but there is 'AZOV', and according to their words, 'AZOV' has 100,000 in Ukraine."
"The narrative 'Kyiv has already surrendered' has been promoted since the beginning of March."
"Once upon a time, a Russian man came to us - either a naval officer, or an FSB representative - and said that there would be an evacuation."
"And we were listening to the radio - there was news about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought, maybe they'll give us a 'green corridor' too."
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
They tell us: "You will be taken to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov."
We are saying that we don't want to go anywhere.
What is the translation for this sentence in English?
"How did it work? They lured us into the basement and started shooting at us from under the house - either with "Grad" rockets or with mortars."
And then it flew back... The neighboring houses simply burned down, and part of them collapsed.
"There was a direct hit on our house on the third floor."
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to turn us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of it did not go, saying that it was for traitors of the motherland - allegedly, "they shoot you there and sell your organs."

A British soldier who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian army says he is ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British soldier serving in the Ukrainian Marine Brigade, who is participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
The source: twitter page of Eidin Aislin, a British man who served in the ranks of the Ukrainian army from 2018, VVS with a reference to family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News with a reference to the words of his friend who spoke with him.
According to a tweet by Aslin: "We received a message from him: 'We have been trying everything for 48 days to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.'"
"We did not lack food or ammunition."
"Thank you to all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate marine brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is participating in the defensive operation in Mariupol.
Journalists from VVs contacted the mother of military serviceman En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had called her on the phone to say that they were planning to surrender.
The English translation for the sentence is: "Military friend Brennan Phillips also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone conversation, Islin mentioned their unit's plans to surrender."
According to his words, the brigade has run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from the Atlas News publication have contacted his friend who said that the Aislin unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order to avoid being unarmed and without ammunition in the hands of so-called "Kadyrovtsy" units.
"Also, audio recordings of the phone conversation were spread in social networks, where it seems that Aslin speaks with his American friend who plans to come to Ukraine."
In the conversation, Essex said that they had attempted to leave the city in civilian clothes, but they were unable to do so.
Earlier, the Briton said that he had been threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner" on Instagram.

Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law 7176, which is called "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere."
Strangely, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere has turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that decisions made by the supervisory board of the state company in virtual Kyiv could somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new dangers to state companies, but so far we do not know about any company where it is necessary to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of its location.
The potential threat from such a law is understood - it is a great basis for "dismantling" all assets in a heavy reform of state enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
"Take, such as it was before 2015."
What is the purpose of supervisory boards for state-owned companies and who should be included in them?
"Moreover, if one harmful bill is passed under the patriotic slogans "rise," then others can also "rise" tomorrow - for example, the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU."
"Many things can be attributed to war."
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
"On February 22, this norm was added to the comparative table of the draft law 5397."
"And in general, the desire to accelerate the work of the supervisory board in one way or another is circulating among some elected people for a long time already."
"Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, let's examine the arguments used to justify its adoption."
And then we will provide our proposals on how to manage state enterprises during a war.
The First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the necessity of this innovation by highlighting the risks of losing the internet and other communication tools, which would make remote work for supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to make necessary decisions, which may result in the paralysis of the company's work.
We agree that such a risk exists, however, can he prevent the relocation of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation where independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the total composition) prioritize their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they may be released.
"And further, most likely, this will lead to the loss of quorum required for the supervisory board to take any decisions."
Instead, appointing new independent members to the supervisory board will not be quick, as the law provides for the necessity of conducting a competitive selection process, which on average takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposal made by draft law 7176 is unlikely to preserve the possibility of taking decisions for the supervisory board, on the contrary, it will lead to this!
The people's deputy and author of the legislative proposal, Dmitry Natalukha, provides other arguments in favor of his support.
In particular, he notes: "Many enterprises, especially those in the defense-industrial complex (OPK), now require relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person, for example, from Vienna can discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom."
"For starters, there are almost no state-owned enterprises in the OPK sector in Ukraine that have supervisory boards."
The supervisory board is only in "Ukroboronprom", which in essence manages almost all state enterprises of the OPK.
Even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a voluntary basis.
The full power of governance in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who incidentally will also make a decision on the necessity of relocating either this or that OPK enterprise that is part of the conglomerate.
"Besides, this argument does not withstand criticism even because the draft law 7176 in general does not introduce any changes to the legislation that regulates the activity of state-owned enterprises in the OPK sector."
"Pan Dmytro also cites emotional arguments on his Facebook page."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing in common with increasing the efficiency of state companies and banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "Respectable foreign experts, upon hearing the word 'war,' leave Ukraine at the very beginning of 2021, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards of Ukrainian state enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine is actually suffering from the war."
Firstly, this is manipulation - most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally come here.
To say that they "leave Ukraine," mildly speaking, is unfair.
"Secondly, as a result of the pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings."
This instrument has long been widespread in world practice, including in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also worth remembering that membership on the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have another occupation, and electronic communication tools actually help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as exclusively directed towards foreigners.
It is interesting why Mr. Dmitry does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians.
"For they too are not located in the place where their companies are located."
Before the word, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war - this is only a new convenient opportunity.

"On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will be in effect from 9:00 pm on April 2 to 6:00 am on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the oblast VA, it is strictly prohibited to be in the streets of populated areas and other public places at the moment. It is also prohibited to move around by transport and on foot.
"Residents can only go outside during the alarm signal to seek shelter."
Such restrictions are introduced in order to eliminate the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean up and demine the territories.

"Can we do this today by phone?"
"To buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, and threads for embroidery."
"I understand, so I can prepare material in this field."
I will ask her. It is a bit embarrassing for me to ask, but she gives us so many piroshki.
"We will meet with my father for sure üôèüèª"
"I read an announcement on Facebook, so maybe Google wrote something about it. I think the phone number is enough."
Good day, we took the things you brought, but there are some small things that you can bring to us in 10 minutes?
The English translation for "–Ø –ø–æ–¥—É–º–∞–ª–∞ –∑ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥—É —Ä–æ–±–æ—Ç–∏" is "I thought about work."
"If the director invites me, I can start coming to work next week because I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if possible, because the lines are very long) and in Saturday it's going to rain."
"I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry in school, I am learning Czech to be able to know it perfectly, my dream is to work at Teva."
"Old friends are few, and not very close, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, but friends in spirit and intellect."
The English translation for the sentence "–¢–µ–ø–µ—Ä –¥–æ –≤–∞—Å —Ç–µ–∂ –ø—Ä–∏–π—à–ª–∏ —Ç—è–∂–∫—ñ —á–∞—Å–∏" is "Now difficult times have also come to you."
"During the last month, I have been in communication with many of you."
Your life, which was never easy to begin with, has turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
"Many of you are fleeing from Russia."
"Many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame over the actions of your country towards your neighbors."
"Through those for whom you are responsible in Ukraine."
Over some of you activists, the threat has long been hanging, and you were getting ready for the decisive blow.
"At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkassov, my very old friend from the 'Memorial'."
"Let's talk later, as usual, replied Sasha laconically. Now after the search, we'll walk around the ruins."
"Others, however, are cultural figures, artists, critics, and writers who have been struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world."
"No one among you likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, the majority of you hate them."
Let's be honest: except for a very small number of you who worked at "Memorial", "Novaya Gazeta", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organization, and in several other places, how many of you have done at least something to oppose this regime?
"Besides perhaps participating in rallies when they still took place."
"Read also the column of the Russian journalist 'Late to hide, late to be silent.'"
"And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt - is not just an abstraction?"
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive participation, which now, probably, have become a heavy burden on your soul and heart.
"It was not always like that."
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you to a certain extent possessed freedom and democracy - chaotic and even bloody, but genuine.
"But 1991 was not better than 1917."
"Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are eventually overcome by such a strong fear of chaos that you seek salvation behind the back of the ruler, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?"
However many people he may have killed, you still think it's safer to be near him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Gestapo, you left your soul at the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform itself, and take control of the country.
When you were faced with the choice between looting the country and returning communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted looting.
In 1998, your economy fell, which marked the end of mass protests for social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The English translation for the sentence "–ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ—é —Ç—É—Ä–±–æ—Ç–æ—é —Å—Ç–∞–ª–æ –≤–∏–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è" is "Survival became the main concern."
Then appeared Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
"A small number of you bought it, but you still either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all."
When he started leveling Chechnya with the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to this.
The English translation for "–Ø –¥–æ–±—Ä–µ –ø–∞–º'—è—Ç–∞—é —Ç—ñ —Ä–æ–∫–∏" is "I remember those years well."
"I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and I saw the ruins of Grozny, Katyr-Yurt, Itum-Kali, and other cities with my own eyes."
Sometimes on weekends, I would return to Moscow and have a great time partying with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed, the atrocities committed against innocent civilians, the murdered children, and the soldiers who sold the bodies of their fallen comrades to their families.
You told me: "Bredel, we are tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was outraged: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya."
"This is your country, devil take it, not mine."
The English translation for "–Ø —Ç—É—Ç –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –¥—É—Ä–Ω–∏–π —ñ–Ω–æ–∑–µ–º–µ—Ü—å" is "I am just a stupid foreigner."
"This is your power to bomb one of your cities, to kill your own citizens."
"But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything."
Then came the economic upswing of the mid-2000s, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look the other way as some of the stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
"Many of you have become well-off, some have become rich, and even the poorest among you have bought a new home and found a better job."
The prices rose, but what of it?
Moscow shone and sparkled with lights.
When a few oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochyhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
"However, the matter did not proceed further."
When Putin transferred the presidency to Medvedev and took the position of prime minister, as far as I can see, you barely paid attention to this.
"When after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent."
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
"I have to admit that we in the West did not do much, if anything at all."
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia loudly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and internal market was there?
Living in Russia was good.
"And after the hard 1990s, this was the most important."
However, at the end of 2011, my Russian friends, you still woke up.
"When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and sat in the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was already too much, and you massively went out on protests."
The name Navalny became derogatory, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing its footing.
"After that, he struck back in response."
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
"Thousands found themselves behind bars."
Some people received huge terms.
"What could we do?"
The English translation for this sentence is: "I feel it so often and still hear it."
The translation for the sentence "–î–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∞ —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–∞, –∞ –º–∏ —Ç–∞–∫—ñ —Å–ª–∞–±–∫—ñ" in English is "The state is so strong, while we are so weak."
What is it, look at the Ukrainians.
"Look at what they did two years ago."
Outraged by the pro-Russian president who had deceived their European expectations, they captured Maidan once - and have never left it since.
"They fully independently set up a tent town and prepared for a decisive defense."
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves using sticks, armor, and Molotov cocktails.
Ultimately, the police opened fire.
Instead of running away, protesters launched an attack.
"Many have died, but they won."
"Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians returned to themselves democracy, the right to independently elect their leaders and oust them if they do not do their job well."
"Maydan very did not please Putin."
This was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
"Some of you were against it, but the benefits from it were minimal."
And how many of you were in ecstasy!
To the best of my knowledge, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.
"From where suddenly appeared a new myth, and many of you who despised Putin and his clique suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to worship him."
"I find it hard to find a reason because we immediately stopped communicating after that."
The rest of those who remained my friends mainly kept silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
"And you were hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks, just like new after restoration, which the mayor of Moscow started in 2012, with their playgrounds, public Wi-Fi, and hipster cafes."
"In truth, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful - and it's only getting better."
You barely paid attention to Syria.
"Were there terrorists there, wasn't it?"
"What is this IDIL? Even a Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it then in an interview, because I apparently knew nothing about what was happening in Syria."
"Well, at least I went there and saw with my own eyes how the government snipers on the streets of Homs cold-bloodedly shot at my children's peers."
"Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who started bombing thousands of peaceful civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war."
"Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:"
First they came for the socialists, but I remained silent, for I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I remained silent because I was not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent, for I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could speak up for me.
How many of you spoke about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
"Some of you are doing this."
The majority remained silent.
"Some people are really talking right now - for example, Dmitry Gluhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov, and others."
The majority allows themselves to speak from beyond the border, while some, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risk ending up in a new GULAG or forming a company for Navalny.
"As for the others, you know best where you live."
Therefore, I am confident that you understand: when Putin sorts out the Ukrainians - or, what seems very likely, if it doesn't work out for him, - he will take you on.
"For all of you, my friends: for those who are brave, but mostly acted alone in going out to protests and has not yet resulted in a significant term, but will soon receive a more serious one."
"Out of a thousand of you, who signed petitions, who expressed dissatisfaction in social networks (even just a black square on Instagram) or expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work."
"The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote are long gone - and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future."
Who will speak in your favor? Who will remain?
"The example of Ukrainians - even more so than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight against it."
What is the English translation for: "–Ü —â–æ —Ä–æ–∑—É–º, –º–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∞—Ü—ñ—è —ñ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ–±—Ä—ñ—Å—Ç—å –º–æ–∂—É—Ç—å –π–æ–≥–æ –∑—É–ø–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–∏, —è–∫–æ—é –± –≥–Ω—ñ—Ç—é—á–æ—é –Ω–µ –±—É–ª–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø–∞–ø–µ—Ä—ñ –π–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–∞–≥–∞."?  The English translation for the given sentence is: "And what intellect, motivation, and courage can stop him, however daunting his advantage may be on paper."
Taking into account everything, few in Russia understand this, as well as the fact that the war is ongoing in general.
"But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now."
"You read foreign news on the internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain contact."
"Putin knows that you know."
The English translation for "–¢–æ–º—É –±—É–¥—å—Ç–µ –Ω–∞–ø–æ–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤—ñ" is "Therefore, be prepared."
You understand to what it all leads.
"A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end."
Your elections are just a joke, your laws, unless you take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media no longer exist, your economy is collapsing faster than I am writing this, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket to fly abroad, even if some flights still remain.
"Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement, your obedience."
"I, if you do not give him what he wants, you can try or somehow leave, or you will be disappointed."
"I doubt that you see any other option."
"And yet there still remains one."
"Which will ultimately collapse this regime."
"Perhaps, in the circumstances that have arisen, you will need less than you think."
Consider this.
The spark will ignite not from you: due to the impending economic collapse in Russia, it is most likely to flare up in the provinces, in small towns.
"When prices rise and wages are not paid, those who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will come out onto the streets."
"Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends."
"But if each city comes out on its own for rallies, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them individually."
"Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd needs to be transformed into a mass."
"You have this wonderful magical instrument - the internet, which the regime can restrict but which still works and which can be set up almost under any circumstances."
"The organization of Navel was disbanded, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones."
The English translation for the sentence "–í–∞—Å –¥—É–∂–µ –±–∞–≥–∞—Ç–æ, –≤–∞—Å –º—ñ–ª—å–π–æ–Ω–∏" is "You are very expensive, you are millions."
The Moscow police can handle up to 30,000 people in the streets of the city, possibly with tens of thousands.
"If it exceeds 300 thousand, she will be shocked."
"It will be necessary to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?"
"After all, to what did he force them to do in Ukraine, after all, through what did he force them to go?"
Of course, the danger will be very great.
"Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will be afraid for them."
"It's natural, it's normal."
The English translation for "–Ø –± –Ω–∞ –≤–∞—à–æ–º—É –º—ñ—Å—Ü—ñ —Ç–µ–∂ –±–æ—è–≤—Å—è" is "I would be afraid in your place."
"On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wants to show you that this happens to those who dare to disregard their master, who not only demand freedom, but actually try to obtain it."
"But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain."
Your son will make a joke in a chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation in the internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a Syrian cell under police batons.
"This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only continue to grow, acquiring ever larger scales."
Therefore, you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
"Act cool-headed, think strategically, and make it a reality."
"We were in class on Friday and were told that we could come in on Monday."
The English translation for the sentence "–ü—ñ–¥ –≤–µ—á—ñ—Ä –±—É–¥–µ–º–æ –¥–æ–º–∞" is "We will be at home in the evening."
What do you perceive me as a press secretary?
"Viko, how often do you go to an expensive restaurant for dinner?"
"Once upon a time, I went to a fancy restaurant for dinner."
"I will try to explain everything to her."
"We really liked it very much and we wanted something even better, so this is the best option."
"She was in a room where there were many people. She energetically tired out."
"I don't feel well, coughing, fever, loss of voice, weakness, and my head is spinning."
The English translation for "–Ø –º—É—à—É –π—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ç–æ–π —É—Ä—è–¥ –ø—Ä–∞—Ü—ñ" is "I must go to work."
"We have already done this, but they said that whoever registered in April will only receive the money at the end of the month."
"On Thursday, we need a referral, and we're taking the children to the doctor."

"It's very regrettable to lose time, but it's a life experience."
In my personal life, I am communicative, but I am also a one-woman man and I take marriage seriously.
"There was a man for whom I was supposed to get married, but he died of heart problems."
I believe that in order to create a family, people must love, respect, and trust one another.
"At present, I have not met such a person."
Good day. Where in Yeglav can you buy forms for baking paska (paper or silicone)?
"Well, thank you for the advice, I will now submit my proof of funds in the questionnaire."

"Pane Reykhardo, I apologize for disturbing you during your off-time."
"But I have important questions for you."
"I went to Natalia's game room today to visit her and say hello."
"She had an unpleasant situation."
"But when the children were on their way home, one mother refused to take her child, saying that she had come to look at things and tidy them up in that room with clothes and Valery the day before had opened our children's room until 7 pm."
Is it really possible like that?
The translation for the sentence "–†–æ–±–æ—á–∏–π —á–∞—Å –∫—ñ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–∏ –∂ –¥–æ 16:00." is "The working time of the room is also until 4:00 PM."
"And after all, it is our responsibility."
"But it doesn't open the page, my internet is very weak."
"Good day, everything is good. Kolya is working, we filled out invitations yesterday, and I was preparing for the exam with the older students in gymnasium."
The most difficult thing to understand in geometry is [the concept of] responsibility.
