The English translation for the sentence "「建物状況調査制度」の落とし穴とは（ダイヤモンド・オンライン ） - Yahoo!ニュース" is: "The defect of the 'building condition inspection system' is (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News."
"Towards the vitalization of the secondary housing market, a new system for "building condition inspection" has been established. The transaction of secondary housing is favorable."
The translation for this sentence in English is:  "The market for detached houses and apartments is also on the rise, and the reform market is expanding."
"While the popularity of "station front/station nearby/station connected" words such as "large-scale" and "tower" is concentrated on representative buildings, the reduction of relatively inexpensive new buildings may also be affected by this."
"However, despite viewing the images in this article, the existing (second-hand) housing circulation rate in Japan is still low and remains at a low level compared to overseas."
Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) in 2018 partially revised the Building Trading Act, with the aim of promoting safe and secure transactions of old residences, and started the building status inspection, which is called inspection and is conducted to determine the condition of the building. (<https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf> )
This is a system in which an architect who is familiar with residential buildings checks the current state or condition of the building, including its deterioration, and summarizes the findings in a report that is presented to the buyer.
The English translation for the sentence is: "The Ministry of Transportation is explaining that there are benefits for both buyers and sellers through the introduction of inspections."
"The owner can avoid post-sale claims by conducting a property inspection before the sale, which provides a sense of security to the buyer."
The English translation for the sentence "ひいては競合物件の差別化にもつながるという" is "Differentiation from competing objects is also involved."
On the one hand, for the buyer's side, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the intended secondhand residence and make a purchase, which appears to be a system with many advantages.
"However, in terms of the existing system, the main authority for leading building condition surveys is primarily on the seller's side."
"In addition, I want to pay attention to the point that the notification of the system called 'Inspection' is the only obligation."
In other words, the real estate broker who is responsible for mediation will have an obligation to explain whether or not it is possible to introduce a construction engineer to conduct a building condition inspection during mediation, but it will not be mandatory to actually do so.
The English translation for the sentence is:  "However, when looking abroad, active markets for used goods such as lively America and England already have similar systems in place."
In the early stages of residential sales, the buyer may hire a specialist known as an "inspector" or "building surveyor" to conduct a building inspection.
For example, in the case of America, inspections for secondhand home transactions, which account for 70 to 90% of the market, are being carried out at the state level.
The English translation for the sentence is: "In the point that the 'buyer' leads the inspection, the main feature of the 'seller' main Japanese-style inspection and that of the 'buyer' are greatly different."
"The seller's side is showing the condition of the building as little as possible, and trying to sell it for as high a price as possible, within reason."
"On the other hand, the buyer's side is considering the contents of the investigation and wants to make appropriate repairs so that they can live comfortably."
"Even if it's the same inspection, there is a mistake in the purpose and thoughts of both parties."
"Therefore, the Japanese system is feared as a risky system due to the following points being pointed out."
The translation for the sentence is:  "The scope of inspection for the lead inspector system designated by the state is limited to the minimum."
Due to the lack of detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking important discrepancies by introducing the inspection company to the introducing company (vendor).
"Therefore, an inspection that involves not reporting unfavorable findings to the seller, etc. in order to maintain "face" may be conducted."

With regard to the outline for the tax reform announced by the party last year, major changes have not only affected wealthy individuals but also spread to the middle class.
The reason why is that by changing the inheritance rules and making it so that the "living donation" is the king's way of avoiding inheritance tax, it results in a significant increase in inheritance tax.
The rule for the tax exemption measures for high inheritance tax persistence is "to reduce the taxable assets."
The strongest testamentary disposition before death, which of course includes the assets of the wealthy, has been widely used by company employees, including those who own homes in the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya metropolitan areas, in order to minimize inheritance tax.
