From my point of view, the literature program was formed by women of Balzac's age based on their interests.
"From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky."
"They wrote belletristic literature, of course, from the perspective of those same Balzac age ladies."
"And the psychology and sufferings of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for adolescents."
To young people in general, psychology of heroes is not interesting.

"Germany: The fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable."
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination campaign in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, it is unlikely that two or three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will be sufficient for full protection.
"This is something that the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigel, is convinced of."
According to Die Welt, this happened on Saturday, December 11th.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigelt hopes that the fourth vaccination against COVID-19 can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against the flu".
This translates to "This will help achieve the best results."
"In addition, intensified vaccination may help in combating the spread of a new strain of coronavirus 'Omicron'."
"By the way, the new version is especially dangerous."
"So, the probability of reinfection with 'Omikron' is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains."
This translates to "This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary investigation conducted in South Africa."
Based on this, producers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new coronavirus variant "Omicron."
The study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that the effectiveness of the vaccine is significantly lower at two doses: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are insisting on accelerating the vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
According to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta-virus and omicron-variant coronavirus.
The expert emphasized that the experience of Israel very convincingly shows this.
The English translation for this sentence is: "Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g."
The English translation for the sentence is: "The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®."
"She (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with the intention of being used for subsurface fishing, rather than just for snagging."
This sentence translates to: "These vibes have a higher specific weight than their close analogs, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of their application."
Another recognizable feature is a durable and elastic plastic upper pickup that creates additional shades of vibration when playing vertically or horizontally.
"As a 'winter vibe' in the Bet-A-Vib fishing demonstrates quite aggressive game."
The most noticeable thing can be a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of a needle up and down almost without pauses.
"The deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient for fishing in a limited space, choked with underwater vegetation, kelp and other obstacles, for which a snag is possible."
"In addition, a small deviation is relevant for catching zander in the winter and big pike, especially in the middle of winter when a precise and aggressive presentation of bait is required."
"Reaching the final point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to its original vertical position."
"Not less successfully, Bet-A-Vib is also applied for winter catching pond whitefish."
"To suit her caprices, you can choose from two modifications: with a noisy capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent)."
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib can play tic-tac-toe in a vertical position and provoke a passive kitty who doesn't even react to electric shocks.
"Bet-A-Vib demonstrates long distance and accuracy during fishing."
"This reins are understandable and not capricious, they fit well with leather and braided ropes of even larger diameters."
"For catching bait such as roach, perch, burbot, or pike, other than uniform bait distribution, 'step-by-step', and sometimes with 'chirping' on the bottom, is also effective."
"If you catch in snagged places, you can change the front treble to a double hook, which will decrease the probability of snags."
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable in operation and, as a result, one of the most noticeable.
"With equal success can be used both on relatively small and on quite deep sections."
"All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks."

In Libya, they announced the presence of 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
"This was stated by the Chairman of the Higher State Council of the Republic, Khalid al-Mishri, on Sunday, December 12th."
"At present, there are over 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner Private Military Company in Libya."
They have airplanes.
"They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra."
"They have 30 reaction aircraft on the air bases of Gardabia (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," - as reported by the Anadolu Agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are trying to capture the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "install their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
The English translation for "Сохранить присутствие" is "To maintain presence."
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Djerba, and is noted in the publication of the agency.
The English translation for the sentence is: "Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group enjoys the support of the Kremlin."
"Где еще могут быть наемники" translates to "Where else can there be mercenaries?" in English.
According to the agency, "Wagner" is believed to be active in nine African countries, including the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
"In exchange for these services, the daughter companies of 'Wagner' receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of valuable minerals and natural resources, as well as for the delivery of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries," as stated in the article.
As reported by the media, "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in any law enforcement agencies or legal entities register, and its fighters are not listed in personnel records.
This company is under sanctions from the United States.
Let me remind you, previously the ambassadors of 27 countries of the EU approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the decision of the European Union Council will be approved on December 13th.

"On this background, the Higher Electoral Commission of Libya has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports."

The government of Dubai has fully rejected paper-based documentation - all government services are now only digital.
The government of Dubai has announced a complete rejection of paper-based workflows and a transition to digital technologies.
"All government services for the population will be provided exclusively in electronic form."
This translates to "This is reported by the Emirates' information agency WAM."
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalization that will impact all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council, on Saturday.
"Now, internal and external document circulation in all government institutions of Dubai will only be carried out in a digital form through special information platforms."
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, and so on. The government initiative was also supported by many commercial structures.
The transition to electronic government and document digitization began in Dubai in 2018.
Over this time, as calculated by the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary value.
Previously, the Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days per year.

"Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the level of 2020."
"Production and export of cars in Turkey sharply decreased in November due to devaluation of the lira."
According to Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association, the industry's indicators for the 11 months ended up worse than the previous year's result.
According to the association, in November in Turkey, 115 thousand vehicles were released from the factories, which is 20% less than a year ago.
"Around 75,9 thousand machines were shipped for export, which is more than 25% lower than the last year's figure."
"And if, based on the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector in Turkey demonstrated positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then, based on the results of 11 months of 2021, the release of automobiles turned out to be already 0.3% worse than the previous year's indicator."
The cause of such a fall was a sharp decline in the value of the Turkish lira, which in November depreciated by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.

Pulmonologist Puryazev assumed that people with a weak immune system can easily tolerate the "okmion" strain.
The doctor assumed that people with a weakened immune system may be able to carry it easier than those with a strong protective reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryazev explained why the "okmion" strain of the coronavirus could be dangerous.
The cause lies in the conditions of the virus's origin.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an infected HIV or immunocompromised individual.
That is, he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system during the mutation.
"Because of this, he is more aggressive."
"Because there was no response from the immune system, he became very fast."
"Apparently, he has these spike-belts, thorns, maybe more than allowed, his antibodies did not reduce during mutations," comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryazev.
The doctor assumed that people with weakened immune systems can carry "okmiron" easier than those with a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the organism to something, to any infection, - is not always good.
In such cases, the organism may kill itself.
"This is how it happens with pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old youth dies, while 60-year-old seniors carry on with a cough."
"The immune response of a young person is insane, it is completely inadequate: there, where he could only threaten with his finger, he beats, like a cannon firing at sparrows, - concluded Sergei Puryazev."
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant one is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial or viral.
"If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often only buy symptom relief - all hope is on the body."
"The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is fever, weakness, and nausea."
"Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, tickling in the throat, coughing."
Pain can be on the right or left, abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, they may start vaccinating the upcoming generation from 12 to 18 years old by the end of the year.

Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity are becoming victims of COVID-19.
The authors of the work studied the remaining fat tissue after bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, were also infected, with strong inflammatory reactions observed during this process.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and the flu can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
"Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this as well."
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the reasons for the emergence of dementia and spoke about ways of its prevention in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO data, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, even in familiar surroundings, the person has difficulty orienting themselves.
Gološajkin noted that more often than not, dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
"Some factors increase the risk of developing a disease."
This includes hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role," he said.
"Development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, excessive drinking, disruptions in sleep patterns, and a sedentary lifestyle."
Among the first signs, an expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
The discussion is ongoing as to whether hearing loss can be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its occurrence, said the biologist.
For the prevention of disease, the World Health Organization recommends maintaining a sufficient level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
The English translation for this sentence is: "Previously, the professor of the department of neurology, neurosurgery, and medical genetics at the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education 'People's Friendship University of Russia' named after Patrice Lumumba."

Egypt has returned around 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally removed from the country.
"In the last 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country."
"This was reported by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, in the broadcast of Al-Hayat TV on Saturday, December 11th."
"Since 2011, the Egyptian state has been able to return 29,300 artifacts."
He said, "Only this year in the Bible Museum in Washington, DC, 5300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered."
Abdul Gaoud clarified that all artifacts smuggled through the illegal channel have been registered in the archives.
"Now the employees of the department are working on their return to Egypt."
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and online sales through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks."
The main inspector said that upon returning, cultural values are restored, and then exhibited in museums.
According to his words, one of the returned artifacts was a ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now a part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4th, at which a bust of an age over 3,000 years was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent from the side of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as a god of the sun Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for sale since 1985.
"In what way the relic arrived in Europe is unknown."
Egypt is actively seeking the repatriation of ancient artifacts that were illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers."
The English translation for the sentence "Не учитываются крымские татары" is "Crimean Tatars are not taken into account," and this is correct because Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a separate nation (closely related to Turks).

"Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!"

FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to the personal mobile devices of employees.
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to provide the bank access to their personal mobile devices, according to Financial Times.
The issue is that in Europe and the United States, Swiss banks do not provide corporate communication devices to their employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the existing rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank enjoys the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases, such as when an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work-related tasks.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set the deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
"Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement."

The last year of Sergei Esenin's life in 1925 was productive in terms of creativity, but it was also difficult for the poet and his "ego" in terms of his earthly existence.
"He is already outside of any literary unions, split with imagism, he is on his own, but known, in demand, at times severely criticized by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their shoulders."
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them being true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Sneгина" was written, and 8 books were published, including the collection "Russia Soviet".
The main success was in June 25th of the year when the State Publishing House signed a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
"No poet worthy of the name was ever granted such honor to Sergei Alexanderich, he was the first!"
"Besides, this also promised very good money - according to the contract, the monthly honorarium amounted to 1000 rubles for 20 months (for example, the director of the factory received 300 rubles per month, and the engineer - 200)."
"The resources were needed as never before."
Essenin got married to Leo Tolstoy's grandniece Sofia Tolstaya, it was necessary to arrange family life, provide for sisters Katy and Sasha, and their mother.
At first glance, life seems to be getting organized, there is something to be happy about, but for him it is predominantly colored in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) has materialized:
My friend, my friend.
The English translation for "Я очень и очень болен" is "I am very, very sick."
"I don't know where this pain came from."
The sentence "То ли ветер свистит" in Russian translates to "Is the wind blowing?" in English.
"Over the empty and deserted field."
"To l, as a garden in September"
The English translation for "Осыпает мозги алкоголь" is "Alcohol intoxicates the brain."
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin was very weak, looked bad, and was clearly sick.
The English translation for "Все чаще повторяются загулы, нервные срывы" is "Outbursts of anger and nervous breakdowns are happening more and more frequently."
The cause, likely, is not only in alcoholism...
"However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left."
Let's say it refers to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, an American named Isobel Dunkan, improved his health in a clinic in Paris under Professor Petr Gannushkin (he will again come across Gannushkin two years later, already in Moscow).
Here is the English translation for the sentence: "And here are the testimonies of the poet's drunkenness, scandals on this pretext, and police calls - there are enough of them to scatter dozens of memoirs."
"With the beginning of the 20s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green snake was rapidly developing."
At the end of summer in 1923, Esenin briefly lived with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
It is amazing, but with Yevgeny Yevtushenko, despite his quite good income, he never had his own apartment either in Moscow or in Leningrad, he was always finding himself in rented apartments, hotels or with acquaintances.
Starcev remembers.
"He only came to sleep, and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state."
"One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase landing..."
"Falling, he scratched his face and croaked."
"Having come to his senses a little, he began to cough uncontrollably, spitting out blood all over the floor..."
And even Esenin himself after his travels in Europe and the USA (at that time there was a dry law in the States, but Duncan took with her a decent supply of spirits) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets..."
"I have already reached the end and have stopped remembering people..."
"Well, and drank, of course..."
The English translation for the sentence "А пил я потому, что тоска загрызла" is "And I drank because of the itch."
The English translation for this sentence is: "Pirelli (Pirelli) Scorpion Winter 265/45 R20 108V."
"Winter tire Pirelli Scorpion Winter based on a high-strength rubber and silica mixture ensures long-term effective operation, uniform wear, and resistance to loads."
The linear drawing of the Pirelli Scorpion Winter tire protector, forming ribs, guarantees low resistance to sliding and directional stability.

"Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern interpretation of a budget model in the line of premium class."
The foundation of the mattress is a block of independent double springs Duet.
Inside a large spring, a smaller spring of a softer material has been inserted.
This allows for evenly distributing the load on the mattress.
"From both sides, the mattress is supplemented with a filler - artificial latex."
This is an analog of natural latex, but it is denser and cheaper.
The flexibility and resilience of this material enhances the comfort effect of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.

"On social events in 2021, velvet jackets dominated."
According to sources, the first person to announce their new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
In September at the premiere of the film "It's Not Time to Die" he appeared in a velvet mallard jacket and a traditional "bonnet" butterfly.

The most popular warm velvet jackets with a lining and draped silhouette are dark brown, navy blue, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average price of such models ranges from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively shirts - they choose blazer sets less frequently.
"You can buy them not only from online retailers."
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, blazers made of silk are presented almost in every brand - including Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.

Another important criterion, compliance with which allows to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet blazer, above all, must have a proper advanced haircut with enough volume, - say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Krasavchik Brammell". - Owners of velvet blazers, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets."
"They are simply invited to scheduled secular events, where the dress code is always indicated."
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a waistcoat made of barkcloth with equally formal accessories: classic trousers with stripes, monochrome shirts, silk neckties, patent leather loafers with tassels, and belts with buckles.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Krasavchik Brammell" are confident: it will be inappropriate for a regular servant to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if it's about "a leader who is in charge of this event," then "yes," it's appropriate for them to wear such a thing.
"If a servant is demoted in rank, but his goal is to advance higher in the difficult hierarchy of the company or to earn financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket."
The management will evaluate this phrase with the saying "not on Sennka's head," - believe the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.

We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
"We will intensify our cooperation in accordance with our comprehensive and all-encompassing answer," - it is also stated in the statement.
Earlier today, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed the "unified voice of the 'Big Seven' countries, on whose share of the world's GDP is 50%, and who clearly stated that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."

According to South China Morning Post (SCMP), scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have reached this conclusion.
"Based on the research on antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, it was considered less effective."

The head of Ukraine's defense ministry accused Germany of blocking deliveries of NATO weapons to Kyiv.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Alexei Reznikov, accused the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government of blocking Ukraine's acquisition of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the newspaper Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that in the previous month, Germany had vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for downing drones by Ukraine.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not wait for arms deliveries from Berlin with Chancellor Scholz.
According to his words, the previous leadership of FRG explained their refusal to provide weapons due to the risk of escalating the military conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation" of Russia of part of Ukrainian territory.
"Such a 'non-logical' position, the diplomat is confident, Germany will retain and under the new Chancellor."
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky stated that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
In Ukraine, they are counting on Germany being a "partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic and called for the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

"Scholz arrived in Poland for discussion of 'Nord Stream 2' and EU legislation."
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream 2".
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations of each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, announced that he will call on Scholz to speak out against "Nord Stream 2", which proposes to deliver Russian gas to Germany via Ukraine.
According to Moravecky, Russia can use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin declared that it would assist Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland, ruling that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate European law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new government of Germany, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not publicly commit to halting the operation of "Nord Stream 2" in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress members that they reached an understanding with Germany on halting the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking Congressional staffer reported on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Schulz warned of the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine on Wednesday, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.

"South African scientists announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "omikron"
In South Africa, it was announced that the Pfizer vaccine against "omikron" has low effectiveness.
"Scientists in the South African Republic conducted research and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection."
According to estimates, he (the level of neutralization of "omikron") corresponds to the effectiveness of the vaccine at 22.5% against infection with symptoms, due to which... his ability to protect against infection is called into question. This is stated in the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.

How much hidden sugar in everyday products?
Sugar is not the best source of essential nutrients.
"His excess in diet may lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases."
Consumers should consider that under an unfamiliar word in the product may be indicated a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in caloric content, composition, and glycemic index.
On the label, dozens of names, in essence, indicating sugar can be presented.
One of the most common and frequently encountered names - glucose and fructose.
"Также могут быть другие срытые сахара, такие как декстроза (сахар, полученный из кукурузы), левулоза (фруктовый сахар), меласса (черная патока), сироп агавы и т.д."
This sentence can be translated to:  "This is all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can not only be found in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, and etc."
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what ingredient is used in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Counting the exact amount of sugar is not easy as it requires taking into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
"Therefore, the total amount of sugar may turn out to be significantly higher than indicated on the label."
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for FRG in 25 years.
The new Chancellor of the FRG, Olaf Scholz, stated that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to his words, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, through 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to adhere to the idea that Ukraine should transport Russian natural gas and in the future, as at the moment this resource has important significance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was fixed.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annalena Baerbock, stated that the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the Minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

On the referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the partial results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of residents in New Caledonia voted against independence for their territory during the referendum.
"At the same time, the level of participation in this third voting became significantly lower than in the two previous ones."
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of those who voted supported independence for New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
"The turnout was 43.9%, and more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participated in the elections."
According to the interim results commented on by the agency France-Presse, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the voting.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, considering that a new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago hindered the holding of a full and "honest" pre-election campaign.
Therefore, this non-participation opened the way to the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the residents voted against independence, while in 2020, 53.3% did so.
As stated by separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last election and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12th, at the Élysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is set to speak about the results of this referendum.
The theme of the independence of New Caledonia has livened up the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
A few presidential candidates have spoken in favor of keeping the territory as part of France because it is the "last region of EU presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must definitely remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated multiple times.
"Such a statement was made by Valérie Pécresse, the Republican candidate, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging Calédoniens to remain French."
On the other hand, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not take up the position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
"Premier Minister Jean Casteks, on the other hand, expressed a "strong desire" for the choice of Caledonians to be the choice of France."

Experts have warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9.
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, may lead to cancer.
"This was reported by the Daily Express publication."
According to the specialists, there are strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer.

Kitcin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to carefully monitor the dosage and avoid taking it with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine named folic acid as a substance that slows down aging.
Since it contains, among other things, avocado, Fine recommended that men over 50 years old should eat more of this fruit.
In the United Kingdom, by April due to the omicron strain, around 75,000 people may die.
The forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the UK in the next five months, up to 75,000 people may die if preventative measures are not tightened during the winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported with a reference to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the specialists who are part of the scientific and consultative group on emergency situations at the British cabinet office, it is expected that by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths will be recorded in the country due to the Omikron strain, and around 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
"At the same time, during the peak of the outbreak, hospitals will be accepting more than 2,000 infected patients daily."
"Serious measures to combat COVID-19 may be required to prevent overloading of the National Health Service, if the omicron strain turns out to be more infectious than the delta variant, and currently available vaccines cannot exclude infection."
Previously, the UK's Health and Safety Agency informed: if the speed of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year, there will be around 1 million cases of infection in the country.
"At the same time, by the middle of December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom."
At present, in the UK, 1898 cases of omicron strain COVID-19 infection have been identified, including 633 cases identified in the past 24 hours.
"At the same time, on December 9th, the head of British Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality, this indicator may have already reached 10,000 cases."

"The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world."
"Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight against climate change."
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts has made up 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who want and have the money for a £50 million floating fortress will not decrease, writes "The Guardian."
"However, there are more and more of them."
"This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year."
Brokers say that there has not been such a fuss on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of contracting the virus on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
"If before, all these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now absolutely most of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via video conferencing."
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts in 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford to give it to them," he says.
In the Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
"The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of scarcity, space travel, life on yachts, or flights on private planes cause resentment in society because the elite does not want to share responsibility for changing the climate with the rest of humanity."
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose introducing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of funds, it will be extremely difficult to implement this.
Meanwhile, it only impresses the number of ordered super-yachts, but also their characteristics.
"Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a length of the keel longer than 100 meters."
The Norwegian billionaire, Rekke, is building a yacht named REV Ocean that is 183 meters long.
"After launching into the water, this will be the largest yacht in the world."
On the yacht, a "moon pool" is provided, as well as a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
"On existing super-yachts, ordinary helipads, movie theaters under the open sky, and on some of them, for example, on the yacht of the fighter McGregor - a platform for martial arts. Professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University in the United States, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total number of carbon emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant."
"But it has symbolic significance, considering that there are only around 2000 multimillionaires in the world."
This is just another example of the overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the carbon footprint of millionaires is thousands of times larger than that of a typical planetary resident.
"If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018."
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trace fell on his yacht Eclipse with a length of 162.5 meters.
"Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet."
The owner can call the captain and give a command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of superyachts do not elicit sympathy from other people, as is the case with the wealthiest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent and complains through YouTube that there is no room for her giant ships to dock.
"It is also difficult to understand her appeal to build marinas for ships with a displacement of 50 meters."
"Determined a dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of colorectal cancer."
American scientists have determined what volume of alcoholic beverages in a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
"This is reported by the publication Daily Express."
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
"At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with the increase in the number of times alcohol is consumed."
In addition, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is higher in moderate drinkers than in women.
The exact cause of the development of such a kind of oncology scientists cannot determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, if not all, dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
"But even they do not suspect how developed four-legged pets actually are."
"For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to determine how developed the intelligence is in animals."
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can sequentially react to 89 words or phrases.
"The works of scientists were published in the edition Sciencealert."
"Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they don't understand anything about politics, economics, and art, but they often manage to deceive their owners."
Experts believe that representatives of some breeds show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for definite conclusions.
"Yes, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors."
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of ability to learn, they do not lag behind a two-year-old child.

Gološajkin emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain's blood vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today, doctors do not know any effective ways to treat dementia.
"Therefore, it is necessary to start her prevention in time."
According to him, studying foreign languages and engaging in active communication can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.

The issue is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, although it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit in the waiting room afterward.
"Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that act literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the opinion of the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when there is experience in using the preparation.
He also emphasized that it is important for the nasal vaccine to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity when it is used.
"At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine may not reach its intended destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the injection when their nose is congested."

According to information as of December 9th, "omikron" is registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and significantly modified antigen profile of the "omega" strain of the bacteria suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against the infection and transmission of the variant.
Based on preliminary findings from South Africa, it is suggested that she ("heaviness of the disease" - rare) may be less heavy than with "delivery". - as stated in a technical message from WHO.
The organization notes that all registered cases of "omikron" infection in the EU are currently progressing mildly or asymptomatically.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named.
Former member of the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) of Ukraine, Vadim Denisenko, listed four possible scenarios for the development of events for President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, in 2022.
According to his opinion, the head of state may remain without support from the West, as well as, possibly, make compromises on Donbass.
"About this on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in a publication on the portal 'Glavred'."
The first option that Denisenko called "the ideal storm" envisions Ukraine no longer supporting key Western countries and reaching an agreement about the country's future without its participation.
"Such development of events will contribute to a profound crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023."
"At the same time, prices for key goods that we traditionally export are decreasing, along with internal protests and opposition to the authorities from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups)." - added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all."
"This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems."
"Due to such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine may go for compromises on Donbass, as a result of which there may be a confrontation within the country."
"In the end of summer, the positions of Zelensky will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is 50-55%."
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between unsatisfied groups of population and the president, which may lead to the seizure of control over the security block and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In the course of this variant of the crisis, Zelensky will start "reformatting power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario - the transformation of Zelensky into a "father of the nation."
This could lead to some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be significant enough to elicit a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
"Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of spontaneous disaster, technogenic catastrophe, or aggressive actions of Russia, believes the ex-deputy."
"At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an attack on Ukraine."
In Moscow, it was noted that specifically Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States are increasing military activity near Russian borders.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus in search of signs of life in its atmosphere, according to Sunday's "Actual Camera."
The goal of missions starting in five years is to evaluate the suitability for life of Venus clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds.
"It was previously thought that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet."
"During the third mission, a sample should arrive from Venus."
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it resembles Earth's life or is different.
"If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth."
"If it differs, it is possible that it will become more likely that life was born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder" Mihkel Pajusalu.

"British economist unable to give forecast for 2022"
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022 because, in his opinion, such attempts would lead to failure.
"He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate."
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of the coronavirus, and on second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in the cost of goods is temporary or not.
As indicated by the specialist, it was already clear before the pandemic that "the world of infinite generosity from central banks has exhausted itself" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates taking into account inflation will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that continuation of super-soft economic policy in the context of the pandemic may, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
"In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the question of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and changes in the climate, summarized O'Neill."
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department "Open Investments" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar's rate in 2022 remain, with the potential growth being less significant.

Russians have given auto dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
According to the results of 10 months in 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, as reported by the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
"To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government on supporting citizens and the economy during the pandemic of the coronavirus."
In the past September at a meeting of the heads of states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin spoke, saying that such a sum is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's GDP in 2020.
According to market share in Russia, the Korean brand Kia leads.

"The increase for the Kia brand of Hyundai is even more significant - over 35%, and revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles."

According to the pace of sales growth, fantastic indicators are demonstrated by Chinese brands, who have also significantly increased their financial flexibility this year.
The Russian Lada demonstrates a dynamic growth in income, showing median indicators (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on these cars over the past 10 months.

Regularly update their price lists for their products and other car manufacturers.
"The volumes of the automotive market in Russia will continue to increase in monetary terms - in addition to the shortage of cars, this is also contributed by inflation, as well as the desire of automakers to make up for past losses, experts believe."
In conditions of car deficit, I think that many car manufacturers were able to partially shift the costs of past periods onto consumers that they couldn't include in the price of cars earlier.
The analyst at VTB Capital in the automotive industry, Vladimir Bespalov, is speaking.
I believe that automakers are feeling quite good financially at the moment, maintaining high marginality in their sales.
The indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices observed in 2021, as the prices of new cars are rising faster than inflation, an expert notes.
In the long-term perspective, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bessapov.
"With the growth of the offer of opportunities for price increase, limitations will be limited."
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow and even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to receive their income from volumes, notes independent automotive industry consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to maximize profits from each sold vehicle, notes Burgazliev.
"It is not expected that the volume of machine production will increase at least in the next six months, and in Russia, excitement is further fueled by uncertainty among the population about the future."
"In the context of the market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car purchased a year ago can be sold now for a higher price than the initial cost, an expert notes."
