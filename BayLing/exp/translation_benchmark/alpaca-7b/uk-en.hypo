Good day, thank you for your help. I apologize for the slow internet connection and not being able to send it sooner. Thank you.
Could you please tell me where to go tomorrow to clean up, which key code to use and at what time tomorrow's guests will be leaving, as well as any new guests who will be arriving?
I have to decline your proposal, as I have already found a job.
Excuse me, but I cannot refuse.
Sometimes it seems that my thoughts, when translated into Czech, differ from what I have written in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Hello, I agree to the course.
However, would you mind if we leave earlier?
I do not live in Prague, and there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no alternatives, I will still agree.
Thank you very much.
In Herson, people once again gathered for a protest, but the Russians were unable to disperse them.
The participants of the event told the agency that the people of Kherson had already held a protest rally before the military arrived with equipment.
We managed to hold a protest. The equipment has now arrived. One of the participants told us.
In the past, the citizens used to gather for protests at the city square - in front of the ODA building and the oblast administration.
Currently, Russian troops are controlling the area, including the building, and are using weapons against protesters and kidnapping people.
It was reported that armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kharkiv.
According to Ukrinform, people in Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military is using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders are kidnapping people from the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky bestowed upon Herson the special title "City-Hero".
On February 24, President Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out mass artillery attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.
I often have dreams about my father.
He died the day after my birthday.
In general, things are going well.
Hello, good day.
You did it, just as you wrote and the phone began to charge!
That's great news!
Thank you!
We can meet for an hour or two and then I will go home because I do not have the necessary things with me.

My Oleg also found a job - to clean two apartments, which are rented to tourists.
Apartments in Prague are located.
It will be convenient for you to come to the bank with me on Monday? Or on another day?
Good day, it would have been great if you could have written as you did at 17:00.
That's why I was reading the Bible, the Quran, and other sources in order to find the answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the house that needs to be cleaned?
Will my dreams be pleasant?

They have tickets for April 20.
Please God, let us drive safely.
When you come, please call me on the phone. The doorbell doesn't work.
It would have been better if we could have stayed, but we had to move because the European prices were too expensive.
I need to look at the place and try where it hurts.
He wants to press on all my sore points, he knows which ones.
It has no influence on me at all.
Yesterday, she didn't want to talk about him and his drama.
It is not possible to close the windows when there is still a chance of rain. When there is no more chance of rain, you can close the windows.
I feel uncomfortable in my own skin.

I have already written to you twice :)) but I am making a double circle on the train.
I don't understand, will we be together with the Valyians at dawn?
Did you know that we are cleaning up by ourselves, but you are just supervising?
Could we exchange with you some changes? You in the morning, and I after lunch?
My mother will live here in the dormitory as long as she has to pay for the dormitory.
I want to have a life.
Sasha was not at school today, and she wrote a note to the teacher.
Hello👋 I am sick, so it would be better to reschedule our meeting to next weekend, sorry.
It is important to have a recipe, but it is also important to enjoy baking.
In Ukraine, borscht, vareniki, and other traditional dishes are popular.
I don't have any favorite dishes, I love trying out different dishes from different countries.
What do you like to eat? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something.
The train is late, there are no seats.
Sorry, but we are a bit late.
Lucia, can I help you in the kitchen?
It is great that Julia will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment yesterday evening.
It is very crowded and comfortable there.
Pablo will tell me if there will be a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he has to come to agree on the meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, ceasefire will leave us weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battle for eastern Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - if the Ukrainian military is defeated, the Russians may abandon the negotiating table and reoccupy the previously-recovered territories.
You know, Mariupol is the heart of this war today.
We are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting – our positions will be weaker.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) were people who drew away a great number of enemies.
The stronger our position is in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the country, in the region of the OS, and if they are more solid, then the table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with Russia.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, we may not have to wait for a meeting.
Because Russia will take all the steps necessary to return even to the cities we currently occupy.
They may go and do that.
Our negotiating position will be weak and, perhaps, even uninteresting to the Russian side.
We regret to inform you.
We believe in our result, in our victory...
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the possibility of a diplomatic solution, if they are in us."
People will accept the world however it may be, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something - I do not think that their satisfaction will be any peace on any terms.
If we speak without emotion, war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
Even where there are millions of victims, the war eventually comes to an end.
Yes, we must fight – but for life.
You cannot fight for something when there is nothing left, when there are no people.
Hello, do you have any free spots left for a Czech language course for adults starting from 19:00 on Wednesday?
You can find your family in Kutnya Gora.
These are my two cousins.
Yes, I understand.
I'm not sure if I can finish by 13:00 hours because the apartment is big and there's a lot of cleaning to do.
I will try to clean up quickly, but I don't promise.
I will write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Who is responsible for purchasing expendable materials?

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new quality state.
This is an analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, exploring its current state.
The use of Ukrainian poetic metaphors in contemporary literature allows for an analysis of postmodern contexts, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criteria.
Do you know how to tell online that I have been employed and am no longer seeking assistance?

We are going to work and earn money.
On Monday, we will have a leadership meeting and we will decide when and how to proceed.
I don't understand why I ended up here and I don't know what to do.
I think the right decision is to provide quality assistance to these people instead of many people.
My 16-year-old daughter is looking for a temporary shelter in the Czech Republic, where she plans to study at the University.

My name is Ciara, I'm from Ukraine, I'm 7 years old and I have a mother.
I am looking for a job...but there is a problem, as I cannot stay on my feet for long after the operation, so it is difficult to find something suitable for me.
I am temporarily staying in Prague 9. I am ready to move wherever there is work. I would be very grateful for advice or proposals.
If you don't want to talk to me, I'll be sad.
Why did you think that such experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for something.
Generally, people change, especially spiritually.
I will give you these funds, as the bank will approve it.
Approximately 30,000 hryvnia in debt, plus 30,000 hryvnia to leave you with.
I hope you are doing well, and your grandmother is not calling you bad words.
I am trying to put Sasha to sleep...It is necessary for him to get some rest.

The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who participated in committing military crimes in the city of Butsa, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has reported this on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has published a list of 64 members of the 64th Independent Motorized Infantry Brigade who are directly involved in committing military crimes against the Ukrainian people in the city of Butsa.
The school notes that all war criminals will be held accountable for the crimes they have committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list by clicking on the link.
According to Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In liberated cities and villages, mass killings by Russian military personnel have been documented.
The mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced that 280 people were buried in the communal graves.
The General Prosecutor of Ukraine, Iryna Venediktova, announced that 3 April, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the liberated territory of the Kyiv region.

Good day, I am sorry, but I cannot work with you because I am going to be flying to Canada soon.
Immediately after the colon, there are formal names, slang expressions, and abbreviations used in timetables.
I don't want to bother you, take your time.
I was looking at the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brand names.
A nice outfit at reasonable prices and sizes.
We were at the store on the railway station.
Professions that are offered without knowledge of the language?
It is important if there is a tradition that I need to know so that I can prepare.
I thought about it for a week, but the situation is getting worse, the sirens are constantly wailing.
Tomorrow there may be a bad connection on the road.
I am grateful to every person for their experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that you learn from every experience so that you can avoid repeating mistakes in the future.
Entries should be made in the form of numbered written supplements which are part of this Regulation.
I am sure that there will be no problems with this.

You can try it for free at the beginning.
You can write us an algorithm for payment, and we will pay it ourselves.
The paper that children receive at the end of the school year is a table, and they receive a certificate upon birth and marriage.
Wow! He is an experienced driver! But I don't know if it's better. I'm nervous for the walls of the apartment.
There is a task that needs to be filled in the life story, on Czech...
I will try to hurry. I still have to sign some documents.
Your wife is not angry that you are using the phone.
In my daily prayers I thank God and the Theotokos for you.
Let their love and warmth envelop you this night.
My heart belongs to you.
If I come immediately after the war?
The place, day, and time will be refined according to interests and capabilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
I have two months' rent money saved up, and I'm very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of bestial torture of civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of executed and shot people shocked the entire civilized world.
People are wondering how such a thing could have happened in the 21st century! How?!
Nothing surprised me. I was expecting exactly what happened...
I brought children and elderly parents from Kyiv to the second day of war.
Then the colleagues with children, and only after that returned to work in the capital.
From 2014 onwards, I consistently helped the Ukrainian army and never doubted for a moment that my family would not be spared if the town of Kyiv was occupied.
He was absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten Communist-Bolshevik regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandparents was executed in the prison town of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the Security Service of Ukraine gave my grandfather's case to review: the file was over a hundred pages long, but the verdict was simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, but he denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was a free person, poor, never went to the peasants.
The fact that they lived in huts and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the peasant and his young children to death.
The relatives did not learn about the burial place.
My grandmother said that they took almost a hundred people from the village and killed them all, except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the court case, the defendant is named Stanislav Shary.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I won't be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An apple from an apple tree is known to fall...
The execution squad, which had ordered the death of the peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing his grandfather's case, he became interested in various information resources.
In Russia, there are wonderful (without sarcasm) informational resources, such as "Bessmertny Barak", which accurately reflect the events of those years.
In modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD officers have found ways to punish and eliminate almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their predecessors in the 70s and 80s.
People who found mass graves of Stalin's repression victims and publicly wrote the names of the perpetrators - first discredited, then destroyed.
They found child pornography files on the computer, so they sentenced her to prison, and she died soon after.
The KGB is currently killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you surprised by their actions now?!
There are the most base aspects of human nature concentrated there.
A thousand-year-old nomadic tradition was overlaid with slavery and imperial chauvinism in the 16th to 19th centuries.
They conducted a bestial genetic experiment by removing intelligence during several waves of the red terror.
Look at the half-French film "Chekist" from 1992, and that's it.
You have seen my photos in a swimsuit.
Can you ask your friends what I can buy from the store?
Excuse me, I don't know who to ask.
I wanted to ask where the children went, since Galya couldn't tell me.
Lubosch, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to leave tomorrow. He can go because he has not yet looked at the car at the station.
We find it very difficult to worry about you so much.
We really appreciate your help! Thank you!

What do the girls do after they return from school?
We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center, and the conditions were good.
There are a lot of men here drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, the music is really loud, it's overwhelming, the smell of cigarettes and drunk men… it's terrifying to sleep if you're honest.
Please help me with housing, and for money, please be kind.
There will be safety and comfort there.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is overpowering, since they are smoking.
You are terrified. One of them is barely standing, something is screaming, and it doesn't like it. Very scary.
Please help if you can.
We understand each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful garden, nice carers.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, we are very grateful to you❤️
Good evening Stefani, Agata wants to participate in the game, she's excited about it 😉
We need that window.
We are not yet prepared to pay such money, but we will wait for assistance, and then we will plan something.
How can I get to the apartment to clean up?
I will inform you when I am at the main entrance and you will open it.
I wanted to take a look at the cake for Karina.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday went very well.
We were talking about children with special needs and the education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shkova presented me as a worker at Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the cat.
Everyone is watching the page on Facebook.
They asked you to send greetings and tell them it's interesting to read the news.
They were speaking about the Roma people, who have privileges in Ukraine.
We agreed that if the parents and the child don't understand Czech, I can help them after work over the phone.
I need to change my bedding, two sets.
I celebrate these days.
I have free time, and we are only going to the Easter celebrations.
Thank you for your work today.
I really enjoyed it, thank you for organizing.
It is 37.7 degrees Celsius in the evening in Galinka.
At General Chaper's there is a very slow line of people waiting.
Everyone has a chance.
In order for love to be real and mutual.
I don't know why people get married in Europe, but here in our country, people get married for both selfish and mercenary reasons.
I have a problem if I don't love someone, nothing will come of it.
Yes, we took her home and brought her immediately.
She was very grateful, she was even crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
If possible, there may still be an old blanket and quilt.
However, it is not obligatory. Only if you want. I am very grateful to you.
I am sorry for him.
They stabbed my best friend.
I had many questions to God, why my life was filled with situations that left me feeling hopeless.
Are the small grocery stores open? I need to buy bread and other products.
I decided to go away and you gathered together.
We are still orienting ourselves in the area and don't know where everything is. We have been searching for an hour and have been walking back and forth. The coats are not suitable, so we need two large ones.
Even now, I am thinking of you, and you wrote to me.
Your father only speaks Russian or is there someone else in the family who speaks Russian?
Children can come and play in the courtyard.
That's great, let's take the risk!
I am glad to have met you.
She was talking to Vladimir about where to find a place to stay while they were looking for their own place. She said they needed to take the metro to the museum, which was an institution that could help them find a place to stay.
For a small one, I will jump over the barrier 😂🙃😂
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
It was nice on the fourth, if possible.
I can't call a doctor because I haven't had another food inspection yet.
I can't call him because I have run out of money.
I can't fill my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking and I can't fill my Ukrainian bank card.
I cannot change the tariff to get normal calls and internet to refill the number.
I am going to lose my mind.
The price is not right, isn't it? What did you mean by that?
I am ashamed to sit without work.
Just wrote that I'm at school.
Excuse me, I was very troubled.
They are closer to leaving Ukraine to find out exactly where they are going.
There is a question mark in everyone's life.
That's okay. Our sizes don't match. Everything has to be measured.
I am looking for everything for the home and for the child.
People always accept me when I stay in the chapel. They always ask me whether I need anything or not. I feel ashamed to ask myself.
I just got home, and I'm having breakfast now.
Please explain, if you can, why there is no one.
It is not possible to respond without a resume.
I can't tell my mom this.
I was feeling a bit overwhelmed before we left the apartment...last night...
God bless you, maybe I will sleep right away, just a little bit to rest.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Susana, please help me. I don't understand why this amount is so high. It's for two people, but I don't know why it's so much.
Yes, you can make copies of your passport when you need it.
We have one of the best schools in the region.
You already seem to be having fun talking to me, and even though I'm not used to it, I'm starting to like it.
I turned to the caritas, they offered me a temporary place to stay for a week - two but I need a permanent place to stay where I can be with my child, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to find.
The flowers bloomed. Everything is normal. Everyone rested and looked very nice.
European Truth reports that Welt writes, citing sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, a corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the educational kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As proposed, the Boxer infantry fighting vehicle is available for 1.2 billion euros.
While engaging the enemy in battle, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire its shells beyond 30 kilometers.
According to the Ukrainian government circles, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps that will be created will be filled with industry on the second stage.
The first new guns can be installed within 30 months after the contract is signed, i.e. by the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Are we going to do this in the first half of the day, or the second half?
Thank you for finding me. I will reply. Thank you.
I will go to work tomorrow without having to pass a commission, and when my doctor gets better I will pass the commission correctly, right?

Show me how to go to the center of the city?
I will share my thoughts with you.
Marriage is a mystery between two people who do not discuss each other with their families or friends.
Men and women decide family matters on their own, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we will be together.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we are coming with Maryana and your family.

You have to try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, it's life.
We are going to sleep.
Thank you for such a nice and cheerful day.
We really enjoyed it.
We feel at home with ourselves.
The children told their parents and grandparents about how wonderful it was for them.
Happy Holidays! From the girls, the best wishes! 😉
We were amazed.
I hope that my son will come out of this butcher shop alive.
We are going today, who knows what might be needed.

Do not worry about that.
It is not new, but it has been used, but it is not needed.
Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map to see where it is located.
I don't know how many free places there are this week so I can't plan anything with furniture. Finally, I want to look at that apartment and then understand which furniture I need.
Thank you for your patience, it was a long day and it was difficult to adjust.
That's enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, have the chance to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you like it.
For the child, there is a crib and a changing table, items have been found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me, but do not give up the last chance 🤫😟😉🙃
I want to make a haircut which is called a hat.
Oleg has the flu - a ghost and a cough. It's better not to bring Jan with you, so as not to get infected.
I will be a bit late - around 8 PM. Can I?
I don't want to be confused with you.
I am suffering, so that everything will be alright!?
We had never even talked about this!
I understand how important this is for you!
I have reached the peak of my ambition!
How do you feel today? After the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, feeling bad.
Try to understand.
I was frustrated that we started translating the test yesterday poorly.
I will ask Grigory Denisenkov or Yonak whether he can help me with some mathematical concepts.
Could I be useful to them?
If there is a possibility, I would like to review mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is difficult in general, but we must work with the Circle to get it right.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We too are very hopeful.
She is very happy to receive any gift.
I wanted to connect my Czech number to the internet.
Yesterday, at stop 402 bus, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is all alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
We have agreed to be friends.
Yesterday evening, I thanked God for this child, because it was the first person from Ukraine to feel my love.
Room 29 is designated for receiving and processing applications for assistance.
It turned out that I had bought an extra map.
It is not necessary, I am just a simple person.
She was afraid that no one had come.
I didn't go. Instead, I taught myself how to turn the lights on. The most important thing you taught me was how to switch the lights on.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Eighty years ago, at the Memorial Center of the Holocaust in Kyiv, we commemorated the massacre of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke about "a common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We also have a responsibility to protect this foundation, which is part of our duty related to our history.
If "evil spirits" of the past appear today in new clothing, – he said, – our response as Germans can only be: never again!
The struggle must continue.
Today, Russia is attacking a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of innocent people, starving the inhabitants of blockaded cities, and giving them a slow and painful death from diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, resembling the shootings at Babi Yar.
More than a month, the Germans see it in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and supplying weapons that were previously unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons, needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just protesting the swastika.
It means to fight against all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy path without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you.
We agree, please organize an excursion, and we will meet there.
Everyone but Lydia was sick. There was a new virus circulating.
I will do it tomorrow.
I use this template instead of a map.
Whistle for delaying documents.
The taxi cost me 2000 hryvnia.
Sergey Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO was no longer a distant prospect.
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those polled supported it.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbass war, the number of opponents of NATO began to decrease, while the number of its supporters increased.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO – over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in the context of the war, there is much criticism of the Alliance and its members – for the delay in supplying weapons, the refusal to close the sky, and the reluctance to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations to join the Alliance if it cannot stop the war and Russia is able to prevent Ukraine from obtaining reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Кляті питання" together with the editor of "European Truth" we discuss how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why NATO is being criticized for it, why our membership perspective in NATO is closer than ever before, and why the security guarantees being discussed with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is going on here?
My application is being reviewed.
I sent it through this mobile app.
We need to go to the congress center to find out how to do it, because they did the paperwork in Poland, but they didn't give us a visa.
We will definitely write to you!

Yes, it was a sick heart.
I had strong feelings for this person, but he didn't behave very nicely and I left him.
After a while he returned and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Later, he called to say that he had had heart surgery.
He asked me to just chat with him, but it became a problem for me.
I psychologically supported him almost a year.
During this time, we had a lot of conversations.
I had problems at work simultaneously.
Your support also helped me at that time.
We help each other.
I was thinking, it might be necessary to look at it differently.

I bought two packs of cigarettes and my mother bought two packs.

My mood was lifted.
Good, let's do something else, as I don't want to sleep, I keep having nightmares...
God never late, always in the right place and time.
I don't think he wants to rob me.
I understand the value of unqualified labor and realize that I cannot have such work here in Kyiv that I had at home and the money I earned at home, I will not be receiving here.
I can't just sit around and do nothing, because bad thoughts start to creep into my head if I'm not occupied with something physical.
At the airport, documents can be processed from 7am to 7pm, but if you arrive outside of those hours, you can just wait.

Do activities on Mondays and Tuesdays differ?
Thank you very much. You do so much for our family! We are infinitely grateful to you.
In order to find the basin, you need to ask for directions.
However, that's my opinion.
My grandfather gave my dad the skateboard and the skateboard ramp, and my dad gave it to me. I used it at home and I skated it, so it has to be mine.
I got up at 9 o'clock and am now preparing breakfast.
I am ashamed to be speaking to you in my free time. I hope I am not too boring.

The Russian army is threatening to launch rocket attacks on Kyiv: they say they have never done so before.
Konashenkov: "We will see attempts by Ukrainian forces to carry out diversions and strikes against Russian targets on Russian territory."
If such cases continue, the Russian forces will strike at the decision-making centers, including Kyiv, which they had previously refrained from doing.
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, pieces of Russian rockets, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a high-rise building in the capital's Poznaki.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valeriya Lobanovsky Prospekt.
On March 1, the Russians fired a missile at the TV tower near Babi Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian rockets that were flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14, the fragments of a broken rocket destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential neighborhood in Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the Retroville shopping mall on Vinogradar, resulting in the death of at least 4 people.
Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, announced on April 13th that residents of the capital who had been evacuated from the city should not yet return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket attacks on Kyiv, and there are also many mines and unexploded ordnance in the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks in Russia in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army towards civilian population.
On April 1 near Belgorod in Russia an oil base allegedly exploded due to a Ukrainian air attack.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgorod announced that a "Ukrainian missile" had fallen near the city.
It is evident that elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing cold water on the idea that NATO fighter jets will be able to intercept Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
Alex Zelensky speaks less with them, more with their voters and the general public.
By his speeches in parliaments and before the crowds of tens of thousands in the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was impossible for his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine, he convinces European nations, which elect those politicians.
These speeches, this refined blend of strength, tenderness and time, gradually reach their goal.
While 70% of his citizens support this idea, Biden categorically opposes its closure.
Although Paris and Brussels are pushing for Ukraine to speed up its entry, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered as a fraud.
The money you earn is better given to those who need it more.
I can come to you and we will solve the problem together. I am here to help.
The air is clean, plus 😀

You are all doing well.
You are living your usual life, going to work, planning purchases, vacations.
You have a dream.
You are planning to buy that dress that you saw yesterday at the shopping center.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain cannot process this.
He is clinging to the old reality.
You call the robot to find out if you are supposed to work today, or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Something will become clear.
Hope... that's not for long.
We are currently discussing... something will be done.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where am I going? I have no one with me and nowhere to go.
I have 50 dollars in my pocket. We spent all of our money at home.
Many of our managers have not given us our wages.
Where am I going? To whom do I need to go? How am I supposed to provide for my children? Where am I supposed to live?
You cannot take many things with you.
You didn't take anything from home... so you decided to drive 1000 kilometers.
Do you know what you will be eating tomorrow, yes or no.
Every day, you pull the children around the whole city of Prague.
What's next? We don't know. How much is it? We don't know. The children are asking for candy. You can't afford it. It's too expensive.
There is no such thing as a free lunch.
We have a choice - to stay and put our children in danger, or to try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy to receive the hearts and things that the children had given her when she arrived at school.

In Ukraine, the leaves are falling off the trees.
Could you please tell me what age do you mean?
Is 8 years old an appropriate age for my daughter?
We are looking for a place to stay for 3-4 days while we are visiting Czechia to obtain passports for visas to Canada.
There are a lot of people at the bus station and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for just one day, but it's far away and the journey by train would be difficult for the child.
She decided to look for an apartment in Prague or near it.
No, we are organizing.
Yesterday's devices were put away.
I can't change the password when I click on a link, because it gives me an error:

The Czech Republic began issuing visas after March 22, 2021, for me.
At that time, they set up such stamps and then compared them to the originals.
The Central Election Commission of Ukraine is responsible for the administration of the Zhovtnevyi Vyborchyy Okrug Ukraine (ZVO Ukraine), which includes voting precincts located outside of Ukraine and consists of diplomatic missions and consulates as well as military bases where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed in Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Why are you angry with me?
I am going to take a picture in the bathroom.
I don't need the money anymore, I have borrowed it from my friend for a long time. 😊
I wanted to say that I had already connected my Czech mobile number.
I did not need any other equipment, I went to the operator O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I do not need any other equipment.
Thank you. It is very difficult, not working and I can't.
You said that your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. It is very necessary for you too.
We don't have enough blankets, quilts, and pillows. Children don't have pajamas and nowhere to sleep.

That would have been great, but I know there were no free spots, and in general they teach not very well.
You have a meat grinder to make sausage? We have one, but it doesn't work.

Yesterday your mother said something that hurt you.
She cannot tell them everything she wants, and she does not understand everything they are saying, but she arrived at the market yesterday with a wonderful attitude.
Today also went to school.
I saw my mother Christina, but she didn't even say hello.
Those apples look delicious, what kind are they?
President Andriy Yermak announced that Russia has started a "false operation" to give us weapons from our allies.
They understand that they are losing the war, realize their own inferiority, and are desperate to gain an advantage by any means possible.
For example, one of the last pranks - perhaps the destruction of the transferred Slovakia S-300.
Prime Minister Edward Heath refuted this information.
What will happen next? We know several scenarios. We can call one of them.
They may launch fake news that Ukrainian soldiers surrender their weapons and massively switch to the Russian army's arsenal.
I want to warn you about these fakes.
The weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces only send the enemy to the other world.
Thank you for your kindness, how much will the teddy bear cost and will it work in the summer?
To each his own strength.

Then I will not help you. There are no chances in Brno. The nearest house in Příčina.
Thank you for your help. We found an apartment, but we need a bed and a sofa, and we would like to know where we can buy them as our budget is limited, thank you very much.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the appearance of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as "provocation".
The Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern told journalists in Wellington on April 4th that the Russian military's attacks on Ukrainian civilians deserve condemnation.
Russia must answer to the world for what they have done, – she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its battle against Russian invasion.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents "violations of international law".
Reports surfaced that hundreds of peaceful civilians were executed and left lying in the streets of the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine by Russian troops who had occupied the area for several weeks.
Photographs depicting bodies of allegedly executed civilians with bound hands shocked many and led to calls to increase sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4th that there are indications that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Bukch.
What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures, said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be targeted at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Bucha.
We will make sure that those who committed war crimes will not go unpunished, said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3rd, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova rejected the accusations as a "provocation".
She claimed that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
In this case, it appears that the fact that these statements were made shortly after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts as to who "ordered" this story, said Zakharova.
The Russian Ministry of Defense previously claimed that the images of Bukchy were "another staging of the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
The United Nations Security Council was requested by Moscow to convene on April 4th to discuss the "provocation" of the Ukrainian radicals in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4 released a statement announcing the "investigation" of Ukraine for spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a "genocide" in the city, and said the Kremlin leaders must come to Bakhchiv to see what their military has done.
I want all the heads of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out, – said Zelensky, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a shared responsibility.
He said, "For these murders, for these tortures… He shot him in the face."
He stated that President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military must bear responsibility for the actions of their troops in Ukraine.
When we find people with their arms tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand, said he about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a town approximately 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
A reporter from the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town on April 2.
He saw 10 bodies on the street.
Journalists from the Associated Press saw at least 21 bodies in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of nine people, all civilians, were scattered across the land near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears that the victims were killed at close range.
In general, the Ukrainian government stated that at least 410 peaceful citizens were found in the area of Kyiv, which was controlled by Russian forces last week.
Thank you, we have bought everything on the list.
They said: "Kiev is not there". How the bandits illegally exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, killings, and torture.
This list has one more point which currently has less information - the evacuation of local population to the enemy's territory.
Approximately in the middle of March, Russian occupiers "evacuated" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements on their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed president Lukashenko effectively handed over to Russian military polygon.
The Ukrainian Truth found the missing Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" is going on and if there are ways to return to Ukraine.
The heroes of this text volunteered to evacuate beyond Ukraine under psychological pressure and desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and still in contact with their families.
However, due to the statements of the Ukrainian government, many citizens were forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus.
In Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff and children from a maternity hospital, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian champion swimmer Yosyp Zatsepynsky.
Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander received a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the settlement.
The family settled on the military base, although it was civilian.
Denis and Marina had gathered their terrifying suitcases, but they were unable to evacuate in time on the morning of the 24th of February.
There were no cars in them, but the suburban buses had already stopped taking people.
They saw the helicopters with the letter V following them, then the first missiles arrived.
One of them struck a neighboring building.
The family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, when the Russian military evacuated them to Belarus.
Approximately 40 people were hiding in their basement.
They did not all decide to go.
At 6 pm on the 24th of February, people arrived who were speaking neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
There is someone who is eating. – I say, "Come out!" – "There is someone who is eating."
They searched me, patted me down, and asked if I had any weapons.
They questioned all the men, if they had served in the army.
They told the women to come and be defended by Ramzan Kadyrov.
That was a Chechen OMON, even not military, young men years 25-35.
They said: "We helped the Ukrainians, Sashko Bily (commanded a contingent of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war – UP), now we have come to help you.
They asked us on the third day what was missing.
We said that the water was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods under the pretext that "they will take everything equally", and brought us 6 bottles.
There is still video online where children are thanking Kadyrov for the food.
They brought the stolen goods from the store and said, "We know this is wrong, but we really need the video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
Nobody wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful row.
Our child says: "You have 7 days to give us our phones - they are laughing.
They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They did not want war, but Ukrainians support them anyway: "Putin is a puppet, but we can do nothing, because our families are there."
They mainly did not fight, but instead rode around to steal stores and committed robbery.
They brought her a Georgian ribbon, tied it to one leg, and called it "the recruit".
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence service worked... When they beat them at Buchenwald, so much so that they didn't even take the dead with them, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
Moreover, we had detachments – Chechens did not know each other in the first days, they asked passwords to identify their own or foreign.
They were here on the 13th of March, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by an Omsk military detachment.
They placed 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses – ours constantly got stuck in it from "Baikal".
They came and told us that the USSR no longer exists, but there is "Azov" and, according to their words, "Azov" is in Ukraine.
Kiev had already surrendered by the beginning of March.
A Russian man came to us and said that there will be an evacuation.
We were listening to the radio – they mentioned Bucha, Hostomel, thought, and maybe they even gave us the "green corridor".
When we first gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
They are saying: "We are taking you to Belarus, and then, maybe, to Rostov."
We don't want to go either way.
They replied: "Leave your children's psyches alone!"
They herded us into the basement and began to shoot from behind the house - with grenades or with machine guns.
Then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
They eventually agreed to take us to Belarus, promising to give the border guards and the Red Cross.
A portion did not leave, saying that it was for traitors of the homeland - supposedly, "you will be shot and your organs will be sold."
We were driven through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burned-out vehicles, and broken technology, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the technology away.
There are a lot of cannibals, buried technology and soldiers.
At the Belarusian border "Komar" we passed an improvised control, many people were without documents because they had burned.
We were lodged in the tents of the Red Cross, and given tea.
Here we hear the shots! A rocket is fired, and we can see the trail – "Iskander" has worked in Kyiv.
Although the Red Cross said "No, they are flying and turning at the border".
We have education in aviation, so we understand that.
They loaded us into the bus and drove us to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His boss, Vyacheslav Stepanovich, says: "Here I am, from Chernivtsi.
I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they catch these thieves.
The poor people suffer!
He is such a great guy!
He will say it, or it will be.
They offered to give interviews to the Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium said to us: "You are traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least they were called that) spread disinformation, saying that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed and were afraid to leave Belarus.
We decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents – our daughter did not have a foreign passport.
He was to receive it on Monday, but the war began on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, they did not help us, and at the train station they said that no one will take us in an bus without passports.
Here I will say that the Belarusian volunteers helped us very much.
We were settled in Minsk, and the accompanying was provided.
They did not hold me at the sanatorium by force.
Our migration representative said that you can stay here up to two weeks because Belarus is not part of Europe, and there are no payments here.
We found a transport who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
As we drove by Mosyr (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UA), we saw launches of ballistic missiles over Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, beautifully lights up, and then fades.
People who got on the bus in Mogilev said that Russians were constantly shooting from the polygons.
I don't want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman said that she would break something if he was called.
Northern Belarus, where Minsk is located, in general do not believe.
You are lying, we are a peaceful people.
They do not accept that their polygons are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, our friends waited for us, who brought us to Estonia.
We are currently registering, deciding what we will do next.
There are as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian flags now.
Marina lived on the military base in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
She phoned her nieces and nephews and asked them to gather the most essential items and documents.
They went to sleep in the basement of their neighbor's house.
Marina couldn't go back home and in principle won't be able to – there is no longer a house.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
You will not be able to find it on Mondays somewhere in the center.
Thank you, we are always happy to have you!
Thank you for the agreement, it was nice.
In this small apartment, there is no Wi-Fi, and most of your questions are answered by me now, but the children have no internet on Mondays.
Will we be living with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this family ready to accept us?
Even a leaf from the tree falls with its knowledge.
Children are learning online, I am a salesperson and a cook, but I can also work as a police officer or a cleaner, so Mariana is a specialist in multiplication and she can work from home, while her friend has no specialty, so she is a general worker.
You can do it better than that.
The mayor of Buči, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced joyful news – Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The invaders were expelled from all of Kyiv Oblast the next day.
The joy that Ukrainians should have felt in that moment was overshadowed by fear and hatred, since it became known that in one single town of Buča, Russians had shot at least 280 peaceful inhabitants.
They were simply killed on the street, where they were bound and shot in the face, some of them were minors.
They found the village elder Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor, and their son Alexander, who had been kidnapped on March 23rd.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a common grave, Igor was in the sewer.
Beside the highway, 20 kilometers from Kyiv, the bodies of several naked women, wrapped in a blanket, were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go, no one will be at home.
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday I was supposed to deliver it, but no one contacted me and the package was not delivered, and on the website DHL it was said that the recipient could not be found.
They sent the package to the post office and specified the address of the department.
Can I have it?
I used to go there every day a few times, the river was very close to the house, but now I hardly ever go, I don't have the time and sometimes I don't even want to, I only go with my sister 🙂
Could you please tell me who sent this house?
They asked me to go with them to the exhibition to help them get visas.
Almost an entire day was spent. Tired from people.
That is a nice house and we can arrange it very well.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons, which are provided by western partners, have arrived too late.
President Trump said in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth".
All the equipment, whatever they are sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, what now?
I can see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, which is really true.
Some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the cost of these changes, - said Zelensky.
The president replied that Ukraine did not receive enough weapons to make a difference in the war.
The President also said that, if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have taken a different form.
She would have unfolded differently, we could have fought together with our close neighbors.
He added that even though there was a war, it still wasn't certain.

Grishko has gone to the woods but it's not that simple... He's crying a lot.
A new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden today.
I didn't even try to open the door, but she still called.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work some days for how many hours I receive.

We are hiding the truth about the war from our grandmother.
As long as it is possible.
However, in Plymki (cat – up) on the paws and hind legs is thin fur – it may be due to stress, diet and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons have been removed, but stress still depends on me, unfortunately.
A pimple, unlike a witch, is not deaf, but can hear and detect explosions.
Thanks to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her niece was able to live with her "incognito".

When her friend started talking, I gave her the receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then 2 hours sang.
The radio was always by the bed.
Most of the time, the grandmother spends in her room.
She was able to remain unnoticed by me.
If I heard the sound of her footsteps, I hid in my room.
She hid the receiver and television from her.
Then she called all the people she communicates with. There are 6-7 of them.
She asked her to talk about anything but war.
I was sleeping with my girlfriend, she was there from the very beginning and until the end.

The British soldier, who was defending Mariupol, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British soldier, who is a member of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is defending Mariupol, said to his friends and family that they will surrender their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Eidin Esslin's Twitter page, a British soldier who served in the Ukrainian Armed Forces from 2018, with a reference to his family and friends, Atlas News with a reference to his friend who spoke to him.
He told us: "We have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have run out of food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope, the war will soon end.
Details: Elshin served in the 36th Independent Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is participating in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
The journalists from the BBC contacted Mrs. Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her over the phone that they were planning to surrender.
Friend of military Brendan Philips also confirmed to journalists that in their last telephone conversation, Iselin said their plans for surrender.
According to his words, the brigade's ammunition and food supplies have run out.

The Bolsheviks avenged their losses in battle by playing to their fullest.
They executed teacher Dmytro Pavlicko, his unknown name relative, Boris Oleksenko.
Their bodies were thrown into a deep pit, which was filled with earth.

Sometimes someone would run from house to house.
On the streets, one would often encounter the bodies of those executed by the Bolsheviks.

The Verkhovna Rada adopted the law 7176, entitled "On the Implementation of Monitoring Potential Threats to National Security in the Economy Sector".
It is surprising that the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere is… the place where the meetings of the board of directors of state-owned companies and state-owned banks are held.
The initiators of the legislative project consider that decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in an imaginary Kyiv may somehow solve the issues of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but we don't know of any company that has had to physically hold board meetings at their location.
The potential threat of this law is clear – it is a great foundation for wiping out all achievements in the heavy reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing personal management.
That was in 2015.
Why are state-owned companies required to have supervisory boards and who should belong to them?
Moreover, if one unpatriotic slogan "soars" one harmful law, then tomorrow may soar other – for example, it is possible to cancel the system of state purchases through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There is a lot that can be blamed on the war.
That initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the legislative project 7176.
This provision was added to the comparative table of the draft law 5397 on February 22.
It has been circulating among certain popular candidates for some time now.
We will examine the arguments used to justify the adoption of the law in order to demonstrate its possible consequences.
Then we will provide our proposals on how to manage state-owned enterprises during wartime.
The First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the necessity of this innovation by risks of losing the internet and other means of communication, which prevents remote work of supervisory boards.
Other words, the risk is that the supervisory board may not be able to take the necessary decisions due to which the company's operations may be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can it prevent the transfer of members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
We find ourselves in a rather cynical situation, when the majority of the board members (who constitute the majority of the total composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
Moreover, it is likely to lead to a loss of cohesion, which is necessary for the decision-making body to take any action.
Instead, appointing new independent members to the supervisory board will not be possible, since the law stipulates the need to conduct a competitive selection process, which usually takes 3-4 months.
It is likely that the proposed law will not be able to save the possibility of taking decisions, but instead will lead to this!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmytro Naluh gives other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he points out: "Many enterprises, including the defense-industrial complex (DPC), are currently in need of relocation" and it is difficult to imagine "discussing addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom".
For starters, there are almost no state-owned enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The State Military-Industrial Commission, which in essence is in charge of managing almost all of the defense industries in the country.
Even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a voluntary basis.
The full power of authority in "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the general director, who will take decisions regarding the necessity of relocation of any particular enterprise of the Concern.
In addition, this argument does not stand up to criticism since the draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation that regulates the activities of state-owned companies.
Dmytro also presents arguments that can be categorized as "emotional" on his Facebook page.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing in common with increasing the efficiency of state companies and banks, but let's try to dismantle some of them: respectable foreign experts, upon hearing the word "war" in 2021, leave Ukraine, but remain members of the supervisory boards of Ukrainian companies with full salaries in the several hundred thousand hryvnia range, while Ukraine is actually suffering from the war.
First, manipulation is the majority of such members of the supervisory boards never lived in Ukraine and only periodically visited.
They are leaving Ukraine unfairly.
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This instrument is widely used in world practice, ranging from business to education and medicine.
It is not necessary to forget that membership on the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
Usually, such people have other occupations, and electronic communication helps them in this.
Third, these claims are only directed at foreigners.
Why doesn't Mr. Dmitry express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards, which are Ukrainians?
They are not located at the place of their companies.
To words, this is not the first populist attempt by parliamentarians to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is merely a convenient opportunity.

In the Boryspil, Vyshhorod, and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupation, a heightened curfew will be introduced for two days.

From 21:00 April 2nd to 06:00 April 5th, restrictions will be in effect in these cities and villages.
According to the head of the local VA, it is absolutely prohibited to be on the streets or in other public places, to move by transport or on foot.
The residents can leave the building only when the alarm is sounded to go to shelter.
These restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demined territories.

The curfew in the rest of Kyiv region will last from 11 PM to 6 AM every day.

The three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay signal boxes at Osipevichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains, were detained by the authorities.
The source is "Радыё Свабода", the rehabilitation center "Вясна", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, cited by the state news agency "BelTA".
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30th, with the help of special forces "SBR" three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one of them was injured.
According to the data, the men were actively resisting and trying to escape.
Security measures were implemented with weapons.
One of the detained has been injured and is currently in a medical facility.
He was given medical assistance at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Genadiy Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railway of RB will be stopped by the use of force."
On April 6, it became known that the police had detained another employee of the Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranavichy depot "BŽD" and the administrator of thematic resources "BŽD" in "Vkontakte" and "Classmates" Valentin Samasyuk.
He is currently in an unknown state and is being reported by @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 railway workers were detained for sabotage.
We are reminded: The formation of BYpol, announced by Lukashenko as extreme, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on objects of railway transport and infrastructure within the framework of the "Peremoga" plan.
The Belarusian "railway partisans" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in such a way.

The United States is prohibiting investments in Russia and imposing sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks in Russia, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This sentence is saying that something is being said on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, while Alfa Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that are related to the U.S. financial system, and will prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the US will impose a full ban on new investments in Russia.
President Joe Biden will sign a new order prohibiting US citizens from investing in Russia, regardless of their location.
This decision is based on over 600 international companies' resolutions to leave Russia.
The White House said that the exit from the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other suppliers of services, such as legal and consulting firms.
The United States has imposed new sanctions against Russia, including restrictions on major Russian state-owned companies in the critical sectors.
It will prohibit U.S. citizens from engaging in any operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets located in the United States.
The detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day in the fourth.
The last part of the package is to block the activities of adult children of Vladimir Putin, his wife and daughter, as well as members of the Security Council, including former President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions will disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all their assets in the United States.

Good evening, I cannot share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for your son - he is alive and well.
Reading Joe Dispenza, he is conducting experiments to study the effects of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
Journalist of the channel "1+1", Nataliya Nagornaya published this morning a video recording that she received from the military of the 36th brigade of marines from Mariupol.
They say in the military that they have no weapons left to take part in battles, and the mountain is full of wounded.
They said that the time is counting.
Prior to that, the 11th April 36th Independent Marine Infantry Brigade, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in the Russian language.
It was said that April 11th could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the soldiers for two weeks.
In social networks, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in the Russian language.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhny, assured that the connection between the command and the forces defending Mariupol should not be a matter of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters from accessing the factory "Azovstal" in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On April 11, Russian invaders dumped an unknown poisonous substance in Mariupol.
Andriy Biletsky, the leader of the Azov Battalion, stated that the Russian military had used chemical weapons against the steel factory "Azovstal", which is being held by members of the Azov Battalion.
Thank you, I will adjust to suit you. It would be great.
The situation remains the same, for now we are here.

Today, their mountain friends, led by the head of the settlement council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasily Shchur, delivered drones for the purpose: they received special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities, where the fighting is taking place.
The purpose of maximally efficient and safe use of drones - their current locations shall remain secret.
Four friends, who are helping the Ukrainian army to stop, say that soon many interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve the destruction of the Russian invader and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I enjoy sweet things, but I can also do without them.
I am worried that we won't make it. We have a lot of baggage.

Thieves stole portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the deceased participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They lowered the flag.
Good morning, thank you children for the holiday, we do not have such a custom, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, it is possible that something else is needed.
If you want to speak Czech, you can talk to whoever you want.
There will be twelve people here, then I will go to work.
Hello a bit better.
Today there was snow.
Even today there is already sleeping.
We have made great progress.
I will definitely bring cookies to the party!
I don't have the strength to do it today.
Since I have to put in extra effort to clean my apartment after having guests, I can roughly say that it will take me until April month because I already have a rough schedule for cleaning my apartment.
I can roughly say at the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just asked what you are talking about..
Hello, sorry, I didn't have time to cook dinner and I took a nap.
If you are not against it, I could come today.
We will meet after your arrival.
He is humble, recently he has been studying a lot. He realized that it is very important to him in life.
Hello, everything went very well.
I was a bit shocked to be working with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with the director of the economics department of the highland region.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well.
I will bring proof of employment and payment for the job on Monday.
I am looking forward to Friday.
I do nothing but drink a lot of them and pee a lot 😂 (and drink a lot of water ☝🏻)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I will have gone with you, if possible.
I will bring another analysis.
You will have to drive again.
The rain gutter is not working properly, it is not draining well. A master needs to be called to fix it.
There is not enough there.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I would like to invite you to attend a Czech language course, which you have signed up for.
Do the children need to be brought along?
You can ask one question now.
If you need help writing, I can help.
If I am not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today.
We did not want people to think we were profiting from this from the start!
I need two more points to complete the online task.
I will be resting. Gathering strength and energy. Thank you for the gift today.
That's a great idea! I'm amazed by the video. It will be great, because the whole family will be painting.
Kazin University encourages workers and students to carefully check any information, not trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, gossip and rumors.
Only rely on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
Gathered several works for portfolio.
After the holidays, we need to use the internet.
I wanted to be your backup designer.
My day off was a vacation.
The Russian Federation is preparing a provocation in Transnistria in order to accuse Ukraine.
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Pridnestrovian region of Moldova, in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.
It is not ruled out by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation provocative actions on the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.
The enemy is continuing to form an offensive military grouping for actions on the Slobodzhansky direction.
It is likely that the attackers will try to resume the attack in the near future.
In addition, the enemy is continuing to prepare and send personnel, weapons, and equipment for participation in combat operations in Ukraine.
The preparation of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the 60th Independent Motorized Infantry Brigade (Monastyrshchyna) of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the mentioned weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also for the restoration of personnel losses of battalion tactical groups from 36th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th General Army of the Eastern Military District is carried out recruitment of military personnel from the specified brigade.
The enemy experiences a difficult problem while assembling drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is planned for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy will continue to strike Ukraine's transport infrastructure in order to disrupt the delivery of supplies to the battlefields and cause destruction or disruption.
The units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus are continuing to perform tasks to strengthen the security of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.
Some units of the 6th General Army and Northern Fleet Coastal Forces are continuing to partially blockade the city of Kharkov, while artillery fire is still targeting certain areas of the city.
Air reconnaissance of the area is ongoing in order to detect the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
The enemy is using the BPA "Orlan-10".
The enemy attempted to advance on the towns of Dovgne and Dmitrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to their previously held positions.
The enemy is continuing to focus their efforts on seizing the towns of Popasna, Rubizhne, Lower and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted to launch an attack in the Gold area, but it was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupying forces are continuing their attack with artillery and air strikes in the areas of the steel factory "Azovstal" and the port.
The enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the settlements of Vysokopilly, Trudolubivka, and Mar’yanske.
In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles of the motorized equipment and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
I don't understand your thoughts?
We usually try to hurry, but I doubt.
You want to sleep but I am holding you back.
I do not want to come.
If you do not want to see me today, just tell me and I will understand.
Thank you. We didn't watch the television and we're even more excited about 1+1. We don't need to configure anything.
I am only turning on the television to listen to the Czech language.
My monthly tariff is about to end.
Can I do it over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, needles for embroidery.
I can prepare material in this area.
I ask her. I'm a bit ashamed to ask her, since she gives us so many pies.
I will definitely meet my father, for sure 🙏🏻
I read the announcement on Facebook, perhaps Google wrote something about it. I think the number of the telephone is enough.
Good day, we brought you some things, but there are some small things that we can bring you in 10 minutes.
I was thinking about work.
If the director schedules it, I can start going to work next week and submit the documents (if possible, since there are long lines) and on Saturday it might rain :)
I am looking for a team to start with, I really enjoyed chemistry in school, I am studying Czech language to perfect my knowledge, I dream of working at T-Mobile.
Friends old and not very many, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends of the spirit and the mind.
You have also arrived at difficult times.
During the last month, I communicated with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy, has turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
Many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame for the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Why do you subject Ukraine to your name.
Some of you, activists, have already been threatened for a long time, and you were preparing for the final blow.
In March I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
Sasha replied typically, laconically: "I'll tell you later, as usual. Now let's go explore the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
Nobody likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, and most people hate them.
Except for a few of you - those who worked in the "Memorial", "New Paper", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", and other places, how many of you did at least something to oppose this regime?
Other than participating in protests, when they still occurred.
Read also the column of Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to speak".
If you are sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
It is possible that you have been called by your indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and passive acceptance, which now, perhaps, weigh heavily on your soul and heart.
It was not always so.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period of time when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy – chaotic, even violent, but real.
However, the 1991 year proved to be worse than the 1917 year.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, you are ultimately overwhelmed by such a strong fear of chaos that you look for salvation behind the throne, whether its name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, it still seems safe around him. Why?
Yes, there were mistakes.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you chose to bury your soul at the Dzerzhinsky Memorial – and allow the KGB to lie low, reform, and seize power in the country.
When you were faced with the choice between robbery and the return of the communists, you meekly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, which marked the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern became survival.
Then appeared Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began leveling Chechnya with the earth, most of you shut your eyes.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of the Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw the ruins of Grozny, Katyr-Yurt, Itum-Kale and other cities with my own eyes.
Sometimes I returned to Moscow and had a great time with my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of peaceful citizens, about children who were killed, about soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
They said to me: "Get lost, your Chechnya is boring". I remember these words very well.
I was furious: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya."
Your country, take it away, not mine.
I am just a stupid foreigner here.
Your government is bombing one of your cities, killing your citizens.
No, it was too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came an economic boom in the middle of the zeros, due to rising prices of oil and Putin's willingness to look the other way as some of the stolen money remained in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-to-do, some have become wealthy, and even the poorest among you have bought new housing and found better jobs.
Prices rose, but what's the big deal?
Moscow shone brightly and sparkled with stars.
When they killed several opposition activists – including Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed fear about what was happening.
However, the matter did not progress further.
When Putin transferred the presidency to Medvedev and then took his own seat as prime minister, you hardly seemed to notice.
When Medvedev was in power, most of you either ignored it or stayed silent.
I met several of you in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the pre-gorges of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, until your army occupied part of this country.
We may have done a lot of things in the West if we did anything at all.
Some anger, some sanctions; but what significance did it have that Russia was violating international law, when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and internal market?
Life in Russia was good.
After the difficult 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidential seat, many of you decided that it was enough, and you all went out to protest.
Navalny's name became infamous, you didn't walk the streets for a half year, and the regime ultimately felt afraid that it was losing ground under its feet.
After he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Someone received immense terms.
What could we have done?
I feel so often and still hear.
The state is so strong, but we are so weak.
Look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they took the Maidan – and never left it.
They had set up a tent village and were preparing for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to demolish it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, iron bars and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
Instead of fleeing, the protesters advanced.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych fled, and the Ukrainians reclaimed democracy, the right to freely choose their leaders and evict them if they are not doing their job properly.
The protest did not please Putin.
That was a bad example.
Using the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it turned out to be beneficial.
How many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of the citizens of Russia supported the annexation.
Where did this new myth suddenly come from, and how many of you, who despised Putin and his gang, have suddenly turned around and started worshipping him?
I find it hard to understand why we stopped talking after that.
Those who remained my friends mostly kept quiet.
You said that politics doesn't interest us.
I was hidden in books, movies, catalogs, get rid of new after restoration, which began the mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their binbags, a public park and hipster cafes.
Yes, Donbas is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful – it only gets better.
We have turned our attention to Syria.
Were there terrorists there, really?
He even criticized my book about Syria, because he said I had no idea what was going on there.
Well, at least I went there and saw with my own eyes how the state snipers cold-bloodedly shot my children's peers on the streets of Khmelnytsky.
Only your soldiers, who began bombing thousands of peaceful citizens in 2015, gained experience for the next serious war.
Many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller: "First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me."
At first they came for the socialists, but I remained silent – I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the union, but I remained silent - I was not a member of the union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent – I am not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.
How many people have spoken to you about the Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you are doing it.
Most of them remained silent.
Someone is speaking now – for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people are allowed to speak from abroad, some from the center of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new GULAG or to join the company of Navalny.
Regarding others, you probably know where you live best.
I am sure you understand: when Putin will settle with the Ukrainians – either, which appears very likely, if it does not work out for him, he will take you.
To all of you, my friends: those who have been brave, but mostly alone in attending protests, has so far been a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
To all of you who signed the petitions, who expressed dissent in social networks (even just by using a black square in Instagram) or who spoke out in private conversations with colleagues.
When 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote, they remained in such a distant past – now they, with a high probability, await you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will remain?
The number of Ukrainians is even more frightening than 2014, according to the Putin regime: they demonstrate that it can be fought.
Intelligence, motivation, and courage can stop him, however strong the paper might be in his favor.
Regardless of how few people in Russia realize it, there is a war going on.
You, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You are reading foreign news online, you have friends or relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain contact.
He knows that you know.
Be prepared.
You understand what is going on.
Life has ended in exchange for your silence.
Your choices are just a joke, your laws, if you don't take into account repressive, cost no more than paper, on which they are written, your last free media no longer exists, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you have no credit cards to buy a ticket to go abroad, even if some flights remain.
Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement and submission.
If you don't give him what he wants, you can try to convince him or just leave.
I am not sure if you will see another version.
However, there is still one left.
Eventually this regime will collapse.
You may need to do less than you think.
Consider this.
A spark will probably not come from you: due to the economic collapse that is approaching Russia, it is likely to flare up in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices rise, but wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, wanting bread and peace, will come out onto the streets.
Putin knows it and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, i.e. you, my friends.
If each city were to hold its own protests, as has happened periodically, it would be easy to suppress them one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd needs to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical instrument – the internet, which can be restricted, but which still works and can be adjusted under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was crushed, but it is possible to create other, less formal, more decentralized ones.
You are many, you are millions.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly with a hundred thousand.
If there are more than 300,000 people, she will be amazed.
It will have to use the army, but will it fight for Putin when the time comes?
After all that he made them go through in Ukraine, what prompted him to do so?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a familiar fear; those who have children will be especially afraid for them.
It is natural, it is normal.
I was also afraid there.
In the example of Syria, now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who defy their master, not just demand freedom, but truly strive to achieve it.
Even if you do nothing, countless lives will be lost needlessly.
Your son will be arrested if he makes a joke in the chat of a computer game; your daughter will be arrested if she expresses anger on the internet; your close friend will be killed if he makes a mistake.
This has been happening for many years, and it will only increase in size and scope.
There is no choice for you. If you do nothing, you know what the outcome will be.
Act coolly, think strategically, and strive to make it a reality.
We were told on Friday that we could come in on Monday.
We will be home in the evening.
You perceive me as a secretary.
How often do you eat dinner in an expensive restaurant?
I went to a fancy restaurant for dinner once.
I will try to explain it to her.
We really liked it a lot and we wanted something better than that.
She was exhausted from all the people in the room.
I feel bad, cough, fever, loss of voice, weakness, and my head is spinning.
I have to go to work.
I did it, but they said I would receive money only at the end of the month.
We need to take a break, let's go with the children to the doctor.
However, at night, a woman wrote to me, saying she liked your work, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I am waiting for new news and I will definitely inform you.
While working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building my career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, intellectual work which I completely failed.
It's too bad to waste time, but it's life experience.
In my personal life I am communicative, but I am serious when it comes to matters of marriage.
He was the man I was supposed to marry, but he died, due to heart problems.
I believe that people must love, respect, and trust each other in order to create a family.
Now, I have not encountered such a thing.
Good day. Where can I buy forms for baking paskas (paper or silicone)?
Thank you for the surprise, I will now include my passport in the application.
She is lying down, her wheelchair is broken, her crutches are lying next to her, and her clothes are shredded in the blender.
Sorry to bother you during your break.
You have an important question.
I went to Nathalie's game room today to say hello.
She found herself in an unpleasant situation.
When the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said she had come to look at things and organize them in that room with clothing and Pavel yesterday opened our children's room until 19:00.
Is that really true?
The working hours of the room are until 4 PM.
Eventually, it is our responsibility.
My internet connection is very weak, so it takes a long time to open a page.
Good day, we are all doing well. Yesterday, we filled the vacancies, and I studied with the elders before the exam in the gymnasium.
It is harder to untangle geometry problems.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
Vika is studying university and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for our home.
Yes, I thought you had filled it.
We will try to collect the maximum sum by the end of the week in order to calculate the total.
The situation regarding the Russian invasion – a briefing by advisor to the President Oleksandr Arestovych (10.04.2022)
The adviser to the president's office told the heroic deed of a senior officer of the naval infantry in Mariupol - he was surrounded and wounded, so he detonated himself with a radio station to prevent it from falling into the enemy's hands.
I have a very important question, can you help me to record my Daughter's 5 years (bronchial asthma) now she has a cough and a sore throat ...
We need a family doctor who understands a bit of Ukrainian or Russian.
I am very worried about her condition.
We live in Czech Republic, Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor who is located here in Dolní Chabry or somewhere nearby, so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was very popular.
Moths were settling on the children's hands and feet.
What is your day like?
Thank you so much! I am so grateful, I don't know what to say. I really enjoyed it❤️
My mother is standing from 4 o'clock.
It is possible to leave your phone for communication.
This appears to be the best option in Prague-8.
The director said nothing about the possibility of sponsorship for the children's meals.
I have given you these data for payment.
I have already paid for part of March and April's food.
If you had the possibility to help me pay for May and June?
What do I need to do?
Turn to the director of the school with these questions?
Do you prefer to go out on weekends or come to work better on Wednesdays?
All your friends will know what you are talking about with me.
I don't know what to do or where to live; I need a place to live soon.
Why did you leave our relationship?
I am from Donetsk region, I have medical education, 27 years of experience, I work in a neurological department, massage, physical therapy for adults and children, I speak Russian and Ukrainian, for the rest of the information call +420-464-548-072 or write to +380-42-791-0436.
I was a master of manipulation 😥, and my friend was the manager.
We can do everything, we are Ukrainians, and what we can't do, we'll learn quickly.
I wish to find a good assistant.
I thought about something today.
Could you please take me with you, as you are going home?
I need a room. I can pay the rent.
I don't know what to do.
We need to periodically go to the embassy, I am waiting until I can redo the documents, I will still be looking here.
I also enjoy talking with you.
