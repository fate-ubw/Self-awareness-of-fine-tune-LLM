I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Why did the artist become famous? Because of television.
Yesterday, I was browsing Netflix for something to watch, but all the staff were laughing in the background, even though it wasn't very funny.
There's nothing amusing about it. It's just ridiculous.
Despite staff members not smiling, the artist's work was of poor quality and tasted awful.
In the past, there were many black-owned businesses in that industry, but now it has become too competitive and the egos of some artists are getting in the way. It's either too expensive or there's nothing to eat.
I can't believe how many people are talking about how difficult it is to be an artist.
It is becoming increasingly difficult to make a living as an artist, but I am determined to reach the pinnacle of my profession.
I can't understand why people are trying to legitimize themselves by gaining attention in the media and society.

Although it is troublesome to buy a personal computer, it is worth considering since it is a famous place.
I discovered that a wireless gaming mouse for MSI for 3,280 yen (including tax) was sold from the previous Tuesday.
Since the price of the wireless version is the same as the price of the wired version, it is possible to consider the possibility of a misprice of 5,071 yen (including tax) if you confirm the price of the wired version.
Normal mail arrived and the next day's shipment mail also arrived.
This email and purchase history of my page contains the name "CLUTCH GM41 Lightweight Wireless".
From the time the order was placed until the shipment arrived, we had no communication or cancellation notifications from the customer, so we assumed the order had been completed at that point.
This problem occurred after a few hours from the shipment, with a difference in product registration. A mail has arrived.
According to that email.
We were selling the wireless version at a discount, but in reality it was the wired version.
There are many wires connected to the mouse so it is already shipped.
We do not accept any refusals.

You can choose either the wireless or the wired version of the product page, and it will be reflected in your purchase history, either by wireless or by wired.

The only bridge out of the area due to the typhoon and heavy rain was featured on the news in Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV).
Mr. Matsumoto from Matsumoto-cho in Fukushima Prefecture.
The major impacts of the 2019 East Japan Typhoon were felt by 8 people in 3 generations.
Mr. Matsumoto: "It was like a magical experience."
The only road leading to the Highland region, the Highland Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Tsunami and 30 people from the area are now in a state of isolation.
The people who have access to strong water are able to carry necessary supplies over the forbidden bridge of JR by using the steel bridge.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "If it's not raining, you can walk to the store. If it's too far, you can carry the bicycle, or if it's too difficult to ride the bicycle, you can walk over the temporary bridge for about three months until the permanent bridge is completed."
Mr. Matsumoto has been continuing to take lessons even two years after the disaster.
Mr. Matsumoto thinks there might be a case.
At least three times as much food as before the disaster, such as canned goods and instant noodles, can be utilized for non-perishable items.
Ms. Matsuko San: "I don't know when disaster will strike me, so I'm stocking up on supplies and hoping for the best. I've experienced the 'unexpected disaster' of a bridge being washed away in Shimabara City."
To never forget the lessons learned in 2021, he started his own unique take on things from that year.
The town of Shimokawa is planning to prepare for the "Shimokawa Disaster Prevention Day" in the form of an annual event from next year onwards, thinking about what kind of measures to take in regards to equipment for disaster prevention.

When buying a used house, beware!
Diamond Online - Yahoo! News
The "Building Condition Survey" system, which was newly established for the activation of the second-hand housing market, is working well for second-hand housing transactions.
The price of both houses and renovations are increasing, and the renovation market is trending upwards.
The popularity of words such as "tower" and "large-scale" is concentrated in newly constructed buildings, leading to a decrease in affordability.
Although existing (old) housing sharing is still low in Japan compared to overseas, it is gradually increasing.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started an inspection of building conditions and safety of so-called "inspection" in 2018, aiming to promote safe and secure transactions of used houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system that includes checking the condition of the building and its surroundings, including deterioration, and presenting the report to the prospective buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that there are benefits for both buyers and sellers when it comes to introducing inspections.
The store owner can avoid the hassle of inventory checks after the sale by providing customers with a sense of security.
It is said that discrimination arises from competing interests.
From the buyer's perspective, it is possible to grasp the condition of the used house to be purchased and to be able to buy it at a reasonable price, making it a great system.
In the system of the current building inspection, the principal responsibility for guidance lies with the seller, who is primarily responsible for the sale.
In addition, it is important to pay attention to the fact that the system of notification is transformed into an obligation.
Translation: It is the duty of the real estate agent to introduce a builder who can carry out building inspections and explain that "it is impossible" or "can not" be implemented. However, the actual implementation is not obligated.
The risk of being exploited in the domestic sex industry is high, but overseas, there are already similar systems in place in active markets such as America and England.
At the front stage of buying and selling, the professionals who are called "inspectors" or "building surveyors" have a system of requesting building inspections.
In the case of America, up to 70-90% of the inspections are conducted by the states.
The main difference between "buyer" and "seller" inspections in Japan is that the "seller" inspection is much more thorough.
The owner will try to sell the building as soon as possible, as high as possible.
The landlord is considering the survey results and thinking about the appropriate modifications that need to be made in order to feel safe and comfortable living there.
Even though both parties have the same goal, misunderstandings are bound to happen.
For Japan's system, there is a risk of being criticized in the following points.
The scope of inspection of the determined sales type is limited to the minimum.
Due to the lack of detailed inspection, there is a risk that important defects may be overlooked. For the inspection company, introducing the customer's case to a third-party mediator (sales agent) is possible.
There is a possibility that unpleasant survey results will not be reported, leading to a "shoddy" inspection.

Is the Silver Building an island?

She walked while admiring the Silver Tower and was suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling of nostalgia.
Is the Ginza district in Tokyo?
The phrase "Silver City" is a metonym for Tokyo's Shinjuku Ginza district.
The "Ginza" referred to in this sentence is the Ginza metalworking shop, which was established in 1612 (Keichō 17) in present-day Tokyo and moved to Edo in that same year.
When it was referred to as "New Town", it was going to be transferred to "Ginza".
At Ginza, "Half Island" emerged from the sea.
Before the Edo Period, the Sumida River used to meander through the area within the Marunouchi district. A half-island called "Edo-jima" extended from the Tokyo Bridge to the Ginza district.
The tip of that island is currently located at the Tokyo Tower.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened a bakufu in Edo and then buried the moat and constructed the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, the town is preparing to develop a port and repair the roads.

Knowledge is the pilgrimage to the sacred site.
The "Ginza Hachiman Shrine" is an annual festival that is held at the Ginza district.

There are rarely any people standing in front of the theater on the right side.
One, "The Dragon King" is on the roof of the Silver Building, "Silver Mountain Treasure" is on the 9th floor of the Silver Building.
The shrines "宝童稲荷神社" and "豊岩稲荷神社" are located in the depths of the forest, but the shrine "豊岩稲荷神社" is known to be venerated by the geisha and samurai of the town. The shrine "成功稲荷神社" located in the entrance of the Meiji Shrine is open to the public, but other than that, it is a non-public shrine.
At most shrines, there are usually Shinto gods and Buddhist deities worshipped together.
In front of a Shinto shrine, foxes are said to bring good fortune in the form of a bountiful crop of five-grained barley if it is constructed.
It is becoming more and more prosperous, just like Kyoto and Edo used to be great cities of commerce, and both Tokyo and Osaka are now bustling with faith and activity.

Korea Post has acquired a majority stake in the Senex gas field in the South China Sea, expanding its overseas gas business. This was reported by Yahoo! News (WoW! Korea).
Senex Energy and Hancock Energy announced on November 12th that they had signed an agreement to invest in both Senex Energy and Hancock Energy.

The pain in my knee, if it is not a "knee deformity", then what is it?
Different Treatment Methods (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editing Department: The pain in my knee is still continuing.
Do you think there is a possibility of getting sick?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can be varied, such as bursitis, ligament tears, and tendinitis.
In addition, many Japanese people suffer from "shape-shifting joint diseases".
The editing department is transforming into something else?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
The surface of the joint is covered with soft tissue, which absorbs the impact and helps to smoothly control the motion of the joint.
It is due to factors such as aging, obesity, and intense sports that cause the joints to become stiff and crooked.
As a result, deformities and burns will be caused.
Editor: Transformation Joint Syndrome can also occur outside of the knee.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, elbow, shoulder, hip, and foot joints, it can also be caused by other parts of the body such as the wrist, ankle, and buttocks.
The most common one is a case of "transformation joint contracture", which is called.
Editing Department: What kind of structure does it have?
Mr. Maruyama said that two bones were fitted together to form a joint.
Then, the part that is facing each other is covered with "joint cartilage", and the surrounding area is covered with "joint capsule" which is a fibrous connective tissue.
Editing Department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
There is a slippery tissue inside the joint capsule which creates the joint fluid.
This joint fluid is composed of lubricants, such as hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate.
In order to make the movement smoothly, it is recommended to use hyaluronic acid or condroitin sulfate.
What kind of symptoms can transformation joint dysfunction cause?
Mr. Maruyama: Cartilage provides flexibility and elasticity, so it takes on the role of connecting bones that do not directly contact each other.
It's like a role in a play.
However, if it is twisted and deformed, it can cause joint deformities, inflammation, and pain.

Experience the thrill of the "KaiJ" series gamble and game 3 (Real Sound).
The popular manga series "KaiJ" focuses on males.
There is an extreme game of life and death involved in this one task.
Seeing is believing! Challenge the iron bridge with your feet!
I want to test the game that is actually being played or practiced in the real world.
The trap-filled Pachinko "Sun" appeared in the gambling hall.
At the original price of 1,400 yen, the item caused a stir.
This "pond" has a large trap set up by the "knights", "movable objects" and a three-tiered "crown" which makes it nearly impossible to bypass.
He lowered the floor of the building with a crane and filled it with vinyl-made water tanks.
The character "Kaji" appeared in the game as a Pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
It is difficult to lower the difficulty of tasks such as "buying a 1000 yen item" but it is possible to enjoy the feeling of accomplishment from achieving a goal.
The "Star-Side Party" event, which was held to celebrate the success of the human-horse race, was an iron-horse crossing.
The knights are competing to reach the top of the tall, thin iron bones that are installed on the ground.
Twelve people can participate, but only two can win the prize, and the safety measures are inadequate and the risk of death is high.
This bridge is very dangerous, but it is also the closest experience to real life that a VR game has to offer. You can try it out at the "Egurubridge" installed at the "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi" in Japan.
The Eiffel Bridge is 20 meters (7 floors equivalent) tall, and a single-arch bridge of "Skybride" and "Victory Bridge" have been prepared to be walked ahead.

In YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru has been challenged to a karate duel by Fujimoto Tatsuya and E-Card, and the topic has been trending.

One step closer to the new year, let's give it our best shot at the shrine of the god of warriors in Yamagata.
Preparations for the New Year are underway at the State Shinto Shrine in Yamagata City, and the annual winter festival featuring a giant paper horse of the zodiac animal "Tora" will be held there next year.
The Tohoku University of Art and Design students visited the shrine on November 11th and participated in a ritual at the shrine.
The shrine is requesting a sketch of a horse from the art students.
Three of the students from the art course taught by Professor Miyamoto have had their works selected from the 9 students who have been drawing Japanese art. Yui Sasaki (22) has had her work employed.
The picture is 3.3 meters wide, and the center height is about 1.8 meters.

Thinking about the idea of continuing to live in the countryside: Proposing a workshop for high school students in the city: "Sunshine News Digital".
What kind of town was in 1930?
The student representatives of the four high schools in Yamato are participating in a workshop to discuss the idea of continuing to live in Yamato.
As part of the survey and policy proposal for the "Yamano SDGs Midzukuri Center" project, young people's voices will be compiled and presented to the mayor.
What is fun?
When a student is asked a question by a faculty member, they will typically answer by responding with phrases such as "I'll try my best" or "I'll do my best" or "I'll see what I can do".
The museum opened its doors for the first time on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed various themes such as "an interesting town", "a livable town" and "a town that makes you feel alive" while moving to different places in the world cafe.
Each thought should be written on a separate piece of paper and organized on a craft paper.
A town with many young people is lively and vibrant. There are always buses and trains available for transportation.
Either we can talk further or not.
The student from Yamato High School 3rd year (18 years old) thought it was impossible to sail the sea, but found the charm of being able to sail the sea with a circle.
The 18-year-old third-year high school student commented, "There are not many shops around, but the traffic is inconvenient, yet the scenery is beautiful. Even adults are talking and it seems like a fascinating place."
The second meeting in December was attended only by high school students, and the contents of the proposals were organized.
The plan is to have the mayor and the education minister make a joint announcement in February.
The president of the center is talking about how to foster a sense of hometown pride among the youth and how young people can become actively involved in their community.

The new way to fold the store (Yahoo! News).
Although you may not be able to keep your store open during the winter, at least you can keep your storefront covered with a roof.
You can adjust the balance by looking into the mirror, but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I thought there was only one store left, I found a new one.
The store of the brand "Cotori" is about one meter long, and has a compact size feeling compared to general stores.
When I first saw it, I wondered if it was possible to make something so small.
You can make a long, thin strip of fabric by folding and attaching one piece of fabric to form a web-like pattern.
Your eyes will be opened to the end of the web.

Light and comfortable with free material.
This year, the popular trend is to wear a vest without a shirt, but it is better to combine it with a hood and a pair of gloves to keep warm.
Carrying this store around is definitely convenient.

The documentary about the Beatles at Disneyland is amazing.
Peter Jackson directed The Lord of the Rings.
I feel like I'm seeing a variety of new and interesting things every day...
From the moment they split up, they have been arguing non-stop, but it's still a dramatic argument.
Putting in a lot of effort despite being exhausted: "It's amazing how much I'm able to understand even though I'm so tired! It's like George is talking to me telepathically, or like I'm in a trance. I can't help but feel like I'm wasting my time though, since I'm not making any progress."
That's so annoying, but I guess it can't be helped. The atmosphere is so stuffy that even the Beatles must have felt that way at some point.
Then, everyone will be able to show their true talents in that atmosphere.

Four people began to make music together, but they weren't sure where to perform. The producer and promoters, who said "Beatles are from all over the world!", encouraged them to spread their own unique sound.
It is unclear whether Peter Jackson is directing the documentary, so it could be that he is feeling something.

In America, a large number of people have been affected by the winter weather and its strong cold. (Weather News - Yahoo! News)
From the 10th day of the local time (Friday) to the 11th day (Saturday), Typhoon Hagibis spread across the American South.
At this time, the strong cold weather from the south has caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, leading to rapid development of disorganized clouds.
The warm air from the Southwest is blowing into the American South, making it increasingly warm and record-breaking.
In Texas, the highest temperature near Houston is expected to be 30°C (86°F) on both Thursday (the 9th) and Friday (the 10th).
A strong cold front brought freezing temperatures as low as -30°C to the area near 5500m altitude, resulting in an active and rapidly developing frontal cloud system along the leading edge.
It appears that dragons are spawning one after another around the perimeter.
The southern part of America is prone to hurricanes, but the risk of major damage increases significantly during the summer months.
The typhoon warning, which was announced on one day in the winter, reached up to 150 times its original size due to its record-breaking intensity.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported 400+ reports of storms and tornadoes in just 10 days.
This means that there are two distinct areas, one on the south side of the line between Kansas and Texas, and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In EF Scale, the strength of the dragon's tail in Kanto is represented by a 6-step scale, with the strongest being EF3, which reached 70m/s shortly after the initial gust.
There is a possibility that the aftershocks of magnitude 4 to 5 will be determined by the survey.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of Teflon Scales) is used in a variety of situations, such as in architecture and engineering.
JEF3, which corresponds to the American tornado, is likely to occur in Japan at a level where wooden houses can be destroyed.

In Kankakee County, Illinois, a Christmas shopping mall was open 24 hours a day and sustained a great deal of damage.
When 110 people were working, the building was destroyed and all traces of it were gone.
In the darkness, the woman felt the weight of the rescuer searching for the missing person beneath the thickness of 1.5 meters. She sensed the rescuer's desperation from the live broadcast from her smartphone.

It is said that the way of thinking about the star rating system is different from the past.
China is arguing that Japan should either add or subtract three stars from its five-star rating system, while Japan is arguing that it should keep its three-star rating system.
There is a two-star difference between the two stars, but the four-star rating is "not bad" and "beautiful" in different meanings.
If there is a tendency for all works to become the best in terms of quality when judged based on five stars, then it is not necessary to present the star rating system on the system. However, since such a system is already in place, it is better to refrain from rating works with only three stars (bad).
Those who advocate for this hand gesture will be silenced by the two-tiered evaluation system of Steam.

As a result of being in a MOD environment, it took about one and a half months to determine the cause of the CTD.
Despite the fact that there is not enough time to play even a single round of GW due to multiple factors such as CTDs arising from various reasons, I was still able to make some progress by taking my time and carefully examining the situation.

At first, we focused on attack and defense related motions/mods in the .dll file, but we ended up with this result.

By 2022, we aim to popularize 6,500 electric vehicles across Japan and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The price of water is 600 yen per kilogram (approximately 577 yen).

The share of renewable energy in the total energy mix is expected to reach 38% (approximately 117 locations) and the price of hydrogen per kilowatt is expected to be similar to the loadmap announcement at the time of 8400 Won.

Although six countries control the majority of the world's water market, in reality, they are the lower-tier countries in the competition.
The order of priority is China, the United States, EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has been steadily widening the gap between itself and the United States.

The first special issue of Weekly Diamond on December 18th, 20
This is a sentence in the Japanese language which translates to "Consecutive Interpretation" in English.
As the debate over the integration of taxes and subsidies continues, there is a possibility that pre-tax subsidies, which is seen as the future of taxation, will be restricted in the upcoming tax reform.
How does the rule of succession change?
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) have agreed to cooperate in order to pass meaningful legislation in the upcoming year. In addition to this, the JCP will teach the DPJ basic tax techniques in order to maximize their donations.
The Diamond Editorial Team: Yukio Miyahara.
From the perspective of consolidating a unified tax system that takes into account both income tax and corporate donations when selecting the optimal timing for asset transfers, it is essential to conduct thorough research and evaluation.
The party's announcement of the 2021 tax reform plan affected not only large corporations but also the middle class.
If we change the rules, it will lead to an increase in both pre- and post-tax profits, so it is beneficial to both companies and the government.
The iron rule of taxation is to reduce the taxable assets that are subject to taxation.
The greatest benefit of the inheritance tax is that it has been widely utilized by companies with a presence in the three metropolitan areas, even though the amount of taxation is relatively small.
In that context, the discussion of "simultaneous taxation and subsidies" was proposed.
The government announced on December 10th, 20
The editors of the magazine asked the Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Investigation Committee and the Vice-Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council to provide a statement.
It is most important to even out the benefits and losses due to asset transfers during the period of time.
Underneath it all, either a problem arises or a simulation is run, and the fastest corrected donation has three chances left.
It is not possible to completely abolish inheritance taxes in the near future, but it is necessary to make drastic cuts in order to reduce the burden on future generations.
What are the differences between sales tax and donation tax rules?

"The Equal Exchange of Efforts" Is the Theme Song of the Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
In the latest manga, "The Edge of Infinity" stands out as being very different from the other stories.
Readers don't seem to enjoy the chapter that focuses on training and smithing, as it is too repetitive.
It has been two years since Monkey D. Luffy left his hometown to pursue the adventure of becoming the King of the Pirates in the popular manga and anime series One Piece. Although he has lost contact with his family and friends, he continues to draw inspiration from the beauty of the world and strives to reach the pinnacle of success.
There is a mysterious charm to exploring unfamiliar places, but it is also nice to come back to familiar places and make improvements.
The translation of this sentence is: "The master of the Demon Slaying Blade, Tōka Mitsurugi, who was entrusted with the task of protecting his own life and the life of his comrades, was ordered to seize the power of slaughter and plunder from others. He was told, "Seize the power of slaughter and plunder from others!"

It is possible to use the power and skills that have been accumulated until now to awaken suddenly and become strong without any help from others.

On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and rental cars collided on National Route 41 in Small City, and 12 people were injured.

The suspect in the village continued to walk despite the broken leg he sustained in the accident, and it was later confirmed that he had lost consciousness immediately after the fire.
However, according to the investigator, the suspect is not suffering from any illness, and it is believed to be due to some carelessness.
The police are searching for the suspect's home and are investigating the current situation in detail.

Yahoo! News Weekly Comic Chapter 4 Review.
The second-to-last episode of the third season of Superhuman Olympics concluded!
Before the climax of the match, the focus shifted to a new challenge!
The English translation for this sentence is:  "Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already begun even before the match starts!"
This manga depicts a one-on-one match between a human and a cyborg, but it's only a prelude to the real match which will be held on the ring.
From the start, there were battles such as capture the flag and special training scenes, but I never gave up. Even if it was difficult, I kept trying.
As the tension of the story builds, the feeling of anticipation becomes more and more palpable. It is reliably calculated that the reader's emotions will be heightened with each passing moment.
The third-place match between Teriyaki and Ramen will decide the fate of the tournament.
Even though I'm going to be fighting as a glamorous person, what I really want is a hamburger before the match! ! !
You are trying to open the top.
However, the terrifying man stopped the knife with his bare hands, and the scene changed suddenly.
This is amazing! There's no way I'm going to retreat, even if it means I won't get the chance to fight a cyborg in the tournament.
Despite the fact that it is so cold, I still have to go out and buy groceries.
If you saw such a future, you wouldn't be able to contain your excitement!
The fact that Karma is going to stand is going to cause me a lot of pain as a manga artist!
Although the fight ended without a winner, the ring was drenched in the tears of the loser after the match.
You must not rely on the strength of the gods alone! ！ ！
That's cool.
This is a powerful statement about the protagonist, even though the reader and antagonist have yet to be revealed. I get the sense that the protagonist will be victorious in the end.
