Hi, I'm sorry, I didn't have the internet and couldn't send it sooner, thank you.
Can you please tell me the exact address for tomorrow's cleaning, the code for the keys, and what time tomorrow's guests leave and new guests move in?
Unfortunately, I have to decline your offer, because in fact I've already found a job.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes it seems to me that because of the translator, my thoughts in Czech are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good afternoon, I accept the course.

If there's no other choice, I'm all for it.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people came out to the rally again, the Russians did not have time to disperse
According to the participants of the event, Kherson had time to hold a rally before the Russian military arrived with equipment to disperse.
"We managed to hold the rally, and now the Russian military has arrived", one of the participants said.
Earlier, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protests in Freedom Square - near the ODA building and the town hall.
This area, as well as the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops, who are using weapons against protesters and kidnapping people.
On April 3, armed Russian occupiers were reported to have used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military use force and weapons against people, are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders are kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson the special title of "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol  the heart of the war, will stop fighting  we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the fighting for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war  and if the Armed Forces suffer defeats there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They are (the defenders of the city  ed.)  people who have attracted a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the OSCE, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these areas, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to the return of even those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for that, too.
Then our negotiating position will be weaker and may not even be of interest to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we have to say.
We believe in our result, in our victory.. ".
Details: Zelensky also said that going to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose opportunities for a diplomatic solution if we have them".
Direct speech: "People will accept peace anyway because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something  and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we don't speak emotionally, the war must end peacefully, or it will end with millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million casualties, it all comes down to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight  but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there's no people".
Good afternoon, do you have any seats left for an adult Czech course from 7:00 on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts became necessary to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of axiological criterion

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, this was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine obtained a list of servicemen of 64 separate motorized rifle brigades who are directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucharest, the report says.
The GUR MOU notes that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable.
The list can be viewed at this link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military have been recorded in liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, reported that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket systems, ballistic missiles, aerial bombs.

Bulob is great, I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the savage mistreatment of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photographs of people being hanged and shot shocked the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
It's exactly what I've been sadly waiting for...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleague with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never doubted for a moment that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the Zhytomyr prison.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU had a copy of the shooting case of my great-grandfather: the whole case is over a hundred pages, and the death sentence is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
Ethnic Polish, Catholic, had five children, was of the free people, poor "one-court" nobility, never went to the barracks.
The fact that they lived on farms and had a few cows was enough to condemn the farmer and the caretaker of the young children to death.
The relatives didn't even know where he was buried.
My grandmother said that about a hundred people were taken from the village at that time and all but two who agreed to give false testimony were killed.
In the criminal case, the name of the knocker is Shariah.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I wouldn't be surprised if his cousin was a KGB informant.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree...
The firing squad that ordered the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia such as "Immortal Barracks", which are a good reminder of the events of those years.
So in today's Russia, the descendants of the NKVD have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
Apparently, child pornography files were found on her computer, and she was sent to prison, where she died shortly thereafter.
Even now, the KGB kills anyone who tries to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
The most despicable traits of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th to 19th centuries overlapped with a thousand-year-old Horde tradition.
And then on top of that, they did a brutal genetic experiment, cutting off intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 semi-French film "Chekist", that's what it was.
Zoe, you've seen pictures of me in a bathing suit.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy for a cough?

Everybody's following the Facebook page.
They wanted to tell you how much they enjoyed reading the news.
We also talked about the privileges Roma people have in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them by phone.

The important thing is that the love be genuine and reciprocal.
I don't know what it's like in Europe, but in our country people get married for all sorts of reasons, mostly selfish, mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with that. If I don't love a person, it doesn't work.
Yeah, we took her home and dropped her off right away.
She thanked me so much, she cried.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it's possible it might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it doesn't have to be, only if it is, and I'm very grateful to you, too.
I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions to ask God about why things were happening in my life that were just making me despair.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
It's just that I've decided to leave and you've made the appointment.
That's right, but we don't know the area yet, and we don't know where everything is. We've been looking for a supermarket for an hour today, and we're walking back.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Is your father the only one who can communicate in Russian, or is there someone else in the family?
Can the children come to the Valley and play in the hall?
All right, let's take a chance then.

I'm embarrassed to be out of work.
I just wrote that at school in class
I'm sorry to bother you, I was just so worried.
But that's closer to when they leave the border of Ukraine, so you know for sure that they're coming.
Because that's where everyone's lives are at stake right now.

Don't explain anything, please. Pretend I'm not here.

This is reported by "European truth", writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, a corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as howitzers in a variant on the Boxer BTR for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of over 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full deliveries will not be completed until 2027.
Is that us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we'll find a way to replenish the stash, and we'll get back to you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without a physical, and then when my doctor gets better, I'm going to have a physical. Am I clear?

To me, marriage is a mystery between two people who don't discuss each other with their family or friends.
Husbands and wives make their own decisions in their family, especially without the involvement of relatives.
Can we be together?
It'll be a while before we're close.
Why not try it this way?
I've rented a car for nine people, we'll come with Marianne and your family.

The children spent the entire evening telling their father and all their grandparents how much they enjoyed your stay.
Greetings from the girls! Best wishes for the holidays from usüòâ
Where were we looking?
I hope my son comes out of this meat grinder alive.
Let's go today, we might need something.
How do we get them to open the door?
Is there an improvement in coping with the coronavirus?
Thank you so much for helping people, and if you can, help us find affordable housing.
We're in Slapa now, we've been detained by friends for a while.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I'm a massage therapist looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing close to civilization.
I just had to give it away today!
I didn't know that even the big stores would be closed.
Pigeons are cooked this way: in a pot, dilute the tomato paste with 0.5 liters of water 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - this is brought to a boil.
I put the pigeons in a pot and pour this sauce.

In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can apply for humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Labor Office in the Prague market.

Lydia has already been taken to school, but we're going on Tuesday because of illness. I told the teacher today.
I'm sitting here with my headphones on, listening to music, thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, sweetheart, how about you?
I know this is hard for you.
But the way I look at it, we're together, we're a couple.
I'd say there's a lot of work to be done after the war.
So I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not worried that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know about the housing. üò¢üò¢
I need to take a test for a food manufacturing license. Can I do that at your place?
Please instruct me to prepare the apartment for five guests tomorrow.
Fifth place, I take it, in a room with a TV?
Fold up the couch?
Can we stay with you while Miss Margaret finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
It's not new, it's been used, but it's working, but it's not needed.
Write the address in Czech, let's see on the map where it is from us
I don't know how much there is free space so nothing I can't plan with the furniture wants this week finally look at that apartment and then figure out what kind of furniture I need
Sorry it took me so long to respond, it was a work day, it's hard to adjust
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you look.
There's a cot for the baby and a bathtub, things I found for the first time.

I want to do a haircut called a cap.
Oleg's sick, he's dying and he's coughing.
Except I'll be a little late, like, 8:00, if that's all right?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be fine!?
After all, we didn't even talk about it on those field trips!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I keep silent about myself ((for me it's just a peak that can't be reached)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, I had a bad sleep.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Cole and I got off on the wrong foot yesterday.
I'm going to ask Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek) to help me a little bit with the mathematical concepts.
Could I be of some use to them?
If there's a chance, I'd like to do some math over the weekend.
The geometry is complicated, but we have to work with Cole to make sure there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the quizzes.
That's what we're hoping for, too.
And so she's very happy with any gift.
I'd like to connect my Czech number to the Internet.
Yesterday at the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we've agreed to be friends.
And last night I was thanking God for this girl, because she's the first person from Ukraine that my heart felt reciprocated.
The branch office in Hall 29 is dedicated to the submission and processing of aid applications
Turns out I ordered a spare card.
It's not worth it. I'm a simple man.
I didn't want her to worry that no one was coming.
I didn't go. Yes, I made it myself. I can do that! The important thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're going out of town for a while?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of addressing three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
It is this foundation that we must protect - it is also part of our responsibility in relation to our history".
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes", he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The fight must go on".
Today, Russia has invaded a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the inhabitants of its besieged cities and letting them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing this on the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that were unimaginable not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never Again!" means more than speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight
We agree, arrange a tour, and write when to be collected
Everyone got sick except Lydia, who didn't. They had Omicron, a new strain of Covid.
Then I'll do it tomorrow
This is a card I use instead of a penalty.
Apologies for the delay in the paperwork.
The ticket cost me 2,000 guineas to the conductor
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of opponents of NATO began to decline, while supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the outbreak of full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens  over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in war conditions, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and member countries  for the late delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspiration for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the "Damn Questions" podcast, together with the editor of European Truth, we talk about exactly how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for and what the Alliance is criticized for, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is going on here?
I have in the vault a partner marked that my application is under consideration.
I submitted it through this mobile app.
There are no visas, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was done in Poland, they didn't give visas, they gave a handkerchief.
We will definitely write to you!
Dennis left in a good mood today.
He arranged to meet the Ukrainian boy he met yesterday outside the school so that he could show him around.
So I hope he's all right.
'Cause I don't like it, I'm not good enough for long
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine
I go, I leave the kids alone, I wait there for three or four hours, and then I go home because I can't leave anymore.
And take it with you for six or seven hours in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had genuine feelings for this man, but he acted inappropriately, and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I turned him down.
Then, after a while, he called to say that he had had heart surgery.
I just wanted to talk to him. I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six months.
During that time, we talked a lot.
At the same time, I began to have problems at work.
His support also helped me during that time.
This is mutual aid.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at it in a different way.
And he asked me to marry him, and he died two days later.
So God himself determined our destiny.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place, and I'm very happy about it ‚ò∫ I now have a place to live and a place to be with the baby.
Did you have to remind me earlier?
After all, I was helping to care for the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write down the sentences I didn't understand.
I myself understand that the translator does not always translate the text correctly

That time at the ice cream shop, I bought two packs and my mom bought two packs.
That's very nice of you, thank you.
You cheered me up.
Okay, talk about something else, because I'm not sleeping, I'm falling asleep and I'm dreaming about bombs...
God is never late, and there is a time and a place for everything.
I don't think he wants to rob me.
I understand very well the cost of unskilled labor and I understand that the kind of job I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I earned at home I won't get here now either.
But I can't just sit there and do nothing, because then all the bad thoughts will come into my head, so I have to do something physical.
At the airport, the paperwork is processed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., at other times you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4 a.m.
So we took them in.
We slept with Vika in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my work and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write and find out what's next...
I can't find my place anymore.
Sir, please, these are the invitations of the Ukrainian children who will enter the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I make it difficult.
Okay, text me when you're ready üòò
With work, I don't know yet. I'd like to, of course, if I can get my kids into kindergarten and school.

I'm sorry. I really don't have any missed calls from inside. I'm sorry, can we reschedule?
I'm offering a job, cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing three windows, dusting.
It's about three or four hours of work, 800 a one-time, from 7:04 p.m. on Tuesday, from 2:00 p.m.

Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
My cat started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I want to ask your advice.

Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please üôèüèª
Are classes different on Mondays and Wednesdays?
Thank you so much for everything you've done for our family.
You need a permit to be in the pool.
But that's my opinion.
My uncle gave her roller skates and a skateboard from home, and she used to skate on them at home, so this has
I'm up at 9:00 too, and I'm just making breakfast.
I'm really embarrassed that you're hanging out with me on your day off.

We're now supplying medical oxygen to every hospital in the country.
And I forgot to tell you there's a snack for tomorrow.
One of the moms said that she was going to get the kids some jelly doughnuts.
He's coming to see you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate cleaning schedule for the apartments a month in advance, at least for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule at all.)
Russian military threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv, saying "this has never been done before"
Konashenkov spoke directly: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such incidents continue, the Russian armed forces will launch strikes on decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army has previously refrained from doing".
The Russians have been launching missile strikes on Kiev since the first days of the Russian occupation forces' full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Pozna≈Ñ.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On 1 March, the Russians broke into a TV tower at Dorozhych near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, debris from a downed missile of the occupiers destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenievka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vinograd, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On 21 March, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall in Vinograd, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko reiterated on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who had been evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are many mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil rig exploded near Belgorod, Russia, allegedly as a result of an airstrike by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Clearly, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing up a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelensky talks not so much to them as to their constituents and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have been able to do.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elected those politicians to do so.
And these speeches, this subtle blend of power, emotion and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is adamantly against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support the idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, the process is already underway.
I know what you're thinking, and I don't want to be seen as a fraud.

This loan is handled by a financial advisor.
So it's going to take a couple of days.

Super then my husband will pick me up because today he has a car from the construction company where he works
We are so happy and grateful to have our Nick and grandchildren under your protection!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One needs to be cut into four pieces.

In fact, all I'm asking for today is your attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I'm going to ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan your shopping, your vacations.
You have dreams.
You're going to buy that dress that you saw at the mall yesterday.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't take that.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You call your office to find out if you have to go to work today.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... but it's not for long.
Now... negotiate... something is going to happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. It's all we spent at home.
A lot of our bosses didn't get paid for the work we did.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How should I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from home... you drove 1,000 miles.
You don't know if you'll have enough to feed them tomorrow.
Every day, from morning till night, you drag children all over Prague.
What's next? I don't know. How much? I don't know. The kids ask for candy. You can't. It's expensive for you.
And out of every iron, we don't have one.
We have a choice. We can stay there and put our children in danger, or we can try to save ourselves here.

We owe you a great debt... thank you!
Yes, I understand that very well.
I'm going to download a picture of the business card of the lady I'm teaching English to.

They're clearing out the enemy, searching basements and apartments for Russians.
The whole town's been replaced, and we're going to start the demining process.

These are the tractor drivers who are actually going out into the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to travel in convoys to temporarily occupied territories to bring aid there and to pick up people there.
These are the heroic leaders who fearlessly drive into the war zone, reassure and assist the refugees in the wagons, and at the peace stations, help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into the wagons.
These are the gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are the utility workers who, under bombardment, take out the garbage, repair the water pipes and power lines to provide the people with what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who rescue people 24 hours a day without complaint, and in their spare time, they volunteer to collect medical supplies for the front lines.

My daughter is eight years old, is that an acceptable age?
I'm looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days a week to come to the Czech Republic and hand over the passports for the visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are too many people in the visa center and there is no online queue.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far, it takes a long time to travel by train, it will be difficult for the child.
So I decided to look for an apartment in or near Prague.
No, we're fine with it.

Until then, you put stamps like this and then you matched those stamps to the cars.
Overseas electoral district of Ukraine (OIE of Ukraine)  an electoral district that combines polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and premises on military bases abroad,[note 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are stationed.[1] The role of the district electoral commission for the Overseas electoral district is performed by the Central Election Commission.

Very tasty apples, what kind of apples are these?
The head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak reported that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that the allies are giving us.
Jermak bluntly stated: "They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness, and they seek to 'kill' the arms supply by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the Bukimto destruction of the S-300 missiles delivered by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I'll name one of them.
They can run fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering with weapons from the allies, and it is massively transferred to the Russian army.
I want to warn you right away that these are fakes.
Because a weapon in the hands of a U.S.S.R. soldier only sends the enemy to the afterlife.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a "provocation".
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians being killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are reprehensible", New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done", she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law".
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians were shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the Kiev suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who withdrew from the area after occupying it for several weeks.
Photographs purporting to show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands bound shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on 4 April that there were indications that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Butch.
"What happened in Butchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures", Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be targeted at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez stated that Russian troops could go as far as committing "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished", Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation".
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after these materials appeared leaves no doubt as to who ordered this story", Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also claimed without evidence that the image of Butcha is "another staging of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Butch.
On April 4, Russia's Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an "investigation" into Ukraine's alleged dissemination of "obviously false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Butch.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see their orders carried out", Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for being shot in the back", he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads cut off, I don't understand", he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Butchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service of RFE/RL on April 2 saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilians on the streets of a small town.
In one place alone, a reporter saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
Associated Press reporters have seen the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people  all in civilian  were scattered on the ground near the site, which locals say was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kiev that until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, we have everything, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told, 'There is no Kiev.' " How the vicious occupiers deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is another item on this list, about which there is much less information at the moment - the deportation of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has effectively given to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainska Pravda" tracked down the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" itself is taking place and if there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text insisted on voluntary forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and in contact with their families.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under harsh coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity home, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Josip Zacepinsky.
The family of Oleksandr, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander actually got a job at the Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
Like true sailors, Dennis and Marina packed their troubling suitcases beforehand, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They did not have a car, and the local buses were no longer picking up passengers.
At about noon on February 24, they spotted helicopters bearing the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them broke into the house next door.
The family then went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were holed up in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"About 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the driveway.
They say, "Is anyone there?" I say, "Yes".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned as to whether they had served in the military.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov".
It was Chechen OMON, not even troops, young guys between 25 and 35 years old.
They said: "We used to help the Ukrainians in the war, Sasko Bily (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war  UP), now we have come to help you".
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say there was a big problem with the water.
They broke into the store, took the goods from there under the pretext "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video online of children thanking Kadyrov for the food.
So they were the ones who, after robbing the store, brought the sausage and said, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich".
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a nice cut.
Our kid there says, "You have seven days to give our phones back". They laughed.
And they kept isolating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want the war, they support the Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there".
And for the most part, they weren't fighting, they were shoplifting, looting.
One of the chickens had a Georgian ribbon tied to one leg and a white scotch tape tied to the other, and they called her "the militia".
They came to Ukraine totally unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten in Butchi, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: "What, do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had established detachments  the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to identify their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON came, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30 or 40 pieces of equipment between the houses.
But they came to us and told us that there was no more ZSU, but there was "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" so thousand 100 in Ukraine.
The "Kyiv has already surrendered" narrative has been going on since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian came to us - or a landing officer, or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio  it was about Butch, Hostomel, we thought maybe they gave us the "green corridor".
From the beginning we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You will be taken to Belarus, and then perhaps to Rostov".
We say we don't want to go either way.
To which they replied, "Then spare the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: They forced us into the basement and started shooting from under the house  or "Cities" or mortars.
And then it came back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had direct access to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part did not go, saying that it was for traitors to the homeland  said, "you will be shot there, your organs will be sold".
We were driven through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burns, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were taking the equipment directly to them.
There's a lot of booby traps, buried machinery and soldiers.
At the Komar border crossing in Belarus, we passed through a makeshift checkpoint, and many people had no papers at all because they had been burned.
We were accommodated in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! A missile is firing, and you can see the trail  it was working Iskander over Kiev.
Although the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, the planes are flying, turning over at the border".
But we're in aviation, we're educated, we know what it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the Chonka Sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Venger Vasil Stepanovich, came to him and said: "Here I am, I'm a Khokhl, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are caught.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
As he says, so it shall be".
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The management of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the U.N. delegation (at least that's what they called themselves) were spreading misinformation that men were not allowed to go to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though there was a problem with the documents - our daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, but on Thursday the war started.
The Ukrainian consulate did nothing to help us, and in Minsk the train station said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
I have to say that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
The sanatorium didn't hold you by force.
Our second group of migration representatives said that you can stay here for a week and a half at the most, because Belarus  is not Europe, there are no benefits here.
We found a domestic carrier that offered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mosyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border  UP), we saw ballistic missile launches over Ukraine: the missile first takes off, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly firing from gun ranges there.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are leaving the army.
One woman told us that she would break something in her son if he was called.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, doesn't believe at all.
They say, "You're lying. We're a peaceful people".
They don't understand that their firing ranges are being used to bomb Ukraine.
In Poland, we were met by friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia there are now probably as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian ones".
Marina lived on the territory of the military town in Hostomel with her brother's family  his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nieces and nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself has not been able to return home and in principle will not be able  the house is no more.
No one really knew about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And you are always welcome!
Thanks for the deal, lovely butterflies.

On 1 April, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the happy news  the Ukrainian military had liberated the city from Russian invaders on 31 March.
The next day the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as at the same time it became known that the Russians had shot at least 280 civilians in Bucha alone.
They were killed in the street, some with their hands tied and shot in the back, some of them minors.
Murdered and with traces of torture were found the village mayor of Motizhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor  in the sewers.
The bodies of several naked women, wrapped in a blanket, were found on the side of a highway 20 km from Kiev.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I leave, there'll be no one at home.
I ordered a package from Germany with DHL.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
"All the equipment, all the equipment they're sending, for some types of equipment, it's too late.
So what, for example, when we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I've seen 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, and that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes", Zelensky said.
Asked if Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied, "Not yet, not yet".
The president also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have been different.
"It would have turned out differently, we would have had the shoulders of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't have been a war after all", he added.
Recall that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military aid, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

Thank you very much for your concern.
We can see each other often
My husband can bring it to your house tomorrow or Saturday, if that's okay with you.
No, he didn't, he was handed over by the chains.
Okay, then we can go to the playground by the river.
If you don't have your family right now, that means you didn't come, which means when you do, it's gonna be 10 times bigger and closer than it should be.

Marina, but really, if you need any help with the town, my husband and I can help.
My girlfriend and I went to hell last night. Try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
I just got a call from a woman in Dameidlo saying that they've been e-mailing me updates on what to do next, and I haven't responded.
She spoke Czech, and that's how I understood her.
But on my e-mail, I don't have a letter from the lady.
I'll need a small flat-panel to pull up the failure on the plate.
Type or types of economic activity
We're looking for a housekeeper for the usual housekeeping here in the village.
The offer is 150 crowns an hour.
Different collaboration according to pleasure.
The date will be agreed between you and the lady.
Of course, but I'm confusing you.
Men also have many nuances
He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had a different outlook on life.
He was a very wealthy man, and after a while he called and said that he had had heart surgery.
Asked me to just talk to him and be supportive, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and he thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car parked in my backyard that looked like a crocodile, and it was making noise.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
What about the housing that you dumped?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already refuted this fake.
I'll watch the last two videos when the Internet is working properly.
Is there a dress code at work or not, or can I wear what I have?
Okay, he's gonna come over there and take them.
I'm not greedy for everything.
I know I can't sit here. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian TV at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential propaganda channel, it's not interesting to me at all.
What happened at the bus stop with the man that the police and the ambulance came for?
Diane didn't answer me, and you didn't answer her.
All right, well, I just need to print out the drawings for the kids, so it'll be fine.
But you may need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm concerned that you'll be pleased with my work.
By the way, I know a girl who's Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic, majoring in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids quietly and the grandmother.
I want you to be with me, to wake up next to you.
It's hard to live in a foreign country, and it makes you want to go home every day.

"I tell her that the'repair of the TV and radio' has been delayed because of imported parts, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to bother when calling".
"We've been hiding information about the war from my mother-in-law for a month.
So far, it seems to be working.
However, in Spots (cat  UP) the fur on the pelvis and hind legs has been shed  this may be from stress, changes in diet and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are gone, but the stress is out of my hands, unfortunately.
The daughter-in-law, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deafened and can hear both sirens and explosions".
Because Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law has been living in the apartment with her "incognito" for months.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, like a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
The war was concealed from her, and the fact that I was near  formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver - she listened for four hours, then sang for two hours".
The radio was always by the bed.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
Feels bad  it allowed me to be unnoticeable to her.
If I heard her "walk", I would hide in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone she was in contact with, six or seven people.
Asked to talk to her about anything but the war.
I'll ask my friend, she's been there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17th - I have two apartments to clean.
Good evening, I hadn't thought of that before.
Hey, if you need any more help tomorrow, we'll be able to make it.
Is it mandatory to order lunch, can I take lunch from home? Do these documents need to be printed, or will they be printed on the spot and I will sign?
I'm offering haircuts for men, women, and children to anyone who's interested.
I understand you and I'm not complaining, but in my situation I'll be looking here for a while.
I'm telling you, there are only so many embassies here.
A British man who defended Mariupol in the Armed Forces says he's ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British serviceman of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Eidyn Aislin, a Briton who has served in the RAF since 2018, BBC with reference to family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Aislin who spoke to him
Eyslin's tweet: "We received a message from him: 'It's been 48 days, we have tried everything possible to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We're out of food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon".
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Brigade of the U.S. Marine Corps, participating in the Mariupol defense operation.
BBC reporters contacted the mother of the serviceman, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that a phone call from her son indicated that they planned to surrender.
A friend of the soldier, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in a recent phone call, Aisling had told them of their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units so as not to fall without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrov" gangs.
An audio recording of an alleged phone conversation between Eislin and an American friend of hers, who is planning to travel to Ukraine, was also shared on social media.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they were unsuccessful.
Earlier, the Briton said that he was threatened on Instagram by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Aisling was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but between 2015 and 2017 he went to fight against the so-called "Islamic State" terrorists in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aislin was known to his friends and family as Johnny, and on social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know this is hard for you, but I also want to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...

One brother to the war in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizhzhya and the man was transferred today from Kiev to Kharkiv.
They call every day, they say everything's fine, but whoever knows him, they won't tell the truth.
I wanted to come over, but I had some business to take care of.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you get home, please write to me, I need to communicate with Daniel.

I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I'm not afraid of work, because I also lived in the countryside, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition of yours. We do it at Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada passed Bill 7176, which is titled "On the implementation of monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the sphere of economy".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We're aware of a lot of new threats to state-owned companies, but we don't know of a single company that's had to physically hold a board meeting at a location.
The potential threat from such a law is understandable  it is an excellent basis for "taking away" all the assets in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then installing manual management.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have boards of directors, and who should be on them?
Moreover  if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill "flies away", then tomorrow others can fly away  for example, you can destroy the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative has been around since before the war and Bill 7176.
As early as February 22, this provision was included in the comparative table of Bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to dissolve supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some elected officials for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, let's examine the arguments that explained the necessity of its adoption.
And then we'll present our proposals on how to solve the issue of state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which can paralyze the work of the company.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will it be able to prevent the relocation of the members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation where the independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire staff) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, according to the bill, they can be dismissed.
Furthermore, it is likely to result in the loss of the quorum necessary for the Supervisory Board to take any decision.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board quickly, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which takes an average of 3-4 months.
So the solution proposed by Bill 7176 is unlikely to prevent the board of supervisors from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmytro Nataluha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes that "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (DIC), are now in need of relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna via Zoom".
For starters, there are hardly any state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board is in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties on a non-voluntary basis.
All power in "Ukroboronami" belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate one or another enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument fails to stand up to criticism because Bill 7176 does not make any changes at all to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises in the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also makes arguments that can be categorized as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to understand some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the first word 'war' leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from the war".
Firstly, this is a manipulation  most of these supervisory board members have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically come here.
To say that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Second, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
It's a tool that's been around for a long time in the world, and it's used in a wide variety of fields: business, education, medicine, and so on.
It should also be remembered that being a member of the Governing Body is not a full-time job.
Often, these people have other things to do, and electronic means of communication help them to do so.
Third, all of these claims are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro doesn't make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they're not out of the country where their companies are located, either.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war  is just another convenient opportunity.

In the Brovary, Vishgorod and Buchan districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a reinforced curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of the Browar, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been increased!
In these cities and villages, restrictions will be in place from 21:00 on April 2 until 06:00 on April 5".
Details: According to the head of the oblast, it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot at this time.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to seek shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to clean up the consequences of Russian aggression  to clean up and demine the territories.
Omelyanuk urged people who have left these areas so far to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
No, the school hasn't sent me anything yet. I just have a receipt for the payment.

The Serbian defense budget grew exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing the army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the world's most powerful military powers.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took seriously the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Lukashenko's regime forces detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28 who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation under Osipovich, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Sources: "Radio Svoboda", the human rights center "Viasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BELTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the support of special forces of the "SOBR", one was wounded.
According to Vyshya, when the men were detained, they actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were treated at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakhevich said that "the acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by the security forces with the use of weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the BZR and the administrator of the thematic resources of the BZR in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Valentin Samasyuk.
His current whereabouts and condition are unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The BYpol formation, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus as part of the "Victory" plan.
The Belarusian "Rake partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring to fight, in Ukraine live force and equipment.

US bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States along with the G7 and the EU are imposing new sanctions against Russian President Putin's daughters, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investment in Russia.
That's according to a post on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest government-owned financial institution, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions would freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and bar U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will impose a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This move is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector outlet includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law and consulting firms", the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new US sanctions were restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in a critical sector.
It will prohibit U.S. citizens from conducting transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets under U.S. jurisdiction.
The detailed list will be made public by the Ministry of Finance the next day on Thursday.
And the final part of the package is a complete asset freeze on Putin's adult children, Foreign Minister Lavrov's wife and daughter, as well as members of Russia's Security Council, including former Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they have in the United States.

I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you a message from Mariupol for your son, alive and well.
I suggest you read Joe Dispens, he's a scientist who studies the effects of external factors on the formation of new neuronal connections.
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was given to her by the military 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the soldiers say that they have no weapons left to take part in the fighting, and a mountain of wounded.
They said, "It's on the hour".
Prior to this, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not communicate with the fighters for two weeks.
On social media, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the communication of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol exists, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to blockade Ukrainian fighters in the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons on the plant "Azovstal", which is held by the fighters of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I'll adjust to you.
The situation is the same as long as we stay here

It's not a big deal.
She's forgotten what she's doing here.
A squadron of Czech drones began flying over Ukraine today.
Nearly 50 professional helicopters will be used for detection, and some of them will be used for direct destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenka.
Today, their Intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones to their destinations: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in various cities where the fighting is currently taking place.
In order to maximize the effectiveness and safety of the use of copters, their locations will be kept secret for the time being.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, it's okay. I like sweet, but I can live without it.
I'm worried we won't make it in time.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, to continue working.
All right, if it's all right with you, I'll do it.
I'll try it myself, but if there are any problems I'll write to you, if that's okay?
The key is to understand each other.
We were personally at the village headmistress in Yiwu, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Maybe it'll cheer her up and make her feel better.
My phone was repaired today.

It was cooler and rainier here today. It should be warm tomorrow.
But it's not the houses that are destroyed, it's the people that are abused by the occupiers.
In Kherson, the occupiers desecrated the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is reported that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with pictures of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore down the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you children for Christmas, we do not have this custom so we did not know if the children only gave chocolate and biscuits, maybe something else should have been given
There's someone in Czech to talk to if you need to.
Because I live in a kind of hostel until twelve there will be people, and then go to work
Hey, that's a little better.
I've already been to the nurseries today.
I've already slept there today.
So we're already making great, great progress.
I'll definitely bring the dumplings to the others at the same time!
I don't have the strength to do them today.
Since I'm pushing back from the days and times when there's a job to clean the apartments after the guests, I can roughly say the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments.
For the month of May - I can say roughly the end of April or the beginning of May.
I was just wondering if you had anything to say about that.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't been in touch for so long. I was cooking dinner and getting some sleep.
If you still don't mind, can I come over today?)
Or we'll see you when you get here.

That's all there is to it.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you have enrolled in.
And do they feed the children there, or do we have to bring them with us?
Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I have a question for you.
If you need any more help, please write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, aren't you?
We didn't want you to raise money in the first place, so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But two things were missing from my online application:
I'm going to lie down and rest, to regain my strength and energy, thank you for today's gift, good night.

Headquarters summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine "of aggression against a neighboring state".
Research: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation may carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state".
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for action on the Slobozhansky direction.
It is likely that in the coming days, the occupiers will try to renew the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Arms and military equipment are being prepared at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to recover the losses of the personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th General Army of the Eastern Military District, recruitment of servicemen from the said brigade is carried out.
The enemy faces a particular problem in equipping the positions of drivers and driver-mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of fighting, will continue to strike at the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
Designated units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks on strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th General Army and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain districts of the city continues.
In the Izumsky direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With the strength of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenyke and Dmitrivka, was unsuccessful and withdrew to the previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the main efforts of the enemy continue to focus on taking under control the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhny and Novobahmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the area of Zolote, without success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue the assault in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopilya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine have repelled four enemy attacks in the past 24 hours, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Did I misunderstand you?
We'll try to make it, of course, but I doubt it.
How can you? You want to sleep and I'm holding you back.
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today. Tell me, I'll understand.
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set it up.
I'm turning on the TV here just to listen to the Czech language.

Friends old and new, friends I've never met in person, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you're having a hard time, too.
Over the last month, I've talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has been turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feeling guilt and shame about your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what they're doing to Ukraine in your name.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, a very old friend of mine at the Memorial.
"I'll tell you about it later", Sasha said succinctly, "as usual". "Now, after the search, we're walking through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are stunned by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduza, at Navalny's organization and in a number of other places - did many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for attending rallies when they were still happening.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt aren't just an abstraction?
Could they be caused by your long-standing indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which must now have weighed heavily on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period where you had a certain amount of freedom and democracy -- chaotic, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek refuge behind the Tsar, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he's killed, you still think you're safer with him.
True, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and releasing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans of the Stasi did, you took a soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform itself and take control of the country.
When you were faced with the choice between looting the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option  and humbly accepted the looting.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass demonstrations for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
And then there was Putin, young, enterprising, aggressive, promising to crack down on terrorism and rebuild the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for him or chose not to vote at all.
When he started razing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw firsthand the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kaly, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I'd go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the children killed, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Brad, we've had enough of your Chechnya". I remember those words very well.
In response, I was outraged: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your goddamn country, not mine.
I'm just a foolish foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens".
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know.
Then came the economic rise of the middle zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-paid, some of you have become rich, and even the poorest of you have found new homes and better jobs.
Prices have gone up, but is that a problem?
Moscow was solemnly shining and glittering with elegance.
When several opposition activists were killed - Yuri Shketochkin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
But that was the end of it.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev and became Prime Minister, I can see that you barely noticed.
When, after a few months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the ensuing years on the slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West have hardly done much, if anything.
A little bit of outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia was blatantly violating international law, when so great was the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard '90s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out in protest en masse.
Navalny's name became a byword, you didn't leave the streets for six months, and the regime finally felt, in horror, that it was losing ground.
Then he struck back.
First alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some got huge deadlines.
"What could we have done?"
I've heard it so many times, and I still do.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak".
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European hopes, they captured Maidan once and never left it again.
They set up a tent city on their own and prepared for a determined defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they defended themselves with sticks, reinforcements, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych went on the run, and the Ukrainians got their democracy back, the right to choose their own leaders and kick them out if they don't do their job well.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he seized Crimea.
Some of you objected, but to no avail.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to worship him.
It's hard for me to pinpoint the reason, since we stopped communicating right after that.
The rest of my remaining friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics", you said.
And you're newly hidden in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, brand new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow started in 2012,  with their binges, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
It's true, the Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful  and getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, weren't there?
ISIS or whatever -- even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I literally didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I've been there, and I've seen government snipers in the streets of Homs shoot my children's peers in cold blood.
Of all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers were there, who in 2015 started bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"First they came for the socialists, but I spoke because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I spoke up because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I spoke  because I'm not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to speak for me".
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have.
But the overwhelming majority did.
Some actually speak now  as, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some  from inside the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking entering a new Gulag or forming a company with Navalny.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin gets through with the Ukrainians -- or, which seems very likely, if he doesn't -- he'll come after you.
To all of you, my friends: to those who have bravely, but for the most part alone, taken to the streets to protest, and have so far done so with little time, but will soon get more serious.
For the thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have voiced your disagreement on social media (even if it's just a black square on Instagram), or who have spoken out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were just a joke are now in the not-so-distant past  and they are now, quite possibly, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians  even more than in 2014,  scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how overwhelming his advantage on paper.
After all, few in Russia realize this, or that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, are well aware of what's going on.
You read foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be ready.
You see where this is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a joke, your laws, not counting the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they're written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try and leave, or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there's still one left.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And perhaps, under the circumstances, it will take less of you than you think.
Think about that.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse that is coming to Russia, it will most likely be ignited in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city marches on its own, as it has done from time to time, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them individually.
It's going to take organization, it's going to take coordination, it's going to take turning the crowd into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool -- the Internet -- which the regime can restrict, but which still works, and which can be adjusted for almost any circumstance.
Navalny's organization has been defeated, but it is possible to create others, more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, maybe 100,000.
If it's more than 300,000, she'll be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will that army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he's put them through in the Ukraine, everything he's put them through?
Of course, the danger would be great.
Many of you will have understandable fears; those of you who have children will fear for them.
