I don't want to watch TV anymore because of that.
Are you saying you can't be a comedian? Television is for comedians.
I watched a lot of Netflix yesterday, but there's a lot of staff laughing and giggling behind the scenes when I say things that aren't particularly funny.
It's obviously not funny, but it's not weird to laugh at everything you say because you're a sold-out entertainer.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be ruined, and it will be unpleasant for the company of the work.
It's like the old black industry, it's like a gym, and some of the entertainers are so full of their egos that they act normally, otherwise they can't eat.
On the other hand, there are a lot of "don't criticize the entertainer" arguments, as the entertainer himself expresses the difficulty of his work.
I know it's going to cost you a lot of money before you can sell it, but it's like being an entertainer, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap, you're at the top of the heap.
This is nothing more than the glorification of one's own career and the justification of comedians for having too high a status in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some really tough parts of the industry that I work in, but I feel like it's becoming more and more impossible for me to touch the world of entertainment.
I'm sorry I complained so much.
I didn't think it was healthy for me to go out like a tramp.

A gift of samples to the buyer.
I was able to replace the items that I had ordered from an online grocery store.
Summary: I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, got a wired version, and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
It's more of a sales problem than a home-built PC problem, but it doesn't make any sense, and since it's a well-known company, I'll let you write it here.
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen at a spider day sale at a spider online shop that had started the previous Friday.
The price was the same as the cable version in the store, so taking into account the possibility of price errors and checking the page of the cable version, I ordered 5,071 yen, considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I got the order e-mail, and the next day I got the shipping e-mail.
These two e-mails and the purchase history on my page said the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS".
Since we didn't receive any error messages or cancellation notices until the order was shipped, I was expecting the wireless mouse I ordered to arrive at this point.
Here's the problem: a few hours after the shipment, I got an email saying, "There's been a registration error".
According to the e-mail,
The radio version was sold at a discounted price, but it was actually a cable version.
We've already shipped the wired mouse.
Denial of receipt and cancellation of all orders.
Number two, just return the mouse and you'll get your money back.
Three, use the wired mouse as it is.
So let's say that we have an equation of the form
They had a separate wired and wireless product page, and they said wireless in their purchase history, in their email, in their delivery note, but they sent wired instead of wired.
Wouldn't it be awful to have something sent to you that's not what you bought, and if you want a refund, you can send it back to us?
If you don't want to take the money back, lend me your wisdom, because I'm willing to fight back.
If you're looking for a job or a partner, don't you want to be with someone who doesn't have a good relationship with your family?
Or is it irrelevant?
And if you're wondering, why is that?
For example, people who have lost touch with their parents or siblings.
It doesn't matter to me.
The problem is that some people, whether parents or siblings, have different personalities and are irrational.

Twice isolated... typhoon and heavy rain spill the only bridge connecting to the district. Residents have tripled their food reserves
Matsumoto Hoshiro from the Takayama District of Yamagata City, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a major impact on the lives of three families of eight.
Hiroyuki Matsumoto: At first, it was like, "Are you serious?"
The only road leading to the district was washed away by a typhoon in eastern Japan, leaving 11 of the district's 30 families isolated.
The residents, who were forced to cut off their water, spent days transporting the necessary supplies using the JR's iron bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass.
Hiro Matsumoto: "You felt the gratitude of the means of transportation, of the car, because normally the car can come to the garden, carrying the car when you get off there or walking on your back over the iron bridge to come here". The emergency bridge, completed less than three months later, was washed away by heavy rains and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
More than two years after the disaster, Matsumoto continues to take measures based on lessons learned.
Hiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
In the meantime, I'm hoping to save two or three days' worth of food". We have about three times as much food as we had before the disaster, including canned food, cupcakes, and emergency food.
Matsumoto Meizōki: "Since you don't know when a disaster will befall you, rather than someone else's business, I felt again that it would be better for you to have some reserves". On the other hand, the town of Yayoi, which experienced the "unexpected disaster" of the bridge being swept away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Director of the Department of Education and Higher Education: "We have decided to designate October 12 as the Day of Prevention of Disasters in the city of Yamagata, and we have also announced that next year we want October 12 to be a day to think about preparation for disaster prevention.
I think we're more aware than ever that the unexpected can happen".

While the coronavirus pandemic has increased home ownership, it may also be influenced by the rising popularity of properties represented by words such as "pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-station, pre-previously pre-previously-previously-previously
However, compared to the rest of the world, the share of existing second-hand housing in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land Transport and Infrastructure (Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure) initiated a survey called inspection aimed at improving the security and safety of second-hand homes.
This is a system in which an architect who is well versed in housing, checks the current state and condition of the building, including the deterioration of the property, and presents it to the buyer after summarizing it in a report.
The Ministry of Commerce explains that the introduction of inspection benefits both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, and can give the buyer a sense of security.
It can even lead to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that can be understood and convinced to buy the condition of the second-hand house to be purchased, and argues that it is a system with great benefits at first glance.
However, in the current system, the seller is the one who has the primary authority to investigate the condition of the building.
In addition, I would like to note that only the notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of the mediation is obliged to explain, "In the case of the mediation of the property, we can recommend an architect who will assess the condition of the building", or "We can't", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, if we look abroad, in the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, where the secondary market is active, similar systems are already in place.
In the pre-sale phase of a home, the buyer asks a professional called an inspector or a building surveyor to inspect the building.
For example, in the United States, 70 to 90 percent of second-hand home sales are inspected, depending on the state.
Moreover, in that the "buyer" leads the inspection, the "seller" main Japanese inspection and its nature are very different.
The seller tries to sell the building as quickly and as high as possible, showing it to be in good condition.
The buyer, on the other hand, wants to study the investigation, make the appropriate repairs and live comfortably.
Even if it's the same inspection, there's been a misunderstanding of both sides' intentions.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as a risk of concern for the Japanese system:
● The scope of the vendor-led inspection set by the country will be kept to a minimum.
For the inspection company, the intermediary (the seller) who presents the case is also the customer.
Therefore, it is possible that inspections may be conducted "frequently" without reporting findings that are unfavorable to the seller.

Gentoo was an island?
You can talk while wearing a silver bra. [LEON.JP] - Yahoo! News
"This was once a peninsula.
And to prove it, you can't even show off a little trivia if you're a Genghis.
I'm going to share with you some of the things I know about Genghis that I think you'll find interesting and want to share with someone.
We're going to the top of the Silver Throne!
First dive into the golden sign.
As you walk around Gentoo, you'll find bizarre place names, mysterious monuments, numerous businesses, and the shadows of Gentoo's history all around you.
I'm walking with her on the Ginza, and suddenly there's a silence, and I'm like, "Oh, this used to be a peninsula.
Gentoo was once a peninsula?
The name of the street that gave birth to the "Ginzo" in various parts of Japan, and the "Ginzo" in Tokyo's downtown area.
Originally, the term "Ginza" referred to a silver coin foundry. In 1612, the Ginza office, which was located in the present-day city of Shizuoka, was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Exchange Town", but when it was moved to Shell Town, it became known as "Ginzo Town".
By the way, once upon a time, Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Prior to the Edo period, there was a peninsula called "Edo Front Island" stretching from Japan Bridge to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is in present-day Ginza.
When the Tokugawa clan opened the shogunate in Edo, they filled in the inlets and repaired the Jōhō district.
In addition, the family cultivated the pottery to improve the neighborhood and develop the shipping industry.
And they've cleared the mud, they've cleared the mountains, and they've filled in the creeks.
In addition, in front of the Tiffany Ginza headquarters (Ginza 2-7) in the central area, there is a stone monument "Ginza's birthplace" indicating the site of the Ginza office, so why not look for an interesting direction.
"Pilgrimage to the Holy Land" by Genghis Khan, as many of you know.
In Ginza, there is an annual "pilgrimage to the Holy Land" known to everyone as the "Pilgrimage to the Shrine of Ginza".
Of the more than ten shrines, the most visible would be the "Kabuki Shinjuku Shrine" in front of the Kabuki constellation.
The company at the right end of the Kabuki constellation is frequented by many before and after the show.
On the other hand, the "Dragon Light Immovable Lord" is on the roof of the Ginza pine house, and the "Ginza Born Landscape Lord" is on the Ginza terrace on the ninth floor of the Ginza Three-story building.
The Toyoyama Shinto Shrine is located in the back of the street, but it is difficult to see. The Toyoyama Shinto Shrine is known for being venerated by the famous Kabuki artist Hiromu Kanno. The Toyoyama Shinto Shrine is also known for being venerated by the famous Kabuki artist Hiromu Kanno. The Toyoyama Shinto Shrine is located in Ginza Building 1F Entrance. The Toyoyama Shinto Shrine is not open to the public except when it is surrounded by the Toyoyama Shinto Shrine.
Many of the temples are dedicated to the god of lightning, although some are dedicated to the god of thunder.
The rice company, which is greeted by a fox in front of the company building, was founded in order to benefit from the "grain richness" of rice, which is often milled by farmers where there are many farmers.
As a result, large cities such as Kyoto and Edo were said to have the benefits of a flourishing trade, and the faith was spread in Japan's busiest streets, Ginza.

Korea Postco International has acquired Senex Energy in the state of Hubei, expanding its overseas gas field operations.
Posco International announced on December 12 that it has entered into a stock purchase agreement with Senex Energy of Oahu, and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy for the acquisition of Senex Energy.
The acquisition process is expected to be completed in March next year, pending approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders of Senex Energy and the approval of the local corporation.
The acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) since Posco International was merged into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition amounted to 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9%, respectively.
POSCO International explained that the acquisition was made in view of the sustained increase in demand for natural gas in the energy transition period and the division of the market along with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market by natural gas-based blue hydrogen.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will acquire 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's 2019 natural gas consumption, as well as onshore gas field operations personnel in Ho Chi Minh City.

The pain in your knee, or maybe the deformities in your knee?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editors: Lately, I've been having a lot of pain in my knee.
What kind of illnesses are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are many causes of knee pain, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common one among the Japanese is "deformed arthritis".
Editor's note: Does this mean that the joints will deform?
Dr. Maruyama: That is correct.
In fact, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which acts to soften the impact and smooth the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and extreme sports, the cartilage can become thinner and distorted.
The result is deformity and inflammation of the joints.
Editor's note: Does rheumatoid arthritis affect anything other than the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: It is.
In addition to the knees, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers, the ligaments, the neck, the waist, the thumbs of the feet, and the hip joints.
But the most common case is in the knee, and it's called deformed knee arthritis.
Editor's Note: How are joints structured in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: Joints are two bones joined together in a convex shape.
And then, the area where these two are facing each other is covered by the articular cartilage, and the area around the joint is covered by the articular sheath.
Editors: It's a very complicated structure.
Dr. Maruyama: That is correct.
In the inner layer of the joint capsule, there is a tissue called the mucous membrane, which makes the joint fluid.
This joint fluid, which acts as a lubricant, is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfuric acid.
That's why it's said that hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate is better for smooth knee movement.
ED: What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?
The articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and its role is to prevent the bones from colliding directly with each other.
It's kind of like a cushion.
But when this is reduced or distorted, it can deform the joint, cause inflammation and pain.

A selection of 3 games from the Kaigi series that you can experience in real life (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The Kaji series is an explodingly popular men's-centric gambling comic.
One of the great pleasures of this book is the extreme game of life and death.
Just looking at a picture of a squirrel makes my legs go cold trying to cross the Iron Curtain!
So this time I'd like to examine the Kaiji games that we can actually play or that are practiced in project videos.
It's a trap-filled patch called "the swamp" from the book "The Gambler's Guide to Kaigi".
In the original, the price was 4,000 yen per ball, which surprised Kaji.
This "swamp" was infested with "forests of nails", "movable objects", and "three-step clowns", which made it almost impossible to attack.
However, Kaiji used every possible hand and finally set up a vinyl tank on the building and went to the rough task of sinking the ground and tilting it, and he captured it beautifully.
The "swamp" in Kaiji is actually a pachinko game, played by many people.
Of course, there's no "4,000 yen a piece", and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you can still get a taste of what it's like to be a Kaiji.
The "Human Horse Race" is the name given to the "starside party" held by the wealthy for the amusement of their debtors, including Kaiji.
The debtor works to avoid falling on a thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground and competes for speed.
Twelve people can participate, and the top two can win the prize money, but there are only four pieces of steel, and the security measures are inadequate, and the risk of death is quite high.
This steel crossing is dangerous, but it was developed as a VR game and can be experienced very closely at the Eagle Bridge, installed at the Osaka Life Park Palace, the home of Professional Baseball Tōhoku Okazaki Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge has a steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the seventh floor of the building), before which the "Sky Blanco" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared and walked.
Of course, security measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Toru posted a video of herself walking across the Eagle Bridge on her YouTube channel, stating that "Iron Bones Crossing can be experienced in Japan".
E-Cards is a two-player card game called E-Cards.
One emperor card, eight citizens cards, and ten slaves cards are used to divide the game into emperors and slaves.
This game is very well done, the emperor is stronger than the citizens, the citizens are stronger than the slaves, and the slaves are stronger than the emperor.
During the play, Kaiji is pitted against Liigan, with the strict rule that if he loses, he can cut off his own ear.
After realizing that an ear-destroying device such as an earphone attached to his ear was reading his psyche by sensing and transmitting pulse rate and body temperature changes, Kaji cut off his own ears to the extreme and confused and defeated the Liang River by making his body abnormal.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased at Amazon.com.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him competing in E-cards with Fujinori Toriyama, who played Kaiji in the film.
Can you feel the Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's true that when you read a comic, you just want to taste it.
You could try to feel that worldview through the game.
A step into the new year, a gentle boost, a large painting in the Prefectural Protectorate Shrine, a horse and a mountain form newspaper
During the preparations for the new year, a large painted horse appeared at the Prefectural Protectorate Shrine in the city of Yamaguchi.
On the 11th, students of Tōkyō University of Arts and Technology visited the shrine and held a dedication ceremony in front of the shrine.
Since last year, the temple has commissioned the original painting of the painting horse to a student of arts and crafts.
This time, nine artists from the Japanese painting course of the Faculty of Fine Arts, taught by Professor Muro Yongminmin, drew three years of the work of Tōhō Ōshima (衣) さん (ゆい) さん (衣) さん (衣) さん (衣) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん (ゆ) さん) さん (ゆ) さん) さんの作品が採用されました.

Let's think about "I want to continue living in Yuno".
What kind of town will Yuno be in 2030?
A group of representatives from four high schools in Yuno City are working on a workshop to think about "Yuno I want to live on".
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Yuno SDGs Mihikado Center", the young people's living voices are collected and recommended to the mayors.
"When is it fun?"
To the facilitator's questions, the student responds with words like "when I'm having fun with a crowd" or "when I'm playing the drums".
The first meeting was held on November 13 at the Sunrise Hall.
In the World Café approach, 18 high school students and community members discussed the idea of an interesting city, a livable city, a city that feels alive, as they traveled around a themed island.
Each idea was written down on a sticker, pasted on a molds, and organized.
"It's fun to live in a city with a lot of young people". "Ease of living depends on transportation like trains and buses".
We'll talk more about what we have in common.
"I thought Yuno was boring, but it's fascinating to be able to cycle along the beach", said Yuno Commercial High's third-year student.
"There are few shops, traffic is inconvenient, but it is better to be rich in nature", said the third-year student (18), who realized not only the challenges of the region, but also the attraction, by talking with adults.
The second meeting in December was for high school students only, to sort out the content of the proposals.
We're going to invite the mayors and the heads of schools to announce it in February next year.
The director of the center, Tōryūe, says that "in addition to nurturing love for the homeland among high school students, it is an incentive for young people to be involved in urban development".
An earthquake of magnitude 4 and M5.0 occurred in the southern part of the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.

According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter of the earthquake was located in the southern part of the Prefecture of Chiba, at a depth of about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be M5.0.

How to find a new way to wrap a stool ((Industrial Newspaper)) - Yahoo! News
It's an indispensable stool in winter, but don't you ever have a piece of cloth around your neck?
And when you're done, you can look in the mirror and try to balance it, but sometimes you hear people say, "I don't know what's going on".
When I thought I'd find a chair that didn't stick to the cloth and could be rolled up, I found something new.
The stools of the brand "COTTORI" have a length of about 1 meter and a more compact size than the common ones.
When I first saw it, I was like, "How can you make it so short and curly?"
If you look closely, you'll see that it's woven together like a piece of fine, long-cut cloth, and it's all in the shape of a net.
The end of the stool is allowed to pass through the end of the net.
So you can keep it wrapped up without having to connect the ends to each other.
It's very light, very warm.
This year, the jacket without sleeves is popular, but many people will wear it in combination with a stool so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I think it would be helpful to have a stool like this.

The Beatles documentary is coming to Disney Plus, and it's going to be awesome.
It's called Get Buck, and it's directed by Peter Jackson.
It's like the Beatles or something, and it's so fresh.
I'm giggling because we just broke up, but it's not the dramatic giggling I had in mind.
You've got Paul, who's all "I know I'm wrong, but I'm sorry", and George, who's all "but I'm sorry", and John, who's all "I'm sorry", and Apple, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and George, who's all "I'm sorry", and John, who's all "I'm sorry", and Apple, who's all "I'm sorry".
I mean, we didn't hate each other enough to fight like that, but there's a very strong feeling in the air that, "Well, we can't work together anymore", and that's what the Beatles were like, and it's kind of an interesting breakdown of the legend.
And, you know, when you start playing in that atmosphere, everybody's really, really talented.
It's a terrible process, starting with a little phrase and going from, "How about this?" to, "That's the song".
It's amazing, especially the moment when the title Get Buck comes up.
It's amazing how well the songwriting is captured, the way the nasal song is gradually transformed into the lyrics.
I'm sorry to see you go through the writing process like this.
And then, of course, everyone's getting fat, so I'm happy just to watch the performance.
It's only the first of three episodes, but so far, I've been under the impression that maybe the environment was more responsible for the break-up of the band than the Beatles themselves.
It's always fun when the four of us complain about something and start making music, but when it comes to live venues, it's easy to see that the producers and the publicists are like, "Oh, the Beatles are the best band in the world!" and they're like, "Oh, they're out of control".
Well, there's a director's interpretation of the documentary, and maybe that's how Peter Jackson felt, but...
And Paul's in custody, so I thought maybe that's why he's the bad guy in so many scenes.

Tornadoes in the U.S. have caused widespread damage due to unseasonal heat and extreme cold.
A series of tornadoes struck the southern United States between Friday night 10 and Saturday night 11 local time.
During this period, the atmospheric conditions became very unstable due to the effects of strong cold winds due to the record warmth, and the cumulative clouds seem to have developed rapidly.
In the southern United States, warm air from the southwest has reached record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday and Friday, 9 and 10 local time, has risen to nearly 30°C.
Because of this record warmth, a strong cold front was formed due to the large temperature difference and the rapid development of cumulative clouds along the front, due to the strong cold winds below -30 ° C in the vicinity of 5500 meters above.
There seems to have been a series of tornadoes in the area.
The southern United States is traditionally a tornado-prone area, but during the high season from early summer through the summer, there are not many cases of significant damage during this time.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day during the winter season, a record number.
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and hurricanes in just 10 days (Friday) of local time.
This shows that there are two concentrated areas, the southern part of the line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern part of the line, which includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado's strength on the EF scale (modified Fujita scale) reached EF3, the third-strongest of the six levels, and was believed to have momentarily been blowing gusty winds of 70 m/s back and forth.
It's possible that future studies will determine that it's an EF4 versus an EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese Revised Fujita Scale) is used based on the Revised Fujita Scale, which is adapted to the situation of Japanese architecture.
The JEF3 equivalent of this American tornado has a good chance of occurring in Japan, at the level that wooden houses collapse.

A live call for help from beneath the "biggest ever" tornado in the U.S.
Regarding the damage caused by tornadoes in the Midwest and South of the United States, US President Biden on the 11th (Japanese time on the 12th) said that "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States".
CNN and others reported.
Biden emphasized that "we will do everything as a federal government".
"We don't yet know the full extent of the damage or how many lives were lost", he explained.
More than 100 people are feared dead.
More than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, between 10 p.m. and 11 a.m.
Although there is a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) of tornado damage in 1925, which damaged the state of Missouri and others, CNN meteorologists estimated that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) and the largest.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was the hardest hit, a candle factory was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas trade war.
The building, which employed 110 people at the time, was destroyed and no trace of it remains.
In the darkness, trapped under a 15-foot-thick ledge, a woman felt the weight of rescuers searching the ledge and called for help via Facebook Live on her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of women calling for help, the live broadcast also featured screams and another woman singing "Happy Birthday to You" in tears, presumably to allay fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, was safe in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son because of a tornado warning.
"It sounded to many like the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying earthquake, like something exploding", he recalled.
A Mayfield police officer said: "The search will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know if it's going to be weeks, months, years".
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead after part of an Amazon warehouse collapsed.
Trains have been blocked due to the impact of the derailment, and highways have been blocked due to the impact of the derailment.

There is an old saying that there are different ways of thinking about the star rating system.
While other countries use five stars as a benchmark, Japan claims to add or subtract three stars as neutral.
At the point of reference, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have a completely different meaning: "there is a minus point element" and "not a masterpiece, but a masterpiece".
I think it's a flaw in the system that doesn't represent the meaning of the stars, because if you use the five stars as a benchmark, "just a flawless work" and "the highest standard of work in everything" will be on the same level, and if there is such a tendency, I think it would be a flaw in the system that does not represent the meaning of the stars, but since that is the system in which it is currently operated, I would say that you should not give three stars.

Hakobune's Seasonal Fish Fry and Sea Frog Fry with Homemade Tartar Sauce Life and Culture Sawakoga newspaper News Sawakoga newspaper LiVE
Lunch: seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry, homemade tartar sauce.
A take-out specialty store "hakobune" specializes in colorful lunches and deli dishes with lots of vegetables.
"So that you can taste the feeling of a restaurant at home", said Mr. Hashimoto and Ms. Yomi, who opened the restaurant in August last year.
One of the most popular menus for lunch is "season fish fry and ebay fry from the nearby sea, homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
The fish choose what is good at the time in the market.
"Fry makes the raw bread dough as thin as possible so that the taste of the material can be seen".

Lunch consists of vegetables, four kinds of deli, and a meal and soup made with wheat grain and rice separated from Hinokikali from Sagawa Prefecture.
Vegetables are handmade in the nearby fields or in direct sales in the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but she has a French education and can add flavor to the dishes, such as rapé and ratatouille.
On the other hand, there is a balance between "eating the familiar soothing taste" like scrambled eggs, and an eclectic mix that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
Lunch: Homemade fried meat and hamburgers (approximately 1,000 yen) are also popular.
Next year, we'll also be launching the "Charcuterie Set", a processed meat that goes well with wine and liquor.

It's fast. It's slow, of course.
Safety: I've slowed down when I'm around people, and in some cases, I've stopped completely, so I think it's safe, but I think it's dangerous in some places.
It's okay to look around, it's okay to feel pain, it's okay to be seen, but it's painful to be seen, to feel like you're in the way.
Overall, it's not bad, but there's still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it would be easier to use if there were a little less people, or if we could get them closer to the edge.
Specifically, I wanted to create a special lane so that it wouldn't get in the way of other pedestrians.
I just thought it would be a good ride if it was a little less crowded, because it's so relaxed, and you can slow down while you're looking at the scenery.
The excitement of a near-future sense of whether this kind of autonomous driving might become mainstream in the future, and the pain of looking around, was a vehicle that was difficult to navigate unless you had a comfortable, fairly patient mind.

A man was killed, a man escaped on a motorcycle, 12 days, murder and attempted murder in a large property of the city of Sagoha, incident, accident, Sagoha newspaper news, Sagoha newspaper LiVE
At about 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was stabbed with a blade by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s and suffered injuries to his face.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and the Saganan Police Department is pursuing the case as an attempted murder.
According to the South Station, a passerby called 110 and said, "We're having a fight".
The man has a wound on his left hip about 10 centimeters long and about a centimeter deep, but he is said to be conscious.
The man who escaped is half-beef and skinhead.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was found near the scene.
The man is said to have been drinking with several acquaintances, and is investigating whether there was any traffic problem between the pedestrian man and the man on the bike.

The family's long journey to establish environmental activism in rural China (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
China, with its vast territory, is also important in terms of biodiversity, the number one mammal species in the world, and the number three plant species in the world.
Some municipalities have recognized the value of biodiversity and have promoted the activities of environmental activists, as well as the protection of the environment by the municipalities.
One such region is Sisappana in Yunnan Province in southwestern China.
Sisapanna is a region bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people, who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
It is the source of the Mekong River, which flows through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Siasapana Autonomous Prefecture covers only about 0.2% of China's land area, but is home to about 25% of wild animal species and 20% of plant species.
This time, Mr. Li, who is an environmental activist in Sisapanna, told us about what he saw and what he was doing there.
It's been 20 years since I started working for the environment with my German husband.
What was the trigger?
Mr. Lee, our environmental protection campaign "Shimon" has been active since 2000.
It was my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany, and he's come to Sisapanna for a joint UN-Chinese science project.
This was the only rainforest region in China that boasted significant biodiversity.
But at the same time, economic development was lagging behind.
That's why, in order to establish industry in the region, to produce the rubber that was lacking in China, there was a massive deforestation of the former rainforest.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
And she met and married me, who was a reporter here.
- Wasn't Mr. Lee interested in conservation before that?
Mr. Lee, I'm from Sisapanna, and I wasn't interested in the importance of the rainforest or the meaning of biodiversity.
So she and her husband went ahead with the project without that knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who don't have a nice face, and they're not particularly tall, but they have an aura, and I wonder why that is.
A popular actor once said,
An aura is not something that's meant to go out.
It's something that comes naturally in a moment of self-confidence.
I'm sure that person has a very strong inner confidence.

It's not thin, is it?
I don't know if I can see it.
I don't think it's that small.
I don't know what that means, because I've never been complimented.
Did he give you a compliment or something?
What would you do if she confessed to you?
"I've confessed to Miss Sakura, my heart is full of spring, here you are, please".
And we'd like to get together, learn more about golf, and share what we love about each other.
If you want to open a LTC account but choose not to open a NISA account now, can you open it later when you want to open it?
It's better to open it at the same time, so that the process can be completed faster.

It's free of charge, so I recommend you open a NISA account at the same time, so you can use it whenever you want.

It took us about a month and a half to identify that this was the cause of CTD in the MOD self-environment.
With stable data until March, there was a multi-factor CTD occurring since GW without much playing time, and it took a very long time to identify as we investigated little by little only in the holiday center.
Why didn't you analyze the logs in.Net Script Framework (you'll understand in a few minutes) because some of the errors in the.dll series and mesh relationships don't remain in the crash logs?
Timing of the main CTD
* All papyri,.Net Script Framework, and.dll plug-ins do not leave a trace in the logs of the type that leaves logs.
* Some NPC kill/attack accumulation time: also triggered by console kill→Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE update and restart version) improved with OFF ※ Is there a possibility of wet clothes for this?
* Kilmove activation camera work time for some NPCs → Kilmove setting OFF by PC. Basic improvement in OFF via ini: Competing settings in relation to DAR+Nemesis? However, the maximum number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000.
* (basic outdoors) Field movement + some magic ((example: ice balloon) firing, NPC hit time: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application settings ((on the right of the MCM) all OFF with five consecutive trials all improvement.
Is this due to an error in the shader configuration of some of the actor/NPC clothing and body mesh? Also, the 2.0 SPID usage default.ini has a typographical error, but as a result it is an intended result and the NPC is supposed to have Perk applied.
In the beginning, we focused on checking the location attacks and OnHit-related motion/combat MODs (such as.dll) by wearing wet suits, but the result was something like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least not at the English, German or French level.
In case anyone in the Japanese-speaking world has a similar CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reminder.
We're doing it with a very tight-lipped mentality.
People around you don't notice it, not your colleagues, not your family.
When you look around you, you can be optimistic that he's working hard and doing well.
But he's probably mentally handicapped, too.
I haven't retired mentally in a big way, but I think it was the limit just before I retired.
I've been thinking about the importance of psychiatric visiting nurses.
I've been a visiting nurse for a long time because I have bipolar disorder, and I think I have a long and very good relationship with the nurse at the visiting nursing station that I'm using now.
Every week, we have a lot of conversations.
And, of course, they do the things that are necessary to manage medication -- packaging, etc. -- but most of all, I wanted to emphasize how important pleasurable communication is for people with mental illness in today's visiting nurse.
Today we're going to talk about gender inequality, and we're going to talk about gender issues, and we're going to talk about gender inequality, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities, and we're going to talk about gender inequalities.
She talks about sexuality between men and women, or how she got divorced, or can I do that as a visiting nurse?
Sometimes I dress up as a woman.
But I've heard from people I know that in visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, the aunt nurses who are unable to work in the ward come and do the paperwork, or the visiting nurses come and the occupational therapist says, "I'm here because I'm doing medical work".
I'm using a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think it's a really good nurse who's going to look out for Frank, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for Frank, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for Frank, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me, who's going to look out for me.
By the way, she's beautiful. (Laughter)
I'm sure some of you are receiving psychiatric care, and some of you are thinking about receiving it.
Visiting nurses are very helpful to people with mental illness.
If the doctor says it's okay, I'll take it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I've had to cancel contracts because I didn't want to.
I'm sorry about that.
I know it's a false alarm, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why is it in English?
There are a number of possible causes.
I don't know what it says in Japanese.

Even with coffee, I can't get very far.
What kind of work do you do?
I'm going to open it up again, and I'm going to go back and forth, and I'm not going to be able to concentrate.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's hydrogen technology patents.
The South Korean government has released its 2019 Hydrogen Economy Roadmap.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be deployed (cumulatively) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated throughout the country.
The target hydrogen price was 6,000 won per kilo.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell cars are only 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the deployment of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure is 38 percent of the target (about 117 stations), and the price of hydrogen per kilometer is 8,400 watts, not much different from the time of the roadmap announcement.
We found that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap implementation is well below the target value.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Economists published a report titled "Current Situation and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States and Japan, among others.
The core material of the fuel cell automobile is carbon fiber, the platinum catalyst is Kyocera, and the membrane membrane is supplied by DuPont, Gore, and 3M.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that lead the world hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
South Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (accumulated between 2014 and 2020).
However, the All-Union reported that "the fact that the top six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market means that they are, in fact, lagging behind their competitors".
The ranking of patents by country is China, the United States, the European Union and Japan.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States to become the world's number one country, widening the gap.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in South Korea was 1,033 and ranked fourth, ahead of Japan (974), which is 22% of China (4721).
The All-Union proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large tax deduction for equipment investment and research and development costs".

U.S. aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine and troops are engaged in training
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials have reported that by the 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine as part of a security assistance program approved by President Biden.
Military aid totals $60 million. At the beginning of the year, the last of the equipment, including four radars that identify the location of mortars and other launchers, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kirby, this aid included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
Military support is aimed at strengthening the national defense capability of Ukraine, which has received military reinforcements from the Russian army in the vicinity of the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. is increasing its alertness to Russian military movements, is consulting with NATO members, and is preparing a response in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved the arms aid on September 1 this year when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forcible annexation of Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula, total aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the U.S. State of Florida deployed troops to Ukraine as part of a multi-national joint training program in support of Ukraine.
According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a matter of operational confidentiality.
President Biden held an online meeting with President Putin of Russia on June 7, which included a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

How the inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes lifetime gifts "forbidden hands", hit the former tax commission chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first feature in the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is, "Family Talk at the beginning of the year!
It's called "pre-mortem gifting and inheritance".
As the debate on the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax continues, it is very likely that in the near future, lifetime gifts, the king of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
With a direct attack on the Democratic Party's former tax commission chairman, Congressman Ganli Ming, he teaches everything from the basics of gifting and inheritance to tax-cutting techniques for timely, profitable kick-off gifts throughout the year.
(Diamond editorial by Hayao Miyazaki)
● To "prohibit" the use of lifetime gifts by property owners to urban corporate employees, "from the point of view of taxing inheritance and gift taxes in a more integrated way, towards the creation of a tax system that is neutral in the choice of the time of transfer of assets".
The ruling party's announcement last year of the 2021 fiscal year tax reform program sent shockwaves through not only the wealthy but also the middle classes.
Because what that means is that by changing the rules of inheritance, by turning "living gifts", the king of inheritance tax measures, into "forbidden hands", we are trying to increase the inheritance tax massively.
The rule of thumb for reducing the tax burden of a highly progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation".
It has been widely used by property owners, including corporate employees who incur a small inheritance tax due to having a home in the Tri-Cities area.
In the midst of this, there was a discussion about the unification of inheritance and gift taxes.
Although the 22nd annual tax reform plan announced on December 10th, which was feared to be introduced as soon as possible, was omitted, the policy towards integration was again set out in more advanced terms, such as "reviewing the current system of taxation of the estate at the time of accrual and the existence of the calendar year gift system". "The non-taxation of gift tax measures will be constantly reviewed from being a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within a limited amount".
In an interview with this editorial, the former chairman of the Taxation Investigation Committee of the Independent People's Party, the former CEO of Ghanli Min, said:
"The most important thing is to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the time of the transfer of property, and to make the tax burden the same every time you go.
Now we're trying to simulate what kind of problems that might cause, and the quickest way to fix that is to give you three chances left in your lifetime.
And even if it doesn't, there's no doubt that in the near future, we're going to take a big step in the direction of eliminating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly do inheritance and gift tax rules change?

How did the players feel about the team that won the NFL championship by passing three touchdown passes in a single game? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones only threw three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest passes in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of the 1974 season.
The 1974 Bills had a late genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in franchise history the previous season.
The Bills overpowered the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
This time, the weather was the main reason why the Patriots launched such an extreme offense.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is not the same as Hokkaido's junction.
And on this day, the temperature was almost 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing 60 feet, and it was snowing before the game.
The Bills were only local, so they didn't change their play much.
Thirty passes and twenty-five runs.
Allen's passes are 15, 30, and 145 yards.
There were no intercepts, and there were no failures.
Four red zone breaches in a ten-offensive series and a touchdown run.
Especially since the end of the third quarter, we've gone into the red zone three times in a row.
Only, in those three tries, I only got three points on one FG.
The defense before the goal in the last half of the game.
The Bills, chasing four points, fouled a penalty at 3rd and 9th to make it 3rd and 14th.
It's 18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd and 14 QB Allen, surrounded by the rush of the Patriots defense, came out of the pocket and flowed right.
And he threw a pass to Te Dawson Knox in the end zone, but it didn't work.
In this play, a right-footed A's WR Stephon Diggs ran a shallow acrostic and was clear of the end zone, but Allen apparently missed it.
4th and 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran out of left field into the end zone, but the pass was intercepted by D.B. Miles Bryant of the Patriots.
Bryant was manning the cover of the Bills' WR Cole Beasley, but was watching Allen's movements on the road, releasing the Beasley and responding to the pass.
Allen, who missed two receivers, threw a pass for the end zone both times.
The fourth-down pass may have been a home run, but the third-down didn't have to be a TD.
You can take the first down in two plays.
There were still two minutes to go, so if we had made it to the fourth and short, it would have given Allen the ability to have a run of his own.

Here's a list of the most profitable regular courses.
It's time to throw out, replace, and keep in the kitchen for as long as possible.
The sponge.
No matter how often it is replaced, it is probably the sponge that is not being replaced as often as is recommended.
From a 2017 study, it is known that kitchen sponges can reproduce a lot of bacteria even if they are sterilized with an electromagnetic wave every day (although it is still advisable to sterilize with a range).
The German researchers who conducted the study recommend that sponges be changed once a week to keep them clean.
It's a board.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture points out that if the slats begin to scratch, scratch, or crack, they should be replaced.
Because once a wound or groove develops, it's harder to keep it clean, and bacteria can proliferate.
If you are still safe, do not forget to disinfect frequently with a tablespoon of a solution of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the flat plate in the liquid for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, let it dry naturally, or use a clean paper towel to cut and dry the water lightly.
Missing or broken utensils.
It may be heartbreaking to get rid of your favorite cup, but the missing surface is a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
It can also cause you to cut your lip for missing parts or spill your drink.
Yeah, it's a chance to buy your new favorite mug!

Community markets and trade are two different things.
The community market uses a steam payment system.
> This feature allows you to make a cash transaction with a red stranger, so you are more likely to be a victim of fraud, such as taking only items without paying money.

FlashBIOS is not over. Help me.
I bought a Ryzen 7 5800X, and I swapped it for a B550 and a tomahawk I bought in September.
Once I went to the BIOS settings screen, I saved the settings, and when I rebooted, the white cursor-like dots on the black screen didn't flash, but remained stuck.
Even if you try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, thinking that the BIOS is corrupted, it's not over at all.
According to MSI's blog, it's supposed to be over in about five minutes, but it won't be over in an hour.
I'm guessing it's because I've been trying to find someone whose USB memory is too old and they're using it to swap SD cards.

So if you're saying it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner, you should just say it's unpleasant.

I used to live abroad, but the Japanese people who went abroad, including me, sometimes thought that the people who came here didn't like the upper and lower Confucian rites, or that they had lost their temper there and that they could say anything to the locals.
If you look like a Westerner, you don't do it out of pure malice, you do it out of a kind of sweetness or carelessness.

Well, we can still be friends.
It's better to say it now, because if you overlook it, you might not be able to stop the exceptional treatment because it's Gaidin.
I was wondering if I could talk to you in Japanese because I'm Japanese.
I don't care, but my white friends who go home always raise their glasses higher than the other seniors when they toast at a cocktail party.
I'm sure you're aware of that, but I think it's a good habit because it doesn't make you look weird to younger people or older people, or it makes you feel like you're being treated like a Japanese.
Because Japanese people, regardless of their personality, have people (including me) who look at such details.

I'm very pleased to meet you.

I have only a limited knowledge of English, so I judge only by the translated text.
I think that the translated text is at a level where I feel a little bit out of sync with the text, but I know what I want to say, and I have no problem playing it. (Just because I feel this way, I think it's better to ask others.)
This level of translation is common in games made overseas, and I feel that it's a good translation for a small company.
I wonder if it is possible for a non-native Japanese speaker to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language even after studying it for a long time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level where the Japanese don't feel different, I think you should look elsewhere.

The battle is the study of the Blade of Doom.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a hymn to humanity.
Among the recent children's cartoons, "The Blade of Doom" is especially peculiar in that "it takes a lot of practice".
It is theorized that there are no battles in general, and that the exercises, which are practiced at dawn and dusk, are not popular with readers.
It can be deduced from the fact that even in the same Jump comic "ONE PIECE", when one side of the grass became detached, he had two years of practice, but drew only touches and the rest was swiftly skipped.
Well, one of the attractions of Wampi is the eccentricity of the terrain through which it travels, although the practice of staying in the same place is not always so consistent.
It can be said that the practice of the main character of "The Blade of Doom" began with the fact that when he begged for the life of Hokuto Toyoda, who had saved his life, he begged for the life of Hokuto Toyoda, who had saved his life: "Do not give the right to take life and death to others!! "
The weak have no rights and no choice but to be subjugated by the strong.
Having said that, the kindness of the volunteer ((who is also a communist subordinate who does not explain his intentions)) is the introduction of the "trainer" 滝左近次, who trains the recruitment candidates of the Ghost Killer Squad.
The first contact between the two is when he is asked, "What will you do when your sister eats people?" and he shouts, "You are slow to judge".
It's a story-telling, seemingly irrational interaction between fans.
Taking your ghostly sister with you carries with it the possibility that there may come a moment when you will have to make such a judgment.
You could say it's an initiation into the practice of mindfulness.
However, an amateur Dōji, who had not yet practised, was taken to a narrow misty mountain and told to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountains are thin with air, full of traps and pitchers and traps, and they die before they enter the practice.
Nevertheless, with his acute sense of smell, he is able to sniff out the faint smell of a crocodile made by human hands, barely avoiding it in any way.
Still, it's not like he's suddenly physically strong enough to avoid all of it all of a sudden, but it's the essence of the ghost that makes the ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly ghostly
Ordinary people don't get stronger all of a sudden, without any support, or they just wake up and use "the strengths and skills they've honed" to their full potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort" that rewards those who have made an effort enough, but rewards nothing for not making an effort, is a human hymn that is different from the ghosts that have unfounded supernatural powers, and it is a hard-to-move rule that is consistent with the novel.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics has launched its new DX division, which integrates home appliances and mobile devices, with an emphasis on user experience.
Following Samsung Electronics' consolidation of the CE and IM divisions as a set division, the name was changed to DX (Device eXperience), and announced on December 12 that it would reflect this in the end-of-year organizational restructuring.
It is intended to enhance the user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has announced the merger of its CE and IM divisions to form the new DX division, which will be comprised of VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Networks.
Samsung Electronics officials explained that "the name change reflects the company's medium-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of its global leadership".
Products such as televisions, home appliances, smartphones, and communication devices emphasize the desire to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect the needs of their customers.
The name also reflected the strategy of creating a company-wide synergy effect and building a differentiated product and service base beyond the boundaries between organizations as a starting point for an integrated leadership system.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to allow users to freely access content and services through the interaction between devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

I don't know.
If you translate "armoured heads" to "disc-shaped heads", you'll lose the part that says, "Armoured heads are giant beasts on an ant's scale".
24 tractor-trailer collisions in Aichi. The driver of the tractor-trailer is not sick.
It was found that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and transported in the accident where 24 cars collided in the city of Koyama, Aichi Prefecture, did not have any illnesses, but was believed to have caused the accident due to some negligence.
On the morning of the 10th, twenty-four trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Koyama City, and twelve people were slightly injured.
The police arrested and interrogated on the morning of the 12th the suspect Nomura Yoshiie (54) who was driving a trailer on suspicion of causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man.
The suspect's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and firefighters confirmed that the suspect lost consciousness shortly after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, the suspect does not have any illness, but some kind of negligence is believed to be the cause.
Police are conducting a house-to-house search to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.

So if a vector is part of a matrix, does that mean that a scalar is part of a vector?
So let's say that we have a 1xn matrix, and let's say that we have a 1xn matrix, and let's say that we have a 1xn matrix, and let's say that we have a 1xn matrix, and let's say that we have a 1xn matrix.
That's why the vector is included in the matrix.
Let's say that the first vector is a scalar.
So let's say that this is a scalar matrix. So let's say that this is a scalar matrix. So let's say that this is a scalar matrix.

The 20th Superhuman Olympiad, which began with volume three, concludes with volume four!
In contrast to the previous volumes, which focused on only one battle from the opening to the semi-finals, this one is full of new tricks!
The superhero pro-race has already begun before the match!
These four volumes are, to put it in a nutshell, a very careful account of the final match between the Meatball Man and Robin Mask, but first of all, I want to emphasize that this is by no means a complete account of the match in the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, the tug-of-war, the training scenes, and so on, you don't really get into the game, but it's never boring.
This feeling of tension in the work, which gradually rises as the battle of the century is about to begin, is sure to lead to an increase in the tension of the reader, who is amazed that even this period is a really calculated performance.
And then, just before the big final, you can't miss the third-place play-off between Terriman and Lermanman.
Aside from the luxury of a battle card, what I love about it is that before the game, Ramenman is backstage, pointing at the Chicken Man poster and saying, "From now on, it's my turn to cheat!"
And he's trying to knock the chops out of him.
But the scene where Terriman, who happens to be passing by, picks up the knife, stops it, looks silently at it, and the scene just falls apart.
What's great about this is that both of them have already been eliminated, and they don't have a chance to fight the meat man in this tournament anymore.
But there's a bit of a fuss about the chicken man.
When you see something like this, you can't help but think about what you're going to do in the distant future!
This is what it's like to stand up, and it's a scene that still pains me as a cartoonist!
The fight between the two ends without much of a fight, but the famous scene is the appeal of Rammemann's tears after the match.
"Don't rely solely on the strength of divine luck!"
It's a saying.
I think that's a great metaphor for the work itself, and I think that in the past, readers have felt very comfortable with the idea that, in the end, it's the protagonist who doesn't lose, who somehow wins, even though it's not his strength.
But by allowing Ramenman to make this remark, Mr. Yuki Takaoka himself has put his hand out of action.
And the reader would say, "Oh, so the meat man can beat Robin with his bare hands?
How did you do that?"
And I think that's what's going to stimulate the imagination, and I think that's what's going to stimulate the imagination, and I think that's what's going to stimulate the imagination, and I think that's going to stimulate the imagination, and I think that's going to stimulate the imagination, and I think that's going to stimulate the imagination, and I think that's going to stimulate the imagination, and I think that's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination, and it's going to stimulate the imagination.

A winter illumination weekend was held in the city of Aoyama, Fukui Prefecture. (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo!News
The first winter illumination has begun in the Harbal Village of Aoyama, Nagasaki, Japan. The garden is enveloped in gentle light.
The winter illumination, which began on November 26, includes a 20-meter-high pine tree and 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along the promenade and lawn.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "It's been a long time since I've been to Fukui and I'm surprised there's a place like this.
She was so beautiful, and she was so relieved".
The illumination, the first of its kind, was designed to heal people while avoiding secrecy. It is lit from 5 to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25.
Also on the 25th of the last day, as a Christmas event, there will be a button pot behavior and a movie screening.
I think only a few people can read the documents in order.
When I asked him if he had a friend who could do a lot of reading, he said, well, he could do it, but he'd learned the basics of Linux bit by bit, and he'd read it from a reference book rather than from a document.
(In fact, it's easier to learn from Linux or something else than from something more abstract like Docker.)
It's kind of hard to understand everything when you're out there.
I wish you could understand.
You don't have to do it one at a time.
And I don't remember what's in it, but I've read it before, so I'll remember it somehow, and I'll read it when I need it.
I began to read little by little, because I could not read anything at all, and I used to read it over and over again in practice.
The child has eczema on his body.

Internet distribution, agricultural products PR, Agricultural Promotion Co-operative, and mountain newspapers from Miyazawa
On the 11th, the Council for the Promotion of Agriculture, which consists of municipalities and JA in the given area, developed PR activities for agricultural products using "live commerce" to sell goods while distributing video on the Internet.
For the first time, the Tokyo metropolitan port district organized the "All Nations with MINATO (All Nations) Market TV" in which the warriors of love participated remotely and conveyed the charm of the region with special products.
A joint initiative between the area and the port district, the "Oidama × Sensei and the Open Port Project", led to the establishment of the outlet. It was broadcast from the Risan Vision House in the new town of Nanjiro, Miyazawa City.
Satsuki Kuroda, who acts as "Richiyama Somrie", introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature around the stools of the Miyazaki textile brand "nitorito".
He also told me about the cooking party with the military commander of love.
In the Tokyo studio, Kawamura Emiko, a comedian, and more than 300,000 registered YouTubers tasted local liquor, wine, Mizuho cattle, and princesses.
When I told the audience about the deliciousness, they commented: "The smell is transmitted by the delivery", "The drink is delicious, lots of delicious things are the best", and so on.

I had a little misfortune this morning.
I've lost the power supply for my NAS PC.
- What happened?
1. In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is in communication.
2.) When you go back to your room after a while, you notice that your computer sounds like a pink rotor, and then it shuts down.
At this point, I thought that the fan movement was only getting worse due to the decrease in room temperature (about 6°C).
So after warming up the room, I decided to try it again.
3. Do not activate.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp flashes for a moment, and the fan moves, but soon stops.
After that, I'm not going to apologize.
I'll pull the plug and try again, but it'll only last a moment.
4.) Connect only ATX20 pins and 4 pins to the motherboard and remove the other parts to try and not start.
5.) In the past, fans of the PSU used to make the sound of bubb bubb bubb bubb as if they were hitting something, so they suspect that the PSU is the cause.
I'll try to find an extra ATX power supply.
I think so.
If not... what can I do?
Change the case and the mother together or...

In 2021, the most frequently used characters ranking ((GizMode Japan)) - Yahoo! News
My number one use is the crying sign.
I think it's an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, messaging apps and chat tools have made it possible for people to have pictorial reactions instead of stamps.
The speed, the ease, the no-reply, the no-show element.
It's essential to the soft, soft atmosphere that we cherish in modern communication!
And by the way, what font do you all use?
See the full list of the most used icons in 2021 and the top 10 most used icons in the world!
Overall, positive and bright graphics are ranked.
According to the original Unicode, 92% of the world's Internet population uses pictograms.
First of all, it's five percent of all graphics.
The first, the third, and the fifth cry-laugh characters are very handy, aren't they?
When it was fun, when it was happy, of course, I did it!
I'm sure there are a lot of people who self-abuse when they feel like they can't do anything.
On the other hand, if you've never used one of the top 10 pictograms, you're a rarity.
I want you to emulate that style.
There are 30 new cases of coronavirus in the military... all of them breakthrough infections.
On the 12th, the number of new coronavirus infections in the Korean military increased by 30 from the previous day.
All the new cases were breakthrough infections.
The South Korean Ministry of Defense announced the cumulative number of new coronavirus infections in the military at 2 p.m. on the same day as 2713, an increase of 30 from the previous day.
Sixteen were from the Army, six from the Navy, six from the Air Force, and two from other units.
Of the cumulative infections, 360 patients are currently being treated and managed, bringing the cumulative number of infections at this day's breakthrough to 977.
The previous day's 36 new infections accounted for 33 of the breakout cases.

I've only brought it in once, but it's in the city of Matsuyama, but they won't take it back for free from Matsuyama Prefecture.
(It's free if it's relatively new.)
* Inverted net
I've never used it, but it's completely free of charge.
I'm going to try it out, so I'd like to know what you think about it.
* Bulky rubbish, etc. (charged), note: Municipal collection boxes (small household appliances free of charge)
* They sell second-hand.
Mercalli, the hard-off.
I've never sold a second-hand computer.
Maybe it's a good idea to sell it as soon as it's profitable.
I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm not going to tell you what I'm talking about. I'm not going to tell you what I'm talking about. I'm not going to tell you what I'm talking about. I'm not going to tell you what I'm talking about.
There's nowhere to take it, and there's a broken printer, and there's an old UPS that's getting in the way.
It's not the size of a piece of junk, so it probably won't cost you any money, but somehow it's being pushed forward.
I collect coins as a hobby.
If you know how much this coin is worth, tell me.
The coins in circulation abroad have no value...
Banknotes are exchanged in Japan, but coins are not.
A commemorative gold coin has a value because it contains gold.
He didn't do anything wrong, but he hates you sometimes, doesn't he?

She can't, but is she being discriminated against because of her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that it's up to you to decide what it looks like.
I can't show you what's inside.
What happened to your school sweatpants after you graduated?
I wear it as a casual outfit.
I threw it away as soon as I graduated.
And I've been using it as a piece of furniture until we started living together. (Laughter)

Hopefully, they'll be easy to care for, evergreen trees, and fruit trees, if possible.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Other fruit trees, such as olives, blueberries, plums, and others, should be planted nearby.
How much money do we have to save to live together?
It's every man for himself.
It depends on where you live and what you're involved with.
We should stop living together.
There's a good chance they'll break up.
It is better to make friends, to have a wedding feast, to go to a bridal feast, to have a wedding feast, and to have a banquet.
Cohabitation has no merit.
I don't think we should do this.
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Masked Rider Battle Gambler.
Oh, I thought it was Legendary, but it was a re-recorded Legendary.
