Wegen Omikron: Johnson will Auffrischimpfung vorantreiben
ron-Families have always been a source of political and scientific influence in Great Britain.
New Year's Eve is the time when all the eligible men in England receive their invitation cards.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be able to make a rapid diagnosis of the Corona-Affection with the help of the rapid Omikron-Test even faster than before.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster shot by the end of the year, said Johnson on Sunday in a video message to his followers.
's date has been delayed until the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that the campaigning organizations can also be active in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish territories.
Johnson said that the Omikron variant of the Notfall was dangerous, so the Impfschutz should be tightened.
good news is that the level of protection can be raised again with a third dose.
, "Let us now boast!" said Johnson.
On Monday, 1239 more Omikron-Falls were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
compared to the previous day, the rise was 65 percent.
the full amount will be refunded at the return?

-warning: I will write something detailed about the household violence here.
me just have to write something about the soul.
(21) I come from a job-related background more often with the problems (and temptations) of home violence in contact.
A theme that is very much on my mind and unfortunately very often comes up is that many victims do not get help or we could not help them.
I'm pretty sure that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But in my job there are fewer things that make me feel more stressed than when I can't do anything about it.
I see the blue flecks, the blood, the staring eyes...
But even in conversation, with four eyes, I cannot reach the other.
I don't know what the point is, maybe it's fear, fear of the unknown, fear of leaving the known social field, fear of bringing children into this.
I would like to be able to always make everything clear, sometimes even very close to tears, so that everyone can live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to take it easy.
I wish I could help you in every case... I know I can't.
will be done, but never.
Please think about it, you are worth living without violence, that is so important.

Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
est on youngster Johannes Patrick.
: The Red Lions lost again: for the second time in three months they lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, John Patrick, the trainer of Ludwigsburg's team, had a look at the cup match against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in October: "We still have something to worry about."
didn't take part in the game after all - but was still given a 61.72% (28:38) - penalty in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where the result was more than the naked ambition, the art and skill of the achievement were revealed.
Stellvertretend sei eine Statistik genannt, which the whole dilemma summarizes: The Dreier Quote was exactly 13 percent, 4 treffer (all from the young Johannes Patrick) at say and write 31 attempts - and still questions?
John Patrick's answer: "We were just not concentrated enough at Teneriffa, and didn't take advantage of what we were trained for."

"Good game, second time around against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
he felt as if he had been with 10,000 people.
There were only 750 people allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came for free.
not least also due to T.J. Shorts, the 22-point scorer and the player who led his team to victory.
Gleim was the best trainer I ever had.
's While in Patrick's team, the leading scorers were Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7).
The Red Lions were saved from a total debacle at the last quarter (22:15) and came back with eight points, after they had already lost 39:59.
Justin Simon came in second with twelve points.

He wants to make his audience aware of new interpretations of Schlagern from the 20th and the 21st centuries.
He is currently on the program "Good morning, happy birthday" - if he can make it.
Max Raabe really wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on Sunday.

The Federal Minister for Housing, Klara Geywitz, said: "There is no new housing."
The new Bundesminister for Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the building of large housing estates, as has been done in Berlin in a popular referendum.
With a sense of humor, Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sonntag): "No new house is built, only the structure of the owner's house is changed."

a good mix of private, community, and housing developments is the best protection against a monopoly image.
Berlin will see the SPD, Greens and Links party form an expert commission, as the result of the election has shown.
If the situation doesn't improve, the Geywitz will not talk to the FDP in the Ampel-Koalition about further reforms in the housing market.
The coalition agreement sees a housing benefit until 2029, a restriction on housing price rises in the free market and a calculation of the housing benefit.
I will speak to the Justice Minister as soon as possible.
"If the coalition negotiations don't succeed, we will have to talk to the coalition partners about further steps," said the SPD politician.

Help in the first campaign.
to the rescue!
I just got back from a group of four friends on the Greifenpass and I want my heroes to run a campaign specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big book is made, the good will and their motivation written, the individual acts considered, and now I'm here, the start of the adventure to write and already at the first encounter over my own nose.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a forge with tools from Gratenfels in a small town near the Thuran Sees.
should develop the further action.
Some miles from the town, the heroes should find a group of goblins and lock them in a cave.
I want the character to have the opportunity to confront the adversary in different ways: to be surprised, to act, to be hurt, to know the danger at all times, which also always amuses the player.
8 common goblin, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and arrows.
When the goblin heroes were not paying attention, the goblins led them on a blind alley and flanked me on three sides and one on the other, while two with spears stopped the boat.

The heroes were all found and welcomed by the son of the schoolmaster, a half-brother.

If a need arises, this half-elf with two of his fingers will come to the aid of the heroes.

I am a big fan of F1 racing.
Hello F1 fans, quality on the German sky has always been lower, so I wanted to make a little air with this post.
first time today the transmission was cut off midway through the F2-race to allow the start of the F1-pre-race briefing.
Even though the start was delayed and the start time was pushed back a lot, you could still see the last ten minutes (and the championship decision!)
seems to be so, that the F1 regulations are used for political reasons and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice.
ly Sky UK has still managed to get the race over to the UK.
: Even though a small lob: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation with great skill.
Then there was a rule-breaker in the F1 again by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both didn't know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Even though this situation has already happened in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires, as there were relevant questions about this topic for Hamilton.
Sky UK and RTL immediately noticed that this opportunity was available to Verstappen.
I think that such elementary rules should be known by anyone who watches F1 on a pay-TV channel.
is also not the first rule, which is now written or already possible, both have just constant security in the topic of rules.
generally doesn't like the taste of Roos's commentary, but the taste is the thing.
, But I like Ernsthaupt even more than Heiko Wasser from RTL.
There are constant advertisements, which just plain annoy, like the selling of coffee by (also annoying) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
ly. The last one brings a lot of unpleasantness into the comment, which he obviously doesn't appreciate.
Not the last, the advertising is simply over the top at Sky, in the Sky box is Sky the only sender of the advertising, as you can see at F1TV you can only watch the German commentary without commentary right after the race.
neither ServusTV nor ORF broadcast it.
also these two senders make less advertising in the trainings than sky, and this as free-TV-sender.
Glock and Baumgartner should have been shot down for their work, but that alone doesn't make me feel any better.
F1's boring program is also very repetitive and full of sound effects.
ly Sky is really the worst German-language F1 source, which is overloaded with F1.
Unironically, RTL has made the four races they are still allowed to broadcast a better job.
So, in any case, the grandiose F1 season makes it much less fun than it would be with a reliable driver.
would be interesting to you.
Auf the table: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, Messing and more glazed glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should have been delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it would be delivered on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I bought two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 2019.
of them already had a defect (the material had a hole in the upper part of the handle).
for your support.
ur Lüfterpumps are particularly suitable for supplying an aquarium with saltwater.
it is also possible to use a filter system over a heating system.
te This series will be offered in three versions from us.
the end of the advertisement in the table.
you can see the differences in the results.
The pumps are strong enough, so you can run all the equipment.
a large aquarium suitable for pumping with 2 or more outlets, so that you can have several pumps.
The MK-Series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but also an air pump, for example with a fan (find it in our shop) or a decor, which changes the air flow.
would be a good name for a cat, mouse, or something like that.
MK-Series has a special, custom-built construction and works so well for low-power applications.
installation is very simple.
The Lufterpumpe is connected to a 4/6 mm air hose...and already it can move.
should be the same, or higher than the water level and exposed on the outside.
the air vent should be set between the water and the toilet seat.
the smoke was simply blown out and the ventilator was set between the two.
it would prevent the water from going back if it were to run backwards through the pipes...
. If the Lufthansa jet is to be released, you, like other jets, should be hidden and protected from fire.
The MK-Series pumps are true energy savers, which use little energy.
Even if we give the shipping time with 3 days on eBay, it will be packed daily and the package will be also daily here picked up.
under the hood everything is fine, it's very fast.
we just want to give a little warning so no one gets hurt, just because it happened once.
so... But no one understands the whole team, who also work in the expedition...of course here no Corona stops...
Please don't rate it so low, just because the delivery was delayed, that's just a matter of the package.
... Man naturally shudders at these things, even if we are saying...they are really difficult...
is also regional very different.
, Be kind, be healthy, and we all hope that it will be better times.
it takes how long to buy the red ones with and without armhole?
you can also buy the beer in hell here?
Astronaut's daughter and moderator are sent to the world.
The first American-born child in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers had a short flight into outer space.
were transported on Saturday from the rocket system "New Shepard" of the firm Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
and landing of the round-the-world flight in the US state of Texas was found.
ly under blue skies, Bezos flew the most personal astronaut back to Earth.
Welcome back, said Bezos, in a blue uniform as he opened the door to Luke's cell.
under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers flew back and forth and around the Amazon founder.
after Blue Origin's instructions, they were ten minutes and thirteen seconds under way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
Laura Shepard Churchley, 74, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard, who was named for the rocket system of Blue Origin, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of the firm, who paid the other four passengers for their tickets: Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and Cameron, his son.
Blue Origin didn't tell them how much they were paying for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's short flight to the mission.
worked hard at his studies and had to do everything himself.
You are just so boring, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also shocked.
The moderator said, "He would like to go back to the all again, if possible."
New Shepard flies at a height of 100 kilometers.
's New Shepard system flies automatically.
The capsule that was launched from the rocket reached a height of about 100 kilometers over the earth, sometimes with great difficulty, before it was destroyed by the falling debris.
International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers over the earth as the limit of the atmosphere, but there is no international agreement.
was already the third major all-aircraft carrier of Blue Origin. At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US airwoman and a 18-year-old German.
On the second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner there, who is famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", along with the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the CEO of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
critics have taken Bezos and Blue Origin to task for the business with the space tourism that goes on without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Jem who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry.
I studied biochemistry for the first semester and found the subject actually quite interesting and also in the laboratory it didn't strain me (I already had organic chemistry practice behind me).
I was already informed about career prospects before the course but also still, that I want to study until promotion.
me at the moment, especially when it comes to career prospects.
On one side you hear always super job offers and the job is totally sought, on the other side you hear always of unemployed biologists and unpaid positions.
I would be very interested.
what are you working on right now?
you are happy with your work/ salary?
3) Have you studied/ What kind of training have you had?
you want to do that all the time?
thanks for your answers!
I'm really unsure right now and consider dropping out of college and getting a degree in computer science.
you have experience, write it down, too:)
Extra stress before holidays and weekends.
topic came up last week at my place.
I had to use my long weekend to get myself together.
, Now there's a light.
Not only during the holidays, like Christmas, there is a lot of stress in our business.
looks like it's going to be a busy weekend.
It was just so. Last week was Mary's birthday, which is called "Affair" in Switzerland.
most people and businesses make a Friday, which is semi-official.
also a long 4-day weekend at home.
was also last week?
all stress.
Lauter E-Mails, which you must certainly have already received, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
...well...
"Next week" sounds so long and it's not right?
Or because people all want to work as much as they can in a week?
not only was I upset on Wednesday, but also terrified.
this self-talk is for the occasion?
we have no more holidays, if we can't take them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple. Are we just the Swiss?
is this our reformed evangelical art?
you know that in the north as well?

DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the Lok was in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland in use, the very rare Lok probably comes from the model ME Heft 11/1968, used with spare parts and missing parts, see photos, function good, The E 95 is a heavy diesel locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), the Lok was used with heavy coal loads in the German railway network, the Lok probably comes from the small firm Zschutzche and Bachmann.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on it.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had AEG as a competitor in 1924, proposing a locomotive powered by electric motors, which could carry 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passengers at a speed of 45 km/h.
65 km/h was the speed limit.
The DRG was established in March 1926 for the delivery of the 1’Co+Co1’ Locomotive with Tatzlager-Antrieb AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
The delivery of six locomotives, numbered E 95 01–06, took place from December 1927 to June 1928.
Second World War was fought and the DDR territory was recovered after the war.
the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union in 1946 as reparations.
you remained in Germany until November 1952.
work on the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau has been completed.
When the need for fast electric locomotives for the heavy freight service became urgent, in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were rebuilt, the old engines being used as spare parts.
was first built with E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger quantities.
t When the E 94 was first put into service, the number of workable cycles could not be increased, so the E 95 was put into service as a backup.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed at Leipzig-Wahren station.
They came to work at Halle P in 1960.
You were mostly used to the Umlaufplan Kohlenzügen from the Geiseltal in Richtung Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
tying with the complicated taxation of the locomotives.
came to pass again, that Schütze at Schalthandlungen was killed.
the man who was constantly on the train had to constantly remove the brake blocks while the train was in motion.
accidents to the motor cars came frequently and caused frequent breakdowns of the locomotive.
At the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and the electrification of the railway was not yet completed, so the Reichsbahn could use old locomotives and most of the splitter tracks, so the E 95 was not used.
Hinzu kam bei ihnen, that the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotiven only wanted to hire men, which would have been a problem in the operation of the machines and the sighting of the trains because of the difficulties of the track.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in May 1969, the E 95 01 followed them as the last service on October 5, 1970.
255 001 was never used as the new name.
on the E 95 02 all the locomotives were stopped.
E 95 02 was used as an alternative to the future Museumslokomotive E 77 10 as a waiting room at the Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time until the responsible officials at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
1979 began the first large-scale testing of the locomotive with the goal of presenting it to a public audience at the RAW Dessau.
since then, you have been designated as a museum locomotive.
1986 saw the completion of the inner locomotive.
DB Museum Halle (Saale) is to be used as a museum train.
1995, Mitarbeiter der Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P work on the maintenance of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was first presented at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, where the transformers were tested and five locomotives were available for operation.
The locomotives stood on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn until 1945 and on the sidings in use, where they were selected for their reliable service and low maintenance costs.
machines were transported to Leipzig in February 1945 for use in the middle east.
The main battlefield was first in Schleswig.

PKV / What's a "cover-up"?
Hello, together.
We were a bit in child custody, now that the PKV is coming up, this is a bit of a problem.
The series is called:
t We had the PKV procedure in the field and had the surgeries over 3 attempts.
attempts were made in a particular way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.)
The first attempt resulted in successful pregnancy and birth and was terminated with the PKV.
We tried to get a second child, and had 2 (successful) attempts, but these still don't seem to work with the PKV.
us again the cost of the PKV and again took 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts (we have tried more than was said, logically the last with the PKV would be the last) we received the invoices from the PKV and received the big shock: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only gave us 3 attempts.
: The reason: The first two attempts to breed the first generation failed.
second wish is a new insurance claim.
The AGB is true, but "the accident begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment is no longer necessary."
the questions to the experts here.
Who has the right to the PKV (only 3 attempts are allowed) or us (we have 5 attempts to make)?
the PKV must have indicated in the results that with a birth the further attempts failed?
The desire for a second child is really a new insurance risk?
The unfruitfulness (due to the unwillingness of the first couple) will not be a problem.
it would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
thanks again for your help!

Hello.
The EU is bound to pay high costs for the "Halber Sieg" against Belarus.
The EU can in the conflict with the Russian regime give the political expert Raphael Bossong a "half-siege".
The costs were, however, very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus," Bossong said to the Evangelical Pressedienst (epd).
The EU has not been able to resolve the confrontation, explained the Berliner Stiftung Researcher for Science and Politics (SWP).
This web-stand - Belarus doesn't give us very small, but the EU feels itself as a winner - maybe it will go on for a while.
Bossong's statement was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, he said.
ly It is obvious that there is a "non-standardization of pushbacks" by individual EU regulations.
the EU as a whole is not to be taken seriously, go ahead and take the cost of the basic rights.
development is also slowing the union's growth.
It is impossible for a member state to open its borders to migrants, as is currently the case in Poland, even though the EU's border control agency Frontex has not once allowed access to the border.
Here is Bossong: The EU should pay a higher price for its policy towards Belarus, so that the line "Grenzschutz, Grenzschutz, Grenzschutz" is emphasized, as the line is being used as a pretext for the asylum policy.
Try to cross the border without being noticed.
after the information from the Polish border guards, the migrants tried again, to cross the Belarusian border into the Polish territory.
55 Migrants were seated on Sunday night at the border and returned to Germany, said a spokeswoman of the border police on Sunday.
Polish officials were found near the village of Czeremsza, near the border with the steel workers.
following the information, a soldier was injured and had to be treated by a military doctor.
the total number of registered border guards 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
already on Sunday a group of 28 migrants had been detained for breaching the curfew.
Ten thousand people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had the border between Belarus and the EU overpassed or tried to.
Alexander Lukaschenko is being held as a hostage in Minsk by the EU, which hopes to have him released in the near future.
and Lithuania have reported on the news items in accordance with the guidelines.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and banned airlines from flying to the country. Migrants and refugees were sent to the country.
the EU Commissioner for Human Rights, to bring about a change in the situation in the occupied territories.
Bossong said that the most important element of the EU reaction was the pressure on air traffic.
The EU has seized its market power in the media and its censorship under the pretext of morality and extraterritorial sanctions.
also consider the political costs of Minsk.
The Belarusian society is not likely to be aware of the regular arrests of hundreds of people by the security forces.
Mercedes protested after the Formula 1 final.
Max Verstappen should have driven two laps around the Mercedes during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has given the green light.
silver spoons were awarded to the same number of rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is based on a dangerous overtake by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, as he was supposed to stop.
second impulse was added to the evaluation at the end of the race.
the protocol was not followed in Mercedes's eyes.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last race and was still ahead of him in Formula 1 championship.
The maneuver succeeded shortly after the end of a safety-car phase, during which the Niederländer had driven his car over.
it is tested.
I speak to the bank and will call again.
Thanks for the support.

ten Tannen. Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, look for women who sell Christmas trees.
Frank Diers, landowner, has already experienced several such situations in the sale of hay.

Problem/Glass breaker + Devolo DLan/Magic Problem/Glass breaker
ly We have had a new glass door installed in the house for the past few weeks.
I have a problem now, I can't get a stable wifi connection.
I had an earlier DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit uninterruptedly until a few drops.
The new glass fiber cable connects 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives this.
However, the other DLan Modul, which the Wifi module is connected to, no longer comes with 500, but only with a little more (also use a small dose, which removes 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces from the other Modul).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now faster than before (\~45 Mbit).
, I also bought a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
this war much easier than the DLan, but there was also a lot of loss.
someone could explain to me why with a glass-fiber-reinforced polymer so much Internet speed is lost over the transmission of the "verloren geht"?
LAN is really the only solution?
would be extremely inconvenient, to have to install LAN cable in the house.
I'm really upset, so I created an extra account here.
I would be more than happy with an answer.
When it's time to switch the account,
who would have thought, now there is rest at the Giroconti, it seems to be a relief.
While many banks used the holiday to confirm their pricing practices of the past, the freebies for negative balances also continued.
Deutsche Bank, for example, has been trading with a margin of 100,000 Euro for a long time.
she has already earned the free money and even spent the day's wage.
In a first step, the limit was only set for customers of the consortium Sparte Postbank - on 50,000 Euro for Giro and Anlagen and 25,000 Euro for Tagesgeldkonten.

not only for new products, but also for "individual new combinations of products"
Commerzbank was already on the brink of a 50,000 euro limit, which still applies, as it does with ING Germany.
ely. Die gerade bei kostenbewussten Kunden beliebte Direktbank DKB has cut the freebies in two steps, first to 50,000 Euro, and now to 25,000 Euro.
: Immerhin: More than 100 banks have received a fee of 25,000 Euro or less from Verivox, for example.
Bank Sparda Berlin, too, has been paid 25,000 Euro: nevertheless, there is still a real fight going on with the consumer organizations, which in the first instance successfully challenged this regulation before the Berlin Landgericht.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should be allowed to make such returns - for the case that even the top institutes have to explain the negative returns in the main as unreasonable and that many millions of bank customers have to be refunded.

Hello, ladies and girls and women.
I have a lot to say that I just want to write down and maybe someone else will...
I'm 24, have a Bachelor's degree, and am a full-time student - but I have to admit that my dog doesn't bark or goes to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my kid.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has had a seizure 2. Grades on Monday and has been depressed (but now in therapy).
I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, we had a lot of fun and it was nice.
him I have burned at the stake (since hand is in the band of burning).
He is happy now and we see less (1-2x per week) what makes me happy and love very much.
My dog has just had a seizure, I gave him some water and he is lying in his crate and is a bit upset after I tried to stroke him with the watering can and he bit me.
live alone with my sister and mother, and she's going away for a month.
now comes also housework on us, which we naturally do not do.
cooking is actually a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is just fine, I'm halfway through therapy and I'm doing well.
, Not good, but I'm fine and I'm almost symptom-free.
My uni is really demanding (for me), tomorrow at 15 I have a written test I haven't done yet and over the weekend I have an anatomy class I should have prepared for.
next week I have a test on Wednesday, and what comes up in my calendar is not in my head because there is no more room.
So goes my week: only until over night, then it's Friday.
But then, what about the whole thing?
only until the birthday.
only until the end of the holidays.
only until next week.
...just until...
so it is forever set.
I believe I'm just so tired, that I need those spiritual boosts, otherwise I would pack up and leave.
I feel guilty and "chaotic" somehow, but I don't feel that way...
you feel the same way?
, Ehrlich, I am very grateful that I don't have to work.
, This is really wonderful, I can't put it into words.

I believe that this is a film for the youth.

with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design, no problem!
20 liter fuel capacity also allows larger photo-engraving without problems, which can be safely carried out with the equipped FlexFold-Teiler.
And what else do you need, remains practical access to the individual configurable interior space well organized and easily accessible from the photo storage.
the Everyday Line with the update on the version 2 (V2) presents the series in a new look.
The minimalist design has a lot to offer - with the Everyday Backpack Series Peak Design has developed some innovative solutions that make the interior of the backpack as comfortable as possible and at the same time provide fast access to the photo function.
works with two possibilities: once conventionally over the deck lock, which can be closed with the MagLatch-Close System, a surprisingly effective solution for effective protection, which already has been awarded to Messenger Bags.
was in the locker a metal locker with a passable lock on the front of the rucksack.
Anders as with most of the other Peak Design bags has considered the "Fullness" of the bag: there are four different "depths", stabilized, in which the compression can be activated.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top strap, if it's rather light, a thicker one.
and the clapping and the hand are also magnetically.
the rucksack can be closed so tightly that the straps don't come undone.
second possibility also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, Fotorucksacks: besides the deckle keyhole there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
eliminates the biggest drawback of common household items with access from above - you don't have to look through the content anymore!
ely quick detail raises the overall comfort of the backpack enorm: If you, for example, don't only take your photo, but also carry everyday items or a travel bag, this is very useful.
You can customize the inner space of the Everyday Backpack (see below) and store both problems separately - and you can access both openings independently.
So you can also take the right side of the backpack from the front of the body, for example to access the camera control on the right main page, while the daily items remain in the left side of the backpack and don't come between.
, Bequeme, uncompliziert verstellbare Tragegurte help here.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event changed the history of the West Coast.
a man discovered in winter 1848 a man in the southern end of the American River, a lighted rock in the water.

en Tausend came from all directions and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flowering cities of the land.
es was cleared, the streets were blocked, and saloons and hotels were established almost overnight.
every one wanted his share of the land.
many people say, "Coloma or Bust!"
You're a pioneer in this game, looking for opportunity in the West and making a name for yourself.
you will look for gold, recruit workers, train horses, and build a business.
You will also have the opportunity to visit the surrounding areas and the river banks.

You choose your actions, you have to hold your resources and build a table, which is more and more for you "works" (called "Engine Building").
the building on your map allows you to be efficient, to receive additional actions or to use rules for your guns.
with these houses and the dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual style with the help of clever arrangements.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California officially became a state).
in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players are asked to choose a home location on the board, where they can perform actions.
will then be revealed and their pioneers will be placed on the appropriate positions.

Then the players switch actions, such as winning resources, driving cars, planting trees, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and placing revolvermen.
the pioneers go back when all the actions are completed.
the caller changes the starting point for each round and thus changes the available actions.

The Anstoß came from u/edizVEVO, the project that has been popular in the last days and has found a simple, simply said, Schnappsstore.
several people from the community have found each other, who have the desire to revive the project.
But I still want to make a final call on all this, to be sure, just so that this project can continue in the future.

Thank you very much for that, for putting up with me here for so long, I also had a year in the state service in a similar job, we were also Waffen-Traders in the Executive, I don't want to go any further!
I always find the question about right and left very puzzling.
ly. Grundsätzlich one should say that the state diener is rather from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.

But even these Rand groups also participate if it once sounds funny to my experience of a conservative attitude, speak loudly for Germany and feel themselves more or less excluded by overly left-wing politics, even if this politics is meant for them to fit in, or they just want to be treated quite normally.
back to the rights, of course, police and street fights are also a part of society, you will also find extreme rights there, that they can even openly express their opinion there or even openly oppose any state-sponsored plans that annoy me a lot.
of course, it comes before even policemen and soldiers who often went abroad in the service often began to joke and even say things that are politically incorrect.
also comes before there is a certain number of people who meet regularly to discuss the right to free speech.
still, all this is done in my opinion well and also with political education and enlightenment for the whole!
Germany is so internationalized and that is also good for my opinion that we couldn't possibly have right-wingers and Nazis in our midst!
Yes, I didn't understand, I also bought the other Korb on the German page.
why should this come from England?
I bought it, but it wasn't sold.
I already ordered in November.

career in social work - as someone with a self-defeating personality?
I have a degree in software development and have been working in the field for about a year.
Unfortunately, I have to pay more and more for this job, so I have been thinking about it for a long time, and I have to study social work again.
problem: I have an unpleasant (or annoying) personality disorder (AVPD).
that means that I don't have any self-esteem and that I'm a bit of a snob.
I have no problem with that, speaking to people on a personal level, but it was very difficult for me to talk to people and I already knew that I was not understood (whereas I already believed that I was understood).
I can become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in a youth project but rather in, for example, the search project or the family help.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really as it is as I told you, and it's difficult to find anything on the Internet.
The APS is already causing problems for me in my job (emotional), because it makes me cry every time something goes wrong with my code ("just another simple thing to fix") and it is hard to find colleagues willing to help ("I should really know how this works"/"I have to keep him on his toes"/"he has to really listen to me" etc.).
The problem will probably be in every job but I wanted to be selected for it.

Before I came here now .. short: I need a friend and preferably someone who knows my situation - also from you.
I made the Ref as a querry.
I studied something else and also worked in that area (at least anonymously, I mean, I didn't do anything specific).
was then too long and I had to look for alternatives that would make me more comfortable.
I was fired from my last job, and I was sure that was it - even though the job requirements were much more flexible than in my previous job, but that was the same.
I'm now at the third "I google other spellings".
is only half a year old.
I always regretted not doing more and ending the Ref, so I can still remember it.
, But I'm absolutely fine.
had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
is now a vacation, but there is still a job waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but here was my weekday and my weekend my weekend.
I was free.
The stress on the job was equal at the time.
is now my family's annual holiday too much stress.
Then there are these strange structures that make me feel nervous.
Basically, it makes sense and the feedback is also good, which is what feedback is all about.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely breaks down - if it doesn't already.
I ask myself if I want to have the rest of my work life here - just, if I read some of your posts here -, or if I don't want to go back to the old area, where I was treated unfairly, and where I had free time, when I needed it, and the work was somehow long, but paid for and done in a team, instead of as an individual, like the current situation is.
, But then I ask myself, if I will ever again be in the same place as now and unhappy.
, You are welcome, it's all very weird, but maybe you have a friend or idea, as I did from this situation, that I am completely finished and almost at the smallest thought about it, came out.
I'm not feeling emotional right now, so that probably won't do any good.
But maybe you could help me out, so that at least I can see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or Christmas, which is just as good for me as the first.
for reading and for forgiving my bad tone.
, I hope my situation is at least somewhat clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix Series of VOX has been continuously developed, which has led to the combination of the highly sophisticated modeling technology with the "valve reactor" concept, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a valve.
with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we set up a brand new modeling engine, which in sound is absolutely on the cutting edge of technology.
thanks to the virtual element technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and the switches, the VTX boosters are waiting for an authenticity which is absolutely surprising.
also these amps contain the most common Valvetronix-Röhrenvorverstärker.
ly can do. This is often the case with true analog switches, because these are the variations and nuances of a good tone-enhancer much easier to reproduce than any simulation.ly can do.
bly enhanced. In addition to this excellent tuning, the VTX-Verstärker offers a closed house and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances are only so pleasantly enhanced.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX you can even correct historical facts on the virtual stage and play them back, until the amp and effects sound as if you were already playing them.
combination of the perfect sound of the VOX valve reactor technology with the modeling technology is to be commended in the first place.
Selbstverständlich wurde sie seither mehrfach verfeinert, um auch neu hinzugekommenen Sound-Anforderungen zu genügen, was anno 2010 erneut zu einem Leistungsschub der VOX Valvetronix Serie geführt hat - mit mehr Dynamik sowie zahlreicheren und entscheidend verbesserten Verstärkermodellen.
The new VT+ Valvetronix-Series was created from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two valves, so that all guitarists are able to find a maximum sound variety here.
Guitarists dream of the sound and dynamics of a great amplifier: They expect a great sound, a nuanced sound reproduction, a powerful bass and a clear voice.
While analyzing a sample, the VOX engineers discovered that the most important factor in determining the sound character of a resonator was the endstiffness and developed the VOX valve reactor technology based on this finding.
valve reactor control valve of every VT+-valve regulator forms the behavior, the subtle nuances and the character of a valve regulator perfectly.

Vulkanic eruptions on La Palma: the longest of the volcanic history
ely been three months since the beginning of the invasion, the Lavastrom have suffered great losses on the Kanarian island.

85 years ago the Vulkan eruption on La Palma was the longest in the known history of the Canary Islands.
the Vulkans Tehuya broke in 1585 with 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic Ocean before the West Coast of Africa.
over the past few years there are no reliable data.
The activity of the still nameless Vulkan in the Cumbre Vieja has in the past days taken some toll, but Vulkanologists were not able to make any predictions, when it would end.
ors Indicators showed a desire for peace.
The other news is that they are stable," said the president of the island's governing party, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-run TV station RTVE.
Schaden in Millionenhöhe
In the short three months since the beginning of the eruption, the fast-moving lava has destroyed more than 1,000 houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
1200 hectares were covered with a dark lava.

more than 7,000 residents must be evacuated, the damages will be more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new landfills were created by lava with a size of about 50 hectares.
The island was particularly badly hit by the devastating banana crop, from which about half the population depends directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcano erupted.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, more land heavily damaged, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts.
is Christmas standing before the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the magical festival.
many beautiful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the cheerful spirit of the season.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional celebrations that still keep our divided society together.
The most important thing is to know the traditional Christmas custom of giving gifts, so that the gesture of giving, which Marcel Mauss, a French sociologist and ethnologist, called the "contract of society with the natural peoples," could be fulfilled again in the context of this tradition.
How was the Christ child born?
were the Protestants, by which the Christmas season was associated with fasting.
gifts were exchanged on Nikolausday.
The background of this still famous place is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, three nights ago secretly gave gold to the women in their window so that they could live a better life in sin.
from this unconventional art of cooking came the famous German need, the steamer especially for filling children's baskets.
Protestants reject this use of the word, because they reject the mediation of saints as "heiligenverehrung".
themselves against the institution on these grounds.
Martin Luther made the Christ child from the Nikolaus and thus established a new tradition.
focus of the prayers shifted to the holy night.
Most Protestants no longer see such a detail question as so important, but only the smallest number of them still regard the use of the holy Nicholas as similar to the use of the Martin's mug and the Martin's beer as still a very important part of the Christmas season.
find one today in Stiefeln, before the tree and under the Christmas tree of Socken to the most luxurious goods, what the heart desires.
Many traditions in Christian lands.
s The feast of Saint Nicholas dates back to the 13th century.
of the Reformation, the day of rest was changed to Sunday.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy-go-lucky attitude towards the question of who is to bring the gifts to the children.
in Germany it depends on the region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a sort of Nikolaus, to whom some special attributes have been assigned.
Here are for example his white rauschebart, which is only slightly more common than the even stricter assyrerbart of the historical figure, his slippers, which are rented out by the hour, and the desire of the camins, to get into the houses.
the holy Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas festival in the Netherlands.
In Spain the Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy the Holy Child Befana is supposed to give them the way to Jesus.
bringen zuweilen Fabelwesen the gifts in Scandinavia, while in Russia it was the frosty vats that were the gifts.
aren't there any rentiers here, but three horses, who are as troika, their tails wagging.

Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I hope I do everything right here, it's been a year since my first post.
For my problem: I had a bout of depression again about five years ago, especially because I had such terrible symptoms during the period and I had no idea what PMS was.
Now I would like to stay here, because I have to take enough medication to cure me of chronic diseases, which I can't take.
ely my main problem is not the pain, but my hair.
I had a pretty good 0 to 100 mph acceleration test with this car and it was all over the place.
as high as it is, but I was very well taken care of and I didn't feel any pain.
has been normalised in the two years.
perhaps he has some tips on how to do this better.
My cosmetics are already free of perfume and without alcohol, but maybe there's something else that someone can recommend.
t I was unfortunately not taken seriously by the doctor and the doctor's appointment came even later.
to everyone who has read the Roman: thank you!
the love of the dress is so nice.
Vorbupertär has had a terrible case of neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then a big flare-up of acne and the acne theme.
I also tried to eat healthy, but I was starving, because otherwise nothing works so well.
It can also be good that Hormonel is just the worm, but if you have as much as I have all the rest will just lead you to look for something else that is still wrong.
I had already taken all her seminars o. a.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered on my behalf.

Ref: Educational plan (EK)
Hello, dear classmates and fellow students.
I have been in the Ref since summer, the teaching makes me happy, but I have a big problem at the moment to plan my teaching in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not technologically well equipped, so I can only use the table, the textbook, and an OHP as a medium.
can I copy this in school for free (which is a bit expensive).
I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
ely example we make the current topic Geofactors, and for me it really is every minute.
I also always repeat the methods, but I also want to invest little time in simple lessons (I also need it for UBs).
I go to the planning really from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then I check how I can build it (usually I start with a text book with texts that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the questions in the book I'm rather unsatisfied.
also the newspapers.
maybe I can find a teacher of English as efficient as a bookkeeper.
me made happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I'd like to return it as soon as possible.

only in a few cases can the victim be identified.
The deal holds the for unnecessary and dismisses Umsatzinfrage.
has also paraphrased.
The 2G rules were abolished by the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE) in the face of the important Christmas trade.
In companies with products of the non-essential need, the HDE chief executive officer Stefan Genth criticized the use of Umsatzeinbrüche.
of the HDE's current survey of 1100 retailers showed more than 70% of the businesses negative on the remaining days of the year.
many would have already written off the Christmas trade.
"Nowadays, the positive high point of the year should be a loch without a boat," said Genth.
A handicapped person lost a third of his earnings in the previous week.

the organization demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe opportunity, said the chief executive.
, "2G at the shopping mall brings us no further in the fight against the pandemic."
current regulations frightened customers and required high personnel investment.
he demanded that the ban on the Bändchenregelung be extended throughout the country.
Each customer should only be controlled once on 2G (active or idle) and would have received a notification on this day to all businesses.
In the meantime, it should be sufficient to carry out control tests in the individual case, as already in the public transport with the 3G rule (e.g. tested, approved or tested and approved).
also the specialised real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke about a difficult Christmas trade.
Frequencies were last at a good 75 percent of the pre- Corona level, with the UMS at around 90 percent.
Wilhelm Wellner, chief executive of the "Wirtschaftswoche", said, "This figures will now be taken seriously by the Christmas market."

The lamp is built for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high brightness and high luminous efficacy.
for the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with a wide range of possibilities is required.
ness There are two standard temperature ranges: daylight and artlight.
It is also possible to set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.

and intuitive user interface.
's The light produced by the light bulb creates a very bright light with a very high quality, completely free of glare.
The beam of 120 degrees, with which you can see large areas with a small angle, is very useful.
also in small rooms or in briefings.
ely can change the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
is a great tool for both filming or working in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted at difficult locations.
the control panel is at the back of the light, it is made of buttons and a light display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current temperature in Kelvin.
There is still a slot for the NP-F Akkus (not in the box)
The storage has three settings for brightness and color temperature.
the settings of the individual settings on the storage plates can be changed simply by pressing the corresponding storage button for a long time.
The lamp controller stores the current state of the lamp when the switch is turned on, so that when the switch is turned off the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example if the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Battery life is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, which is achieved by the possibility of the business with the good NP-F battery.
often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can return to the already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has enough power - it's a battery tester with built in display - for each of the two battery indicators a value in the two display areas (the left one higher, the right one lower).
hereafter, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the light source with power.
the construction of the light bulb is very simple.

. "We wanted to party," Frankfurt said. "We wanted to celebrate Torrey's comeback against Leverkusen."
for a spectacular reaction by Eintracht Frankfurt.
22 minutes later, the last two-time Bundesliga champions of Hessen were eliminated from the next round of the Bundesliga.
But then the SGE turned, and within a good minute the frust over a great season start of the soul and watched furiously with 5:2. "It's madness, what the kids today are doing", shouted Trainer Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to each one of them, who was there", out.
There, he saw for the first time a man who was now on rank nine behind his expectations.
Schick had the Leverkusener with 2:0 in front.
then it happened, the SGE-Trainer was also impressed.
"The players then returned and showed a fantastic performance."
I'm happy with the performance, which we've shown, and naturally also with the result.
Even Christopher Lenz, the former world champion and his injured shoulder, could not stay on the field after the third game and his team-mates' morale suffered.
"I believe that our mentality is unusually large," said the 27-year-old and smiled at the result especially for the viewers.
was the party, the one we wanted to throw today.
Glasner, however, still holds the focus on himself, and he sees himself in a good light.
is unusual that we all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in a top-agreement.
work is top in our medical department, but also the players live professionally.
Now you will have to go "one step at a time and stay focused" and the tasks until the end of the year "keep this level".
The next match is already on Wednesday at the English week at Borussia Monchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I received the mail with my package, partly because of a mistake on my part, partly because of yours.
tried to send it to #PRS_ORG# and it wouldn't let me, no chance.
Can I have it sent to me again right away or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is re-confirmed?

The women's team against Spain in the quarterfinals.
Germany's women's handball team are upset by Denmark's demotion with hanging arms and vacant stares from the park.
At the end of the WM-Hauptrunde, the DHB-Auswahl was selected at 16:32 (8:13) in Granollers and must now face Spain's runner-up in the quarterfinals.
"We were too eager and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
we must act differently against Spain.
After the first set in the tournament, Germany's top group III lost 8:2 to the second place (10:0) behind the Danes.
it is a shame that we couldn't take the flow.
Emily Bölk, captain of the ship, said, "This was the worst game we ever played."
In the fight for a place in the semi-final on the coming Saturday, I must make a decisive step forward, to keep the terrible dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
est Danish wrestler in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was the wrestler Alina Grijseels with six gold medals.
"We were just not there - neither in the mood, nor in the mood to be guarded", said Xenia Smits, the backroom player, and demanded, "We must now quickly go back."
Not high, not low.
as in the last five tournaments the German team has not been able to score goals.
Faults in the attack and lapses in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 recovery after seven minutes.
ly Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the heating and prevented some of the parades from being cold.
the first Tor went to the DHB-Team at 9:30, as Grijseels successfully completed a quick sprint.
's The initial explosion was not the cause of the fire.
elyte.de The German women were hardly able to set foot in the scene - and even if they did, they usually stood in the starkest Althea Reinhardt in the Tor of the Scandinavian women.elyte.de
So war the game at 3:10 p.m. early, as the back row player Mia Zschocke later on for a foul on her opponent was red carded.
they can still use it in the quarterfinal.
in the last phase of the first half, the DSB selection came out better in the game and only lost five points until the break.
was only a brief hope of a change at 9:19.
The Green-Schutzlinge again offended in all fields and made it easy for the well-meaning opponent, who counts the medals, to do so.
The German team could not match the performance of the English team and was clearly outclassed by the park.

The title is before, I'm as a medical doctor in mobile teams active, in which (at least) the BioNTech/Pfizer-impfstoff v.a. is used in the medical field.
these are done to a large extent, so now it's time for me to go to the dentist.
ely I answered questions without time limits on the organizational and human aspects, and also medical questions, if these were not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, it causes me to have a rash..").
In my area, the diagnosis for the infection, the indication (person has an impulse to a Corona infection, and no reason, which is also true), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the aftercare for allergic reactions (I have never had it).
itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In Impfteams we have often no duly, but "nur" (for God's will no lack of value judgment!) pharmacist-technical assistants for the Impfstoffzubereitung, who however cannot do any Impfungen (can't?), so that I also most of the Impfungen myself do.
What a hard "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
is it a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, from an Amberger, it was in the BR-Fernsehsendung "Wir in Bayern" for serious thought.
But the word "host" was still in the same category as "host me" when it was accidentally misspelled.
"No, it wasn't a 'man who is nervous'."
also no one, "everything has to go quickly".
, The people on TV heard the moderator say that was completely wrong.
what the man from Amberg solved and thus also for many other Oberpfälzern was a source of pleasure.
der Huidlerer, the tourist, is a lap, with which someone opens the window.
Antony Rowley, a dialectologist from the Bayerische Fernsehen, has been a long-time expert on the subject, and confirmed it.
With the comment, this is a typical upper Austrian word, somehow related to the well-known Houdern.
a gap in education - also among some, who have lived in the space of Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books anymore for two weeks.

choice of tires for the car - really so dangerous?
Today tomorrow I am full of anticipation, because I still wanted to train a little for my upcoming road trip.
, Say, get it and I'll drive my brand new car, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
the first 40 kilometers were also really nice - but then it was so in every inner city (that time: thanks Krefeld!) that it was worth it.
on the street.
Zack, who likes to make faces and my backhand wanted to finish the rest of the stroke on no fault.
Since I didn't have a real chance to take care of my replacement parts and replacement oil, I had to go back to the garage and take the first train home.
war then also not so bad, maybe it's better, if I again drive the car with the gearbox.
now stand up and I hope you can help me.
I would have been very annoyed by this problem had I had a long streak of bad luck.
Now it's really not good, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who came to my place at around 14 hours with 120km on the clock!) and he also called them suboptimal, because he has been using them for years.
If I think about it, I have to drive at 80-90km/h to keep the speed limit, then I'm really in trouble:D
Now I'm with an old man at the bus stop, who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these should be flat.
sounds like a great idea.
these aren't really so uncapable?
I have little lust to pay 40€/roll for tires, just to be surprised.
I asked myself: I believe I saw 25x622 on the road.
is also available (presumably?) for Marathon Plus tires, but the major part is already wider.
this is a problem?
you would like me to drive you around in a car generally?
The Schwalbe-Seite looks absolutely perfect! Would you recommend the Durano DD?

! Hello everyone!
finally we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST this year!
> Unfortunately, it's not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which means a higher planning cost and a shorter announcement time.
: ABER: At least three people will be there per show, so we can watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 bucks in the stream and publicly follow you!:
We tried our best to solve Delay's or other problems.
But hey, it's after the pandemic - so we're going to give everything we have to make the Oscars as close to normal as possible.
will be about 0:30.
you already drank too much, planted a good meal and made you ready for a long, but very interesting night.
