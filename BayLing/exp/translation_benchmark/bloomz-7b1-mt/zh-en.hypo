There is a way to punish him.
I don't want to see this happen again.
Or how long will the restaurant be ready? Could you ask them?


These achievements are mainly made by students, research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities, education, etc., and the students start from an interesting idea, create many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won prizes at home and abroad.
The bio-sensor: Your family doctor.
team of Dr. Zhang Di-ming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a bio-sensor on a smartphone, which is half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to take a deep breath, and this device can detect your health condition from your exhaled gas.
Zhang Di-ming introduced that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone when the user exhales.
able to detect health conditions through smart bracelets, usually measuring physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
This bio-sensor uses a new material, graphene, which is a new material. Its target is a chemical element, its "sniff" is very sensitive, and it can more deeply and accurately reflect the health condition.
The intelligent surgery lamp: the doctor's powerful eyes.
surgery rooms are also using smart lights.
invention won silver medal at the 44th International Inventor's Fair in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Master's students from the School of Optics and Photonics, Fudan University, Zhu Linqi and Sun Junfei teamed up to find a new way to the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights, and invented the intelligent LED surgical light.
Many diseases are detected and removed too late because of the light in the operating room.
said that, for example, if a doctor can't see all the tumor tissue in the early stage of cancer, then the cancer cells will spread.
surgical light with four light sources, through adjusting the spectrum, to enhance the difference of different tissues under the light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and the dark field of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
surgery light with intelligent control has already been used in the affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School, Zhejiang University Children's Hospital, etc., and has received good feedback.
, Last October, this invention won the first prize in the national challenge cup.
! Wash your hands with air: eco-friendly and cool!
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, and only rub soap and squeeze hand sanitizer, while Lee Kee-chang and his classmates invented an "air handwashing device".
the weight of our bodies can compress the air.
like a pump.
compressed air forms a fluid at the tap, and mixes with water.
," So we can wash our hands."
tests showed that the method of handwashing by using this product is as effective as the conventional method.
This device only needs our own gravity as the driving force, which can guarantee the washing effect, and save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely without energy consumption, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
, Last year, this invention won the gold medal at the second Global Challenges Summit, held at the world's top universities.

A very meaningful certificate - a first aid certificate.
is one of the most important skills certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Let's get this out of the way. Emergency care is actually the pre-hospital emergency care, the care given before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that the time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance was actually quite long, and that was the most crucial time.
is the time for emergency.
if I really had a heart attack, a stroke, a cardiac arrest, then our window of life would be only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
, So it's so important to know how to perform CPR!
When someone is in trouble, we can use our professional knowledge to help them, rather than just standing there and doing nothing, which is just so depressing.
in China, we have about three hundred million accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is called cardiac arrest.
15% of the people in the United States can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos, 70% to 80% can be saved, Shanghai and Beijing below 1%."
, This is what the founder of the first reaction said.
CPR is useless if the person has a cardiac arrest and no breath, no heartbeat.
CPR and chest compressions are necessary to save a person.
I found that we are still few people who have this awareness to learn the first aid, but it's too late when the accident happens, so I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react to the emergency situation timely.
might save a life!
you can register for the CPR certificate at the Red Cross training center in your local area. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and the students get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a list of goals I want to accomplish before I turn 25. I added the CPR certificate to the list months ago, but I did it!
Then I have to go and take the other certificates that I want to take, and I want to take a diving certificate, before I saw on reddit that there was also a diving emergency certificate, so that the diving emergency certificate is still useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#.
Only one of the 13 yuan's dumplings!
Don't try.
doesn't #NAME# write clearly?
cost 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# forgot to deliver the food, so this time only one dumplings for me!
Because I saw the code was valid before I typed it.
, First of all, I think that the film, The Four Seas, is a complete mess, in all senses of the word.
, But you don't have to say that the movie is a total flop, at least the score is good.
The worst movies are all kinds of crap, the ones that make you fall asleep in the cinema, the ones that make you mad, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones that make you want to punch the screen, the ones
is really talented in insulting the audience.
This movie is the most painful thing because it seems like a creation of the K-series, unrecognizable, and full of holes like the jacket of the K-series.
even after you have seen it, you'll be suspicious of the director's hidden metaphor, but after you think about it, you'll find it is just a pile of shit.
, Let's start with some of the things I find difficult to understand.
's home should be somewhere in the southern part of the island, living with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot was set up so that one elderly man drove a small van to take her to the north to see snow.
old man sitting in a car from the south to the north to see the snow?
and his father are still very confident.
the old man then went into silence.
how did the owner of the derelict ship get a business license?
Why is the motorcycle gang on the island able to easily block a roadway?
Then a truck carrying reinforcing bars stopped in the middle of the road, and nobody could find the driver.
is this too obvious a prop?
why would a low-life, a car thief, a criminal, and a felon become a police officer?
why didn't you call the police when you were in debt? Why didn't you call the police when you were in debt?
A grown-up knows how to use a smart phone, but doesn't know how to use a hotel key card to open the door and then forcefully sleep in the hotel's lobby?
strange plot lines run through the entire movie, so much so that I find myself suffering from pain when I recall them.
apart from the plot, the worst thing about the movie is the theme, or that the movie has no theme at all, but a hideous sewing machine.
The movie starts out as if he wanted to make a comedy, but then you think maybe it's an inspirational movie, then you think maybe it's a movie about the struggles of a young man in a small town, then you think maybe it's a movie about the difficulties of going to the movies on a holiday, and then you think maybe it's a movie about the difficulties of going to the bathroom.
For most people, it's actually pretty familiar with the movie genre tropes, like if you want to make a motorcycle movie, then you need to be inspirational and comedy and tell the audience a rookie's journey to success.
If you want to make a love movie, then tell the story of the love between a motorcycle enthusiast and a waitress.
you have to make sure that your story doesn't contradict the real world.
You can't go on a ride with a motorcycle that was just burned down and can still sing.
, As for the main character, who is not stupid, but acts like a five-year-old child in some ways, I don't know if it's the acting or the director's request.
is there something I don't understand about how Han Kuan is so interested in adding car crash scenes to his own movies.
such movies are put in the Spring Festival line-up, is it to annoy the audience?

South African doctor: Mkhuze's contagiousness is high, but most of the cases are mild.
South African doctors and medical experts believe that the mystery strain of the coronavirus is less severe than the delta strain, although it is more contagious.
According to the AFP news agency, as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads in South Africa, the South African town of Harare has reported that its five thousand doctors have formed a medical organization and said that they are treating the new coronavirus patients with mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing, similar to those of the flu.
's director, Dr. Anben Pillay, said that he sees about a dozen patients a day, but no one has yet been admitted to hospital.
said Philippe: "They can control the disease at home, most people recover within 10 to 14 days."
, He said that this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill with the coronavirus infection.
” He said that compared to the previous Delta wave, the number of patients he treated with the new coronavirus were "short of breath and low on oxygen."
many people will be admitted to hospital within a few days."
, Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
's observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases: In the last few weeks, the number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 has fallen by half, to 30% of those with severe symptoms, the average length of stay has been cut from 8 days to 2.8 days, and the number of deaths has fallen to 3%, compared to 20% in the early cases of the virus in South Africa.
William Hanekom, the director of the African Health Research Institute, quoted the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all the signs point to a mild disease."
He added: "Now is too early to get the late data.
, “Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we entered this wave of the epidemic only two weeks ago.”
scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalizations, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Delta remains the major strain of the coronavirus, but the Omicron variant is spreading in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter.
officials reported that the new cases in the province of Hudson increased 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the variant of the Oremic strain accounted for 90% of the cases.

Education commentary: What do we need to do to save abducted children?
If we can compare the famous public service ad slogan "No sale, no kill" with the saying "No buy, no sell", then in a good environment without the demand for kidnapping, the community prevention and the anti-kidnapping campaign will make kidnapping a risky, expensive and inefficient crime.
, Recently, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security developed a child missing information emergency reporting platform.
is a website established to establish a reliable channel for the publication of information on missing children and to find them quickly.
hearing the app named "团圆" , I felt warm.
New technology is not only named "art" and full of feelings, but also uses information technology appropriately, practical and effective.
to find the abducted child, protect the child's safety and freedom.
is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
punishments have a great meaning from individual punishment to social prevention to legal education.
, But before the case against the traffickers is solved, the victim's safety should be the priority.
It is a matter of weighing the pros and cons of various issues, and controversial issues such as whether child trafficking should be treated as a capital offense can be put aside for discussion, but the issue of rescuing abducted children cannot be put off.
cases of child abduction are handled on a case-by-case basis, and the abductors are often seen to leave the scene quickly after the abduction.
the minute the police are delayed in their search for the missing child, the child is one step closer to being lost forever.
In this case, the use of such a direct and effective tool as the "Union" platform to solve the case, to find the child, is indeed practical.
, In the end, “child trafficking” is a big task that needs to be done by the whole legal system.
To combat crime, protect children and parents' rights, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, and from the strict enforcement of law, all of these require the care of the weak and the weak-minded.
, In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from the family to society.
A common case, a family of three resting at the station, parents sleeping, and when they wake up, their child is gone.
two-year-olds cannot be expected to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, at least we should have some awareness of self-protection.
parents should take turns to rest or put the child in a safe place.
the other side of the police's efforts to combat child trafficking, the buyer side of the child trafficking market should also be looked into and punished.
behavior that is illegal in itself is often only a small part of a larger chain of illegal behavior.
According to the law of my country, the minimum sentence for kidnapping a child is five years, and the maximum sentence is death, with confiscation of property.
The minimum sentence is high, the maximum sentence is heavy, in the trend of "lightening" of criminal punishment, the crime of kidnapping children is obviously a serious crime.
still, there are many cases of child trafficking every year.
, It is clear that some people are backward in their ideas about child rearing and lack legal awareness.
education should be given to this group in the same way.
effective control of the crime of child trafficking cannot be achieved by strictly enforcing the law.
If the market for child trafficking is widespread, the traffickers will be motivated by greed and will constantly develop new methods of trafficking, creating a battlefield with the law enforcement agencies, and the fight against child trafficking will be ineffective.
, Therefore, to break the old ideas, to popularize the knowledge of law, also helps to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.
Yanhong Yang made a speech on the Communist Party of China (CPC) 19th National Congress and the Guangdong Communist Party Congress at the Manjiahan.
The party has learned from its 100-year struggle.

杨浩东 explained the essence and requirements of the three aspects of the meeting in a clear, concise, and comprehensive manner.
he pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the conference with the spirit of the important speech by the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Xi Jinping, and the spirit of the provincial party conference, to study the spirit of the conference, to integrate and apply it, to strengthen the sense of the " two establishing " , the sense of the " two guarding " , the sense of the " leading " by Xi Jinping, and to go on the way of the " leading " by Xi Jinping.
In the interactive discussion session, the grassroots leaders, the business leaders, and the youth leaders asked questions about the relationship between the three historic resolutions, how to understand the importance of the two decisive decisions, how to grasp the direction of the cultural enterprises, and how to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the centenary of the Communist Party of China. Yang Hodong answered the questions in a simple way, with vivid examples, and he urged the young Communist Party members to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the centenary of the Communist Party of China.

The first pressing olive oil or called natural olive oil is obtained from fresh olives by mechanical cold pressing, followed by filtration to remove impurities.
There are three grades depending on the acidity.

is delicious, with a pleasant, vegetal aroma, and a low acidity of less than 1%.
Virgin olive oil: slightly acidic, not more than 2%, and with a pleasant, aromatic taste.
: The ordinary virgin olive oil: It has a good taste and aroma, but its acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Extra virgin olive oil is the oil obtained from the first pressing of olives, or "extra virgin oil", when the acidity is over 3.3%.
and olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular olive oil: This oil is a mixture of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil, to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a golden yellow color.

, You should know that olives are like grapes in that they come from different regions and different olive varieties, and that different olive oil standards are produced.
The best place for olive trees is in the Mediterranean.

from March to June, the olive trees bloom and bear fruit, from July to October the fruit develops and matures, from green to red, purple, and finally black.
to November to February is the harvesting season for fruit (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Olive oil contains a lot of nutritional value.

olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition.

The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, also spoke at the opening ceremony and said that the digital revolution is challenging democracy around the world, especially in developing countries.
"It is time to reaffirm our common values and positions, and the resilience of democracy.
This requires a deepening of social dialogue, the solution of inequality problems, the fight against corruption, the renewal of the social contract, the investment in quality education, and the widening of women's opportunities.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution . "
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong made a pre-recorded video statement at the summit, reminding participants to continue to monitor the human rights situation in Hong Kong and other Chinese ethnic minorities, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.

Have already taken a picture and uploaded it to you.
. I know.
The restaurant keeps on delaying the delivery time.
minutes to get to the station Now it takes #NUMBER# minutes to get to the station.
I won't call anyway.
Don't eat.
I'll definitely complain.
You can't deliver, why didn't you tell me sooner?
You waited so long.
I didn't get a call.
Please inform him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait another #MINUTES#.
A meal took an hour and a half to get here.
The order has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why don't you cancel?
You have a delivery of hot pot here.
want to try tennis, but afraid of not being able to keep up, so want to start with something that is not too expensive.
, In fact, prices are often proportional to the friendliness, if you can't tell, then the normal price is usually more friendly than the cheap one, these "entry-level" products are actually industrial garbage.
are weak, and the ball hitting the racket makes a great sound, and the hard ball can't stand it, and the great players can't control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn, and you know you won't buy a high-end racket, so you get a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice, and then you won't want to play anymore, so the racket is cheap, and you don't feel bad about it.
you will know good from bad when you really can, then come back to me and buy expensive, I will make twice the money.
Suggest you buy a used good racket for the same price as a new one, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket won't fetch much, a new one will cost you around 500 or 600, a used one will cost you around 200, so you get the same pleasure as if you had a thousand-dollar racket.
is friendly to newbies, but after the newbie stage it becomes a piece of junk, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the newbie stage.
Orders have been repeatedly delayed in delivery time.
can you help me follow up?
The postponement.
Thank you.
, Well, I mean, I already have a credit card?
Will I need to order again? The first order didn't need to be taken into account, did it?
The food ordered from this restaurant was delivered, but there were many missing items, and the chicken was also raw.
Please cancel the order.

A girl raised money for her sister by shooting arrows at her. "When I think of the pain, I feel better." - Xinhua
a girl standing in front of a large board with the words "Man's meat, ten yuan a shot" written on it in Hangzhou, Zhejiang.
morning, a photo of a young girl in Hangzhou who volunteered to be a target for her sister's fundraising went viral on Weibo.
photos show a girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "Man's meat, ten yuan a shot" written on it, indicating that people can shoot arrows at her for ten yuan.
behavior caused a stir among netizens.
Last night, the spokesman for the Hangzhou police district confirmed to the New York Times that the police had confirmed the girl's identity in order to raise money for her sister, but this was a regrettable action, and the girl left the police station yesterday after being warned.
The girl was warned off the street by a man who was collecting money for a target.
The image on the internet shows a girl with long hair standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "Man's meat, ten yuan a bullet" written on it, and her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account number written on another board.
the picture was posted on the Internet and caused controversy.
commentators thought the act was a "publicity stunt", and many commentators expressed sympathy.
We were on patrol around the square at about 10 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd when we saw the crowd.
the police station in the vicinity of the incident said that the two girls who were selling flowers were both 20 years old and looked very pretty.
One girl was crying, begging passersby to play the game; the other girl was yelling, begging for help for her friend's sister, who had leukemia, and needed a surgery, and so on.
we contacted the local police in Zhejiang and learned that the girl was collecting money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
night ago, the spokesman of the Hangzhou police district told the New Beijing News that the girl named Jia Jia Li was the sister of Jia Jia Yan and raised money for her.
But, since treatment still requires 30,000 yuan, it was not easy to find a good way to raise money, so he did that.
He said that two girls were targets and one girl was a helper, but they didn't participate in the shooting, and no one saw anyone shoot a bow and arrow, just people watching and taking pictures and posting them on Weibo.
the police used the bow in question after the department of public safety had examined it.
official said, " We don't encourage this kind of fundraising."
, After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

what is the most popular in 2021?
is the Tokyo Olympics.
you think only Olympic athletes can win medals?
A few weeks ago, a very popular article appeared, "Quick! Project Managers Can Win Olympic Gold in the Olympic Games", which mentioned that project managers can be the first to go in many projects, no one can match them: They are constantly working on the construction site, traveling, working late, and even taking the blame and apologizing.
seems like a joke, but it also reflects the daily hardships of project managers, who are struggling with the current state of project management.
, And project managers began to choose some actions to get rid of their work problems.
the number of people who have taken the PMP (the international certification for project management professionals) exam has been steadily increasing, and more and more people are taking courses to improve their project management skills.
According to the China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of people who have taken the PMP® exam in China is about 60,000, and the number of people who have passed the exam is about 42,000, with about 30,000 people holding the PMP® certification, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certified people in the world.
PMP certification has increased steadily over the past 10 years, which indicates that more and more project managers are realizing that it is no longer enough to simply "copy and paste" the old ways of doing things, but that we need to learn from the great scientists and explore the path forward by standing on their shoulders.
, However, having a PMP certificate will guarantee smooth project management?
project management beginners often express that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically grasp the ten areas and five process groups of project management, but when they actually work on projects, they are still in a state of confusion.

Therefore, having been involved in the product innovation and management of R&D for more than ten years, we have helped many excellent companies to train a large number of product managers, project managers, etc., and have received the "Huaxia Huaxia Training Center for R&D Management" and other honors. So, today, we bring you the online course "R&D Project Manager Training Course".
online course
is also an opportunity for the enterprise to use lower costs and less investment to promote the managerial training process, to bring about the efficient operation results for the enterprise.
can you see how other students rate this course? This course is not only taught by the experts from Huawei's Center of Excellence (formerly the Project Management Team of Huawei) but also by the international advanced project management method and the real-life business scenarios from many well-known companies.
It will also provide scientifically practical management tools and methods, rich templates, forms, and help students to apply the learning content to their work after class.

Vietnamese People's Daily Online - The Gulf Cooperation Council in the Face of Common Challenges
's visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) included Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
's visit to Qatar is noteworthy, as it is the first visit by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and his Arab allies to Qatar since 2017, when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar, which led to the Gulf crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, and accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while having close ties with Iran.
diplomatic tension seriously affected the unity of the Arab League, which had a negative impact on the region's economies.
four Arab states blocked the air, land, and sea routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement aimed at "unity and stability" brokered by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its borders with Qatar.
Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf states have resolved their differences and restored relations with Qatar in order to meet the common interests and regional stability, and to face the common challenges.
, During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Sultanate of Oman, the two countries agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
725 km long corridor will provide convenient conditions for citizens of both countries to travel and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in Oman, and the two countries signed 13 MOU worth $300 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between the world's major powers and Iran to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal the Gulf states condemned because they believed it could not solve the Iran's missile issue.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and have viewed Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
countries of the Gulf believe that not solving the Iranian missile problem and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is a defect.
, In the context of the failure of the negotiations between the major powers and Iran on the nuclear issue, Saudi Arabia held direct negotiations with Iran.
's goal is to prevent the escalation of the regional tensions.
is one of the factors that has slowed down the growth of the GCC countries.
The forthcoming summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council since some of its members have resolved their dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity to review the achievements of the GCC in promoting the return to the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while presenting measures to its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf states.

team has brought you this car, which is the dream of many men!
torino is the Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
price of the car is about two million Malaysian ringgits, the annual road tax is about 17,000 Malaysian ringgits, four-wheel drive, why call it LP700?
700 horsepower is a lot of power, isn't it?
Well, I don't know, the data says 0-100km/h acceleration takes 2.9 seconds, which is about the time myvi takes to reach 30km/h, and then it accelerates to 100km/h.
The low, wide body, the aggressive coupe, the huge intake on the front and the glass-enclosed 6.5-liter V12 engine perfectly define the style of Lamborghini.
For the car model, you don't need to say much, just Google it, and we have some Google can't give you answers!
is too much attention, to go anywhere, everyone is looking at you, it's uncomfortable!
1km petrol costs around RM1 (the owner doesn't care).
Practice your getting off and getting on, or you'll be a little embarrassed (because you'll get stuck in the car and half of you won't get out)
engine noise is too loud, so you'll be deaf after you get off the bus.
The car is too big to park in a normal parking spot, so it will be narrow and afraid of being hit by the car next door when it opens the door!
is lonely because there are no rivals on the road.
everyone, don't get me wrong, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!

The spirit of university should be in sync with the spirit of the times.
university spirit is the long-standing accumulation of a university's educational ideas and values, the soul of the university.
spirit of the university has been and remains a vital factor in the development of politics, economics, culture, science, society, and the nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has been called upon to fulfill a unique mission that is different from other social organizations, for our university, which arose in the time of national crisis, has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the times, and has advocated the value concept of "honesty and benevolence for the world," and the patriotic duty of "strengthening the country."
， The current trend of higher education is to become more internationalized and informationized, and global competition for education, technology, and talent is becoming increasingly fierce. Higher education is an important "input side" in the education system, and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
, Especially the proposal of the General Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Top-Level Disciplines, which shows the confidence and determination of China to move from a country with a large number of universities to a country with a large number of universities, also presents a higher and more demanding demand for the development of universities.
How can we accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, and achieve the goal of "going straight"?
In addition to confidence in the goal, the path, and the ability, universities should fully exploit their three advantages: first, the advantage of being late, through the continuous attraction of overseas excellent academic talents, the study of the world's best universities' advanced experiences, and the achievement of significant improvement in academic level and teaching quality; second, the advantage of culture, through the inheritance of the Chinese civilization in the five thousand years of accumulation of wisdom, the promotion of the development of the excellent traditional culture, and the gathering of the power, the brand, and the image; third, the advantage of the system, through the application of the country's
, It is especially important to realize that building a world-class university is not possible to do in a uniform way, and that each school must show its own personality and characteristics.
school's distinctive features should be both Chinese in character and reflect its unique goals, traditions and resources.
for Zhejiang University, we have emphasized the three aspects of its distinctive features: one is to highlight the innovation and entrepreneurship education, to form a symbiotic environment of education and industry, to create a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; two is to highlight the cross-fertilization of disciplines, to form a favorable environment of cross-fertilization of disciplines, to cultivate new interdisciplinary fields and the leading interdisciplinary achievements; three is to highlight the system of education and service, to conduct deep international exchanges and cooperation, to form a network of cooperation of Zhejiang University.
, In this process, especially, it is important to always keep the spirit of the university, and to make the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
for Zhejiang University, the motto of “求是创新” , the values of “勤学、修德、明辨、笃实” , and the concept of “海纳江河、启真厚德、开物前民、树我邦国” form the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
is a key factor in the school's successful development of the correct direction and the accumulation of cultural height and the gathering of spiritual power. It is full of meaning and profound.

series of spiritual ideas and values are the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
the wise hear in the silence, the clear see in the darkness.
China's universities should further take the lead in the construction of the socialist cause in China, grasp the position of the university in the contemporary era and the historical mission, and strive to become world-class universities.
At the same time, to uphold the spirit of humanity and independence, and to make the university spirit touch the spirit of the times, the national spirit, the national soul, so as to provide a constant impetus for the country to be rich and strong and the nation to be reborn, and for the human common ideal to be realized, it is necessary to make the university spirit touch the spirit of the times, the national spirit, the national soul.

NFTs have been making waves in the crypto community, and now there's a new concept popping up.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity," which was released in the Asian region, had a huge impact on the local economy. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn steady income in the game.
Infinity is a blockchain-based pet养成 game that combines NFTs with other modes, currently the highest trading NFT project, with over $30 billion in trading volume as of now.
Axie Infinity's daily income surpassed $820,000, and is close to the number of players of the popular game《王者荣耀》.
, On August 6th, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded one million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity has led to a new "palytoearn" mode, which is being passed on to more people through blockchain and smart contracts, as players are no longer just a single character, but can also enjoy the game and make money while participating in the game's ecosystem.
ty of this subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but is guaranteed by the blockchain technology.
I have the biggest impression from the news about the stock of my friend is that the company's choice of the industry, which is the investment target, is to choose the industry with the biggest growth space, at least 1,000 billion market capitalization; secondly, to choose the industry with the best growth potential, considering the industry's growth potential to reach its best state in the next 3-5 years; thirdly, to choose the industry with the policy support.
refers to market size, refers to industry's development stage, refers to industry's competitive landscape.
the right way!
the first thing to do in the new year is to review 2021 and plan for 2022.
is the art of doing things right.
is strategy about "doing the right thing", or doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding the direction, tactics are about getting there, and in most tactical thinking there is room for strategic thinking.

Asian American groups are complaining about Yale, Princeton, and Harvard's admissions practices.
The United States Department of Education and the Department of Justice were notified of the complaint on Wednesday by the United States 130-plus Asian-American organizations.
the Asian-American Education Alliance held a press conference in Washington on the same day that it launched its lawsuit.
's president, Zhao Yuxuan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who qualified for US colleges and universities has increased by more than tenfold in the past ten years, but that the proportion of Asian-Americans in these three top US colleges remains roughly the same.
many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian students in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process.
said that in 2014, the study by Sanders et al. showed that the Asian American enrollment rate in these three universities was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that the proportion of Asian students admitted to Brown University and Dartmouth College is the lowest among all the Ivy League schools, and that Yale University and Brown University have practiced racial quotas for Asian students for over 20 years.
told the New China News Agency that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to investigate and take action to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian students after they submit their complaints.
also expect the university to take the issue of affirmative action seriously and change its policy on Asian admissions.
the three universities have not yet responded to the complaint.
Asian-American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about Harvard University's admissions bias, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
, This time, besides the American Chinese groups, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education groups also participated in the protest.

September 2020, Mr. Lu learned of a factory in Zhaotong, Zhejiang, from a real estate agent. After visiting the factory several times, Mr. Lu decided to buy it.
December the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the family of the owner of the land, Mr. Lin, and transferred 20 million yuan as a deposit to the bank on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed the receipt for the deposit receipt on the purchase agreement, which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller, and the parties agreed to sign the purchase agreement within one week."
, However, the parties could not agree on the main contract terms, such as the sale range, the payment method, etc., which resulted in the delay of the house purchase contract.
, After several days, Mr. Lin returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
先生, after paying the deposit and having the money ready, the house is ready to be signed, but the seller refuses to sell, which makes Mr. Lu angry and upset.
Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin in the Yixian District People's Court.
The court concluded that the parties could not agree on a formal contract, and that the failure to do so could not be solely attributed to the defendant, so that the case should not be governed by the penalty clause, and that the defendant should not be liable for double the amount of the deposit.
the plaintiff appealed the judgment.
, The court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
seller's agent should exercise due diligence in the course of the sale.
As a buyer, you should exercise due diligence, such as checking the ownership information of the house, the house's occupancy, and other relevant information, and clearly stipulating the time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to avoid any dispute when the contract is executed.

's summit is a step in Biden's fulfillment of his campaign promises.
two-day meeting was held via video link, with 111 heads of state invited, including Taiwan's, but China and Russia were not.
before the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democracy problems, saying that the United States had no right to host such a summit.
There were also voices of doubt in the international community and in the United States itself, such as the criticism of the invited leaders, including some with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who were questioned about the true intentions of the Biden administration, not for democracy but for geopolitical reasons, to organize the summit.
The new German Prime Minister, Schröder, also attended the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Saturday, saying that " today, the American-style democracy is sick, and the money politics, identity politics, party politics, polarization, social division, racial tension, wealth gap, and political extremism are all on the rise." The American democracy is based on capitalism, a game for the rich.
U.S. President Biden said, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protective walls of democracy, push for reform, and achieve transparent accountability, to better resist the forces of tyranny and the will of those who seek to pursue power at the expense of the public good."
he stressed that democracy is not an automatic process, "we must constantly renew it in each generation, to me this is the decisive challenge of our time."
, Biden said that global democracy and human rights "face continuing and troubling challenges," and that democracy needed "defenders to stand up for it."
the United States has promised to undertake a year-long action plan, which includes a $4.244 billion initiative, to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
hopes that all countries will make concrete public commitments before the 2022 deadline for the real democracy summit, to improve their democratic systems.
said Biden, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Well, I just don't know if he has the right address.

Education Thinking: How to make the best of the university exam for the "good students" and the "poor students" - Xinhua
Three students from Lanjia University of Technology wrote to the university's leaders, expressing their confusion about the university exam, and asking for a change in the exam difficulty and the type of questions asked, so that the exam would truly reflect the students' actual level.
, Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels, and with different levels of education. The situation is therefore very different.
a group with such a wide variety of features is bound to have different feelings about it.
, Of course, if the exam questions are simple, repetitive, and easy, the feeling will be quite different.
effortless students may pass the exam by studying hard before the exam, if they try other methods, they may achieve the effect of double the effort.
This way, there is a "poor student" who can pass the exam even though he doesn't pay attention and even gets high marks; and a "good student" who never misses class, who has good homework and good notes, and who doesn't get much higher marks in the exam.
seems that the students of the Lhasa University of Science and Technology have a good reason to complain about the university exams, and this is not the only university to have this problem.
to this extent, I applaud the three students for writing to me directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that the phenomenon of students studying for the exam by any means possible, trying to get the exam questions from the teacher, trying to get the exam syllabus, and asking for extra help from the teacher before the exam is not uncommon, and even in exams, students are allowed to take notes and ask for forgiveness after the exam.
as a quality assessment tool, measuring the passing rate of a university exam is more about the overall grasp of teachers on teaching and learning, and the scientificity of the exam questions.
into the university stage, the specialty began to be divided, and many specialty courses were based on the basic knowledge.
is a major part of the university entrance examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge, from the point of view of knowledge, the change is not big, and is basically fixed.
as one teacher said , " 20 years ago , you had to know the basics of university mathematics , and now you still have to know them , and they are still the most important . "
knowledge points are basically the same, but don't mean that the test is simple and the questions are the same.
In many universities, exams are usually formed into a group by the professors of the subject, and the composition of the exam papers is coordinated by the senior professors of the discipline, and the marking of the exam papers is also done by the teachers of the subject, so that the repetition of the exam papers can be somewhat overcome.
But to devise a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be distributed in a normal way, and the test questions should be combined with the overall situation of the students, the level of the students, and the situation of the teaching, and the situation of the students, and the situation of the teaching, and the situation of the students, and the situation of the teaching, and the situation of the students, and the situation of the teaching, and the situation of the students, and the situation of the teaching, and the situation of the students, and the situation of
exam is the key to the university education, with what kind of exam, students will have corresponding preparation plans, and this will affect the effect of university education.
letter of recommendation from the university of Lanzhou to the students has been given great attention by the school. A plan for improvement has been put in place in the school.
the teaching units to organize teachers to conduct research and compare the results of the course evaluation with the final exam, to formulate the exam papers and related regulations, and to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the exam papers and the review of the results of the evaluation, to make the grading more detailed, and to strengthen the overall evaluation of the course.
The issue of single and repeated questions in exams is a problem that university exam administration needs to face, of course, it needs to have the corresponding system, but the key is to practice daily, teachers need to know the whole situation of teaching, not just master the content, but also master the situation of students learning, both sides master, teaching and learning will be better matched, and the exam will be more in line with reality, so that the "good students" and the "poor students" can get along well.

The Sarawak National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies because of the exhaustion of the special paper used for the certificates. As of today, 3200 people have been affected.
, However, the chief of the department, Kerosamenus, assured us that all the babies who applied for birth certificates have their records in the system, and that the counterfeit paper will be delivered next week, so that they can be issued.
He gave an explanation for the long-standing issue of the printing of the Sabah Daily's newsprint, which was reported by a news website.
said that the problem had been there for two months, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
one of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of special-purpose counterfeit paper has been affected by the epidemic, which has delayed the delivery to my country.
explained that the counterfeit paper used in Sabah newspapers is different from that used in other states, so that it cannot be borrowed from other states.
, Keruammonus revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th, for partial printing.
The post office will send a delivery team to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and return to Sabah immediately to print the final stage, which will be completed in two working days (December 20th).
applicants will be notified to go to the local police stations to pick up their application forms.
, He added that Saba has issued 2,4801 college entrance exams so far this year.

YouTube video reveals the truth about the U.S. military's 20-year bloodshed in Afghanistan
Video source from YouTube.
, On December 11th, a video titled "Game of Thrones" on YouTube attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan War under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", through war forcing the export of American democracy, 20 years of bloodshed, savagery and murder, committing countless crimes against humanity.
Using drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, and then forming a killing squad, is a form of human rights abuse.
the U.S. has killed thousands of innocent Afghans for the past 20 years.
U.S. soldiers set up a "black hole" to torture and humiliate suspects.
atrocities against humanity have only increased the hatred of the Afghans.
as the video said, the war against terrorism in the U.S. is "going to go to war".
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, and hope to the people of Afghanistan, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video and let's expose the truth about the U.S.'s bloodthirsty, murderous, and hypocritical war on terror, and the U.S.'s fake democracy!
I happened to see the following article, from a business point of view and from the perspective of the preservation period, why this customer wanted the logistics company in the customs zone to do the canning, although canning is a deep processing, not in the scope of the customs logistics company's business, here is the text below that may explain why the customer wanted to do this.
I visited many factories that make baby milk powder, and I met many production lines.
and the powdered milk in the can and the powdered milk in the bottle are the same, no difference.
Everyone will ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged product one year, while the shelf life of the canned product is two years or longer?
or ask: Why are the prices of the cans and bags so different?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality is much better.
the same thing, but people think it's expensive so it's good.
consumers also have this attitude, after eating, they say that the taste or smell of the canned food is different!
Now I will tell you why the bottled water is so expensive. Where is the problem?
why are the prices so different?
Because manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, consumers will not accept it, so the manufacturer will have a low profit, or no profit, so how can the manufacturer survive?
, So they had a big increase in the price of the canned goods to protect their profit margin.
most manufacturers promote cans, not bags.
How come there are so many companies that spend millions of dollars or even billions of dollars every year on advertising?
is obvious to everyone.
So, as the society develops, the market promotion costs, such as the market promoters, the market displays, the product's gifts, the advertisements, etc., are also increasing.
so manufacturers are also constantly increasing new products, and they're all in cans, and the prices are constantly going up, and that's because of the cost of the market.
their main purpose is to get higher profits, and the actual cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There are still some brands, to promote their products, they don't care about anything, they link with the doctors in the hospital, they help them to promote their products, they take 30-80 yuan profit from each product.
Chinese law is absolutely against such a method of operation, in fact, this is a way of cheating consumers.
suggest that you buy the powdered milk in a bag, so that you can save money and increase the sealing and preservation of the milk, and that it will not affect the baby.
And don't think that the shelf life of the canned food is longer than the shelf life of the bagged food, if the shelf life of the canned food is the same as the shelf life of the bagged food, then the shelf life of the bagged food is longer, but it is more difficult to keep it dry and fresh.
The food was cold, dry, and hard, and it was impossible to eat.
The sauce spilled out.
. Cancel it right away, he will have sent it back to you by now.
I didn't take it!
The #NAME# said that no one went to get it.
We called there.
You won't get your money back if you don't pay up.
I have had the worst experience with #PRS_ORG# today.
I can't accept it at all.
Okay, then.
The restaurant and the driver should also be reminded.
Avoid the same mistake again.
I want to know the exact time of delivery.
That time is constantly delayed.
I don't know when it will be.
Can I get my money back if I cancel the order?
How do you pay the rider for the service?
A few hours ago, the driver was confirmed.

Don't scare people off at the starting line - Xinhua
bookstores are often full of self-help books.
The success books of today are full of the "greatest principles" — — that is , to assume or imply that you can "achieve" , and then tell you what you need to do "is" .
amounts to saying that you have already passed the most important and basic step, namely "How to do it."
This is why these books have a common feature — either do the best you can, or do nothing at all; either climb Mt. Everest, or just stay put.
"Rightness" is the best principle, and everyone will agree that it is "right on", but 99% of people will be scared off by the starting line.
theory advocates a path of "you're going to have to make a big change," and that's a big weakness for a lot of people.
to the man who is content to be a conformist, a conservative, and who refuses to change, you are going to shout at him, "Change!" - it's a self-serving, pointless thing to do.
Most people will be put off by the word "change", and will hesitate to make the decision to change, or will make a decision to change, and then take the first step, but often it is not long before they give up, and it is not long before they see the lack of continuity.
Mr. Ma Sili's famous sketch "The Day After Tomorrow" is the best example of this "common human nature".
the biggest problem with the best-practice principle is that the threshold is too high, often beyond the ability of most people, leaving most people "feeling frustrated".
, Perhaps the "good enough principle" is the only way to get more people on a path to relative success.
The core of the "good enough principle" is "less is more" — it encourages a theory of "less is more", that if you can't do 100, you can do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0, and if you can't climb Mt. Everest, you can climb your front yard's little hill, because that is always better than standing still.
or, in short, you are better off doing something than not doing anything.
the possibility of success for the average person has increased greatly, because the threshold has been lowered greatly.
is just a little longer than the path of success that follows the "good enough" principle.
In short, the best principle, though it pretends to be the one that makes everyone successful, can actually only inspire a few; the second-best principle, on the other hand, can inspire more people and do as much good as possible to as many people as possible.
Would I need to order a new one now?
The telephone is unanswered.
It's been a constant delay.
It hasn't been delivered yet.
May I know when will the delivery be made?
how can I contact you?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He has two meals left to deliver, but one order has already been completed.
How do I contact the rider?
me a ride. The first rider told me that there would be another rider to give me a ride.
The amount of the Qinghai Lake裸鲤 resources has increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
The Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11, reports (Reporter: Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongcai): According to the results of the latest monitoring of the Qinghai Lake裸鲤, the resource stock of the Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has increased by 0.71 million tons to 10.85 million tons this year, compared with 2002, when the protection started, and has increased by 40 times.
toadfish, also known as the "yangtze carp", is a rare species of fish in the Qinghai Lake, which is of great importance to the maintenance of the ecological balance of the Qinghai Lake basin and the biodiversity.
， In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the large-scale human killing, the deterioration of the breeding environment, and the decline of the number of the Qinghai Lake裸鲤, the resource of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 in 2002 was only 2592 tons.
2004, the Qinghai Lake裸鲤 was listed as endangered species in the Chinese species red list.
2003, the People's Republic of China began to implement the closure of the Lake Qinghai and the prohibition of fishing for the Lake Qinghai's main rivers and tributaries, as well as the sale of the Lake Qinghai's trout and its products.
at the same time, through the artificial reproduction release and the cleaning of the main inflow rivers of the Qinghai Lake, the design of the scientifically reasonable "passage for fish", etc., the Qinghai Lake's裸鲤 resource has been steadily increasing.
The deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Gansu province, Yang Lin, said that by now, the Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has been released into the lake over 1.8 billion times, contributing over 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake's裸鲤 resources.
The Three Gorges region in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source area for China and Asia, while the Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and water source area for the west against the spread of desertification.
the last few months, the People's Republic of China has issued a series of notices to protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges area and the Qinghai Lake, to protect the aquatic wildlife, to maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, and to protect the water resources.
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to order food over $180.
But the order didn't take off $20.

information provided by software, if there is any error, the information is correct, please don't buy if you are not satisfied!
any questions, please contact the online customer service.
I only want one bag, please put it in the bag and bring it to the restaurant. It's cold outside.
, Would you like to know if the food is in a bag?
We only saw a bag.
for the question. Thanks for asking. If you want to know if we sent it out or if someone took it, thanks for asking.
It's been an hour and they haven't delivered yet.
just saw a post about the menstrual cycle, it was too long.
to explain something to a man who doesn't know.
most girls experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and their last period around the age of 50.
I will come every month if I am healthy.
isn't very regular, and can be predicted with a week's margin, needs to be prepared in advance, sometimes bad luck can also cause a crash (suddenly a few days earlier).
The length of time, blood loss, and pain varies from person to person, some people have it for three days, some for a week; some people have little blood loss, some have a massive hemorrhage; some people have no reaction, some people are in pain so much they have to get an ambulance, and the pain varies with time, it used to be no pain doesn't mean it will never be.
period is uncontrollable, and starts to end, during which time you bleed for 24 hours straight, you can only do so by using a pad or tampon to suck the blood out so that it doesn't spill onto your clothes or chair.
The main cause of menstrual pain is the production of prostaglandins, so taking ibuprofen as soon as the pain starts can help relieve the pain for the month, after which it won't help.
before menstruation, due to the increased blood flow and the excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to suffer from diarrhea.
if you are having irregular periods, you will probably have your period within two days.
The sanitary pads should be changed every two or three hours, otherwise they will be prone to bacteria, and the worst case is that you should change them six times a day, for seven days a month, which is 42 pads, if you add up the pre-prepared ones, it may be 50 pads, not one pad for every month.
(Here is a modification: tampons don't need to be changed often, maybe 5-6 hours once, and the longest is 8 hours.)
hormones can make you more moody during your period, and your body can be a little unpredictable during your ovulation, so it's just a bad thing, your body is playing tricks on you.
official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control their emotions, and do not use it as an excuse for emotional problems.
not only blood is shed, but also the shed uterine lining.
The endometrium is the thinnest after the menstrual period, then thickens, which can be interpreted as the uterus being a house, which is built (the endometrium thickens) every month to prepare for the guests, the guests not coming, all the houses are demolished (the menstrual blood is discharged) the next month to build a new house, and so on.
is very inconvenient, for years and years, every month for days and hours, and then you have to suffer from cramps and pain in your back, who wants to?
But people are born because their mothers have had their period, and the period is for the purpose of preparing a house for you to live in for the first 10 months of your life, so everyone should thank their mother for having a healthy and regular period.
things were suppressed for women, society made them think that they were dirty, shameful, and that was that, but times have changed.
If anyone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the body of a woman is prepared for the birth of a child in a disgusting way, that they shouldn't say this in public, girls, stand up and don't think like this, men, don't be so ungrateful and unkind, this attitude is not worthy of your mother, not worthy of having a child.
, At last, sisters, try tampons, they really work.
Today is the Day of the Midnight Sun, so a mistake is a big disappointment.
You have to order a separate meal for the little boy.
Hope the shopkeeper will check the quality of the goods on a daily basis.
foot baths make your feet numb is it because of the electricity?
foot bath is a good way to relieve fatigue and stress. Today, the author of this article will answer the question about choosing the right foot bath.
With people's health awareness increasing, the popularity of foot baths is increasing, and there are a variety of products on the market, from one hundred and eighty yuan to one thousand yuan, which gives consumers a lot of choice.
-shaped products, such as foot baths, are selling well, but there is no industry standard for them, so there is a safety risk.
tooting the water in the electric water bath is too dangerous!
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but his father found the bath water too hot to bathe in.
Mr. Li thought the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause of his father's discomfort, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li used the electric pencil to test the water in the bath, and the pencil lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bath had electricity.
later he contacted the merchant, the merchant was kind enough, although he had to cancel the bath, Mr. Li still felt upset.
Because he found out that this popular foot bath has no clear and detailed industry standards for the following factors: the highest temperature setting, the applicable population, the material used to ensure safety.
, But generally speaking, the electric foot baths are unlikely to have electrical problems, but there are a few products that may not have been strictly tested at the factory.
, So, when buying a foot bath, choose a split bath.
water and electricity are separated, there is no safety risk.
you can also use a flashlight to test.

You order the food to be brought up.
I just don't want to go out and buy things, so I spent so much money on a take-out.
, Dear Mr. Ding,
I sincerely thank all my friends for the kind assistance they have given us for the past 30 years, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends around the world in January 1994.
most of the bereaved parents have passed away, and the orphaned children have grown up and found jobs.
your selflessness helped us through the most difficult time.
the coronavirus pandemic is raging across the world, and most of the donors are elderly.
Therefore, I implore you to stop giving us the donations for the mothers of Tiananmen Square, which should have been completed long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and I am sure that your deed will be remembered in history.
my only way of expressing my wishes is to do so in this way, please forgive me!
accept my sincere greetings.
The pottery industry's note: Allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the history of the United States-China Friendship Society (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF) in the United States.
and the United States Student Alliance and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations working in the humanitarian aid field. The project implementers often cross each other.
Apple Daily (@AppleDaily) June 1, 2015
often the relief money cannot reach the victims of the Tiananmen Square.
1994, after the suggestion of Ding, a special group was formed by "Mother Tiananmen" to receive and distribute humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Huai'an Children Fund for Education", which was in operation for eleven years. In 2009, all the Huai'an children who had graduated from college were provided with financial assistance, and the fund was in operation until today.
's funding comes mainly from the donations of the students and the society in the late sixties, from the individual donations, and from the support of the Brother University Democracy Fund.
, Since 2018, it has also received support from the Prison Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the relatives of the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre finally received a portion of the money raised by the Hong Kong people in memory of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
period, the China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called off the donation for the Tiananmen massacre, in order to protect the donors, and we are indeed retired people, with no more income than before retirement, so we are very grateful to Mr. Ding for his letter to his "friends."
will respect the decision of the bereaved, and terminate the project within two years, and restore it when necessary.
thanks and respect to those who have been generous and brave enough to risk their lives to deliver aid to those in need.

The lid of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, so do not put any solvents that react with PC in it.
do not use the syringe to inject the sample directly into the chip, otherwise it is easy to cause the sample to leak.
chips with a common base were tested for purity at 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) inlet pressure.
The glass substrate chips are tested for purity at 800mbar (100um channel) before shipment, and you should be careful not to hit the sharp objects while using the glass substrate chips, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
use the solution carefully, and do not exceed this range, otherwise it may cause leakage.
The recommended flow rates for the microchip with a flat base are below 150ul/min for the use of pure water in the syringe pump and below 50ul/min for the oil phase.
Please consider the actual viscosity of the sample liquid when you increase the flow rate.
clean the channel thoroughly after the experiment, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
chips are disposable items, and cannot be used repeatedly.

how do I pay?
The same meal has already been delivered.
There is no rider to receive.
I got a call from the restaurant manager.
wants to share his personal experience with programming.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a training place to get trained, but if you don't have any plans to do so, then you should probably study by yourself, since the training cost a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
, But if you are planning to get into this industry, training is a great choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a great choice.
can also choose to study by oneself, but it will be more tiring.
choosing a good training institution is an important matter.
, First of all, we should look at the teaching staff of this institution, if the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning, of course, some new training institutions have not strong teaching staff.
Second, before choosing, you should do some research on the training institution, and you should also do some research on the students who come out of the institution, because only the students who come out of the institution know what the institution is like, whether the course is good or bad.
, Hello, actually your question I don't know how to answer, because you didn't give me enough information about yourself, and learning something is related to your personal situation.
, For example, the field, age, the language you want to learn, even the city, all of these will be related to your study or the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated, or a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I would personally recommend self-study, which is the cheapest and most efficient way, now there are many offline and online training institutions, but the cost is high, the time is long, and it needs to be concentrated training for 3 to 6 months.
But if I were to say these conditions, self-study would be very convenient, now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to B站 and find many training resources, if you don't know how to find resources, you can contact me through the introduction and get free resources, or you can ask me for detailed information.
there are also some other books that can be combined with the video to study.
If you aren't a computer science major, but can afford the time and money costs of studying, then it is recommended to go to a training institute, so that studying is not too difficult, the teacher explains it very clearly, there are people who answer questions, and there is also help with planning and monitoring.
and now many training institutions will sign employment contracts, have internship opportunities, and recommend students to companies, so that the interview process for finding a job can be saved a lot of work.

China and Saudi Arabia jointly organize the first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua
The Saudi Press Agency, Riyadh, December 12, 2011 (Reporter: Wang Haitao and Hu Gao) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia, the Darayya contemporary art biennale, was officially opened to the public on November 11 at the Darayya JAX art district in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries.
's exhibition is curated by the Saudi Darayya Foundation and the UCCA, and is curated by the UCCA's director, Tian Yu.
curatorial team presented the biennial as a theme of "摸着石头过河", a metaphor for the economic transition period that was adopted by the government to reflect the current situation of the Saudi society and culture.
The biennial exhibition occupies nearly 12000 square meters, and is spread across six connected buildings, with six sections: 《 摸着石头过河 》 《 传承作为实验 》 《 边缘思考 》 《 走向公众 》 《 美丽新世界》以及《论艺术的精神 》 .
Among the 27 Saudi artists whose works made up 40% of the total number of items on display, there were paintings, installations, and performance art, among others; 12 Chinese artists were also well represented, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in his 2014 work "Story Behind the Story Series: The endless mountain stream" ("溪山无尽图"), which recreated a classic landscape painting using recycled materials.
The chief executive of the Diliye Foundation, Barclay, hopes that this year's Diliye Biennale will establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to get a chance to know the vibrant culture industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia, and to strengthen the ties between the two.
said Tian Fuyi, "The goal of the biennale is to be double, to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and to allow Saudi viewers to be immersed in the contemporary art world."
, It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the biennial, with artists, curators and creative industry opinion leaders discussing cross-cultural exchange, contemporary art development, and other topics.

China.org.cn: The management of public service posts in rural areas of Yunnan province is standardized and rationalized.
, The Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter: Lin Bingfeng) To continue to provide employment support for the poor people in the rural areas, and to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, the Yunnan province has issued the relevant policies for the management of public service posts in the rural areas, to support the process of building a new rural area.
The Yunnan provincial government said that since the program was launched in March 2017, 44,83,000 public service positions have been created in rural areas, to help the poor people in the countryside find jobs and earn money, to help them to achieve the goal of poverty alleviation, to improve the quality of public services in the countryside, and to help them to achieve the goal of sustainable development.
云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发的《关于印发云南省乡村公益性岗位开发管理暂行办法的通知》，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。
The new regulation clearly states that the job development setting is to be carried out in accordance with the principle of "need-based setting, person-based setting, dynamic management, total control", "setting by the developer, using by the user, responsible by the user", and "one person, one job, voluntary public, unified management".
the recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with the notice, application, examination, announcement, appointment, training, and placement on the job.
In addition, the new regulation specified the specific duties of the main departments responsible for the development of rural public service posts, the standard of the rural public service posts, and the method of payment of the rural public service posts, and stipulated that the main departments responsible for the development of rural public service posts should purchase insurance for the rural public service posts for the purpose of providing them with insurance, and required the relevant departments to regularly monitor the payment of the rural public service posts.
The address is wrong.
Good morning.
Please cancel the order.
I ordered a new one.
The meeting has been canceled.
Right-wingers have had their time, but it is short, because they are like sunshine and water; they are like the grasshopper who gets excited by the slightest wind and the ant who gets excited by the slightest drop of water.
to be honest, the rightists have played a positive role in the social progress.
's positive aspects should not be ignored.
Three, for me, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's views, I am very concerned with his views and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about the social problems in China.
I do not agree with his anti-communist theory, I think that anti-revolution is necessary, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, people's livelihoods will be damaged, political groups will be chaotic and muddled, and foreigners will take advantage of it.
and change or improve China, we must have patience and a responsible attitude, and those who try to take advantage of the situation by playing politics are not rightists, but scoundrels.
, Let's talk about left.
, Left is really a bunch of discarded times and politics.
If left has a positive meaning for society, the communist party will listen to some left-wing views and analyze their thinking, but right-wingers will have no such luck, because right-wingers want what the communist party has thrown away.
, Five, I recently saw some friends arguing with the enemy while refuting the leftist, and I think it's quite unnecessary.
and the Japanese collaborator and the leftist idiot.
don't try to prove we're right, and don't even think of trying to make the leftist and the anti-revolutionists admit it, why?
I told my friends this way: When the enemy insults you with five dollars, the leftist insults you with two dogs, this proves that our middle course is right.
many people have ideals in their youth, but as they grow older, they forget their ideals, or pursue their ideals, but become obsessed.
and the ideal is gradually fading away, even the dragon boy becomes a dragon.
and I think that the left and right means the restraint and freedom, China from the historical cultural gene makes China overall to be left.
is a rightist liberal, focused on efficiency and development, while the leftist is a more conservative, focused on fairness and safety.
The general society is now more inclined to be fair, and the US-China rivalry is likely to continue for many years. Left-wing is likely to remain the norm.
Even if you can't understand, just hit the like button.
Nothing to say, just like that.
the recent blockade and embargo of Huawei's chips by the US has not only put Huawei in a difficult situation, but has also caused great losses to US companies.
The U.S. has been blocking the Chinese chip industry, requiring its own companies and allies to do the same, which has led to the global chip supplier's orders and profits being affected, causing the chip production companies to reduce their R&D investment, decrease their production capacity, and cause the global chip supply chain to be in short supply.
is now affecting all major industries, such as car makers, smartphone makers, and all industries that use chips.
to gain control over the chip industry, many major tech companies are beginning to go "off-US"
In order to keep the global semiconductor control, to restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the US has been making a lot of moves recently, such as hosting the "IC Summit"; inviting 64 major companies to form the semiconductor alliance, and providing funds to support the US's major technology companies, such as Intel, which invested $200 billion in Arizona to build two semiconductor factories and open the manufacturing business to the public.
most people thought intel's move would cause a certain impact on taiwan's semiconductor industry and might even take away taiwan's "jobs"
's because Intel is a long-established American tech giant that has been in the semiconductor business for decades, has a large talent pool and technical expertise, and is bound to rise quickly and beat TSMC in the short term.
, However, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC, Chang Chien-ming, was not impressed by the decision of Intel.
In April this year, the 2021 Master Mind Forum was held. In the forum, Chang Chien-Ming made a surprising statement. He was unconcerned about Intel's decision to build a chip factory, saying that it was a very ironic decision.
's attitude toward Intel's move into the chip-making business is largely due to his resentment of the 30-year old feud between TSMC and Intel.
sixties and seventies, intel was the jewel of the american manufacturing industry, the top of the world, the world leader in semiconductor.
to the 1980s, the world semiconductor high-end chip was controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which the chip was manufactured by a single factory from design to packaging, and Intel was the representative of that time.
such a model has burdened some small businesses, many semiconductor entrepreneurs have been unable to bear the huge cost of building a factory.
In the 1980s, the chip industry began to show signs of cooperation, as the market demand for chips prompted the emergence of specialization. In 1984, when he heard of a company specializing in chip design, Mr. Chang thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then there should be a company specializing in chip manufacturing.
's design soon became reality, and TSMC was born.
focuses on the single process of wafer fabrication, not design, but provides the service of manufacturing wafers.
was just a little boy when it came to the Intel Corporation.
In order to obtain capital support, Mr. Chang Jong-mok approached Intel Investments, but at the time Intel was too arrogant to see the value of TSMC, and refused to invest in TSMC.
, Chang Chien-ming also believed that Intel was disdainful of the semiconductor process at the time.
I didn't expect the big companies to start doing wafer fabrication services.
, So, Mr. Chang thinks that Intel's entry into the chip-making business is a bit ironic.
's market value is now greater than that of Intel.
Intel is naturally not going to stand still in the face of the strong offensive of TSMC.
Now, TSMC is racing to 3nm, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
to catch up is not easy.
Wait no longer.
It's already 2 hours since I ordered at 19:16.
, Come and see some weird trending topics today.
what is normal public opinion?
Select three hot topics at random: February 2nd, the dragon rising, the price hike of Kraft Macaroons, the case of the delivery service company, the spread of the news, the peak of the wave, then the index drops (the smooth curve) finally fades, if there is a secondary news, there will be a small hump again.
look like the model of the Internet public opinion evolution proposed by the website of the Internet and mass media administration.
what is abnormal public opinion?
select six hot topics from the same event, and present them as a "mountain peak", a "sawtooth", and a "valley".

Figure 9 shows that the heat wave of an event exactly matches the trough of the other event, and the time difference is a second, and it is certain that the same army received the order to launch a new attack.
The professionalization of black PR is apparent: dozens of hot topics are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for education, which are engaged in war-making, which are used to divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which are used to influence decision-making, which are carried out in a serial and planned manner.
is a science, a science that ignores all personal feelings, and only takes into account objective data, black PR will be unable to hide.
, Every step is a mark, a mark we made together.

Received is money.
Order the chicken feet.
. All right, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called to explain to your staff.
I was told by your rider that the address was too far.
The big three hundred is a home building company.
Address: 156 Ring Road,幸福家园12楼
I was recommended by a friend because I trusted him. I chose to see if the budget was right.
the trick began when he came into the shop.
I was the first time to visit the store just to show them my floor plan, they didn't even go to measure the house, they gave me a price of 70000 for my 135 square meter house, they showed me their materials and didn't know what brand they were.
second trick is that you just go into the store and they drag you into the room and take your deposit (and once you do that, you can't get it back, unless you have enough experience to fight them and win).
I was hesitant to pay the deposit, and they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that you would get a certain amount of discount if you paid the deposit today.
is a big hole, and I am a living example of being tricked, when I was in a rush and paid a thousand dollars in advance.
His price has a lot of problems, 7,000 does not include water and electricity, does not include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom, and these three are the main costs of the base.
their service charge is higher than that of other companies.
I lost confidence in the company, and they didn't tell me anything about the contract before I signed it.
when I asked them to refund me, they showed me a lot of experience, with a special team to deal with you.
is the customer's fault, they are not to blame.
I won't go into detail, but basically don't choose them, because my friend hired them to remodel his house and it turned out to be of poor quality, and then they charged him for all kinds of fees.
, They are the same old fake decoration, but now they are called Big Beauty, and they seem to have closed down and changed to another one.
, So don't choose such a shitty company.
, When you choose, you can look up these things on Baidu, and ask these questions, because the cost of the renovation is not small.
Sign in or register to ask questions.
The posting of any form of merchant review is strictly prohibited, and detailed information is available in the merchant's listing policy.

, This is so scary, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
, Isn't there another way? Like, changing the address?
Okay, then don't cancel the conversation, if it takes 5 to 10 days to refund me, I'll be sure to take you to court.
I asked if we could cancel within 15 minutes.
I ordered the dry chicken, but received the raw meat. I can't eat it.
The Greatest Meteor Show on Earth: The Greatest Meteor Show on Earth will be on June 14 - Xinhua
The Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomers say that the northern hemisphere's last major meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, will reach its peak on December 14, and that meteorologists are advised to look for the shower on the following night.
December 13, 2018, Beijing astronomical enthusiast Anju took a picture of the Gemini meteor shower in Gansu.
most meteor showers are associated with comets, but the Gemini meteor shower is associated with the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo asteroid.
's Gemological流星雨 is also the second known not to be a cometary shower.
Astronomer and popular science expert Shu Leping said that like the blockbuster movies, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears in the end of the year, " the release date" can last from December 4 to 17.
comet shower is known for its large and steady stream, and is considered one of the three great comets showers in the Northern Hemisphere, alongside the Orion's Belt and the Perseid.
's brightest meteor shower, the Gemini, has a distinct feature: the meteors are slow-moving, colorful, and quite often fireballs, making them both good to see and good to photograph for beginners.
December 13, 2020, astronomer Yang Jinhua from Tianjin observed the Gemini meteor shower in Tianjin Baoding.
The astronomical forecast indicates that the Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on December 14 at about 15 o'clock, with a ZHR of 150 (in ideal conditions, when the radiant point is above the head, one can see 150 meteors an hour).
's Gemological流星雨 recommendation chart.
the Gemini meteor shower last year left a deep impression on people, but this year's meteor shower will be affected by the moon, so the show will be a little less spectacular.
The full moon on November 11 is a waxing crescent, and the moonlight will be bright enough to interfere with the observation. The moon will set in the late evening, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise.
fans of the meteor shower can observe the shower in the late evening after the moon sets, but be careful of the cold.
how can one see more meteor showers?
” It is not recommended to observe the moon in the city, but in the suburbs or in the countryside, one can choose a high altitude, a small light pollution, a good view to the north, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then observe it by sight.
's meteor shower is very bright, so you don't have to look at the point of the shower to see it.
friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens to capture the beautiful 'rainbow' effect, and use a high ISO and the maximum aperture to shoot.
, “For stability and continuity, a tripod, a spare battery and a shutter release cable are also essential.”
, Siu Ling Ping reminded him.
what are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
As I understand it, the traditional TV refers to the LCD TV, and the difference between the LCD TV and the laser TV is mainly in the market positioning.
, First, laser TVs are more focused on the large screen market.
compared to the market positioning of the LCD TV, the laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TVs are 55-65 inches, while the laser TVs are 75 inches or above, and the largest one is over 100 inches, fully meeting the demand of the users for large screen TVs.
laser TVs have been increasing in global sales and market share, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV market in sizes over 80 inches.
's prediction, the market for laser TVs will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and will continue to grow at a high rate.
's success in the large-screen market is largely due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in terms of eye protection.
Based on the principle of laser television reflective imaging, the light source of the laser does not directly enter the eye, but rather the light emitted by the LCD backlight source, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of the object, the eye is less stimulated.
's laboratory and the Beijing Hospital of Ophthalmology, through a strict comparison experiment of 144 groups of people viewing laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions, have come to the conclusion that the laser TVs are more harmful to the eyes.
data proves that laser TVs are indeed very eye-friendly, in some respects even beneficial.
laser TVs, which are gaining popularity for their eye health benefits, have also opened up a new market segment for the TV industry.
, Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the falling prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs are generally over a thousand dollars, and increase with size and light source.
why are laser TVs so expensive?
must be true.
laser TV has many advantages over LCD TV and projector.
With the help of ultra short focal length projection technology, laser TV's projection distance is shorter than that of traditional projection devices, which can bring 100-inch screen experience within short distance, and the host is small and occupies little space.
laser TVs with big brands can reach 2000+ lumens in brightness.
has a lower heat output, which makes it less likely to damage the equipment, and also lasts longer.
apart from that, many high-end laser TV models also come with 4K ultra-high-definition, AI system, and a bio-inspired screen, which can provide users with a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It is not a fake need, but a product of demand segmentation, as for picture quality and return on investment, laser TV is not the kind of player for audio and video, so if you want to combine large screen and viewing environment, you can try, everything has its pros and cons, weigh the pros and cons and then make your own judgment, just be careful of what you hear.
, In short, the ultra-wide-angle short-focal-length projection lens - laser TV, to be close to the screen, it is necessary to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
the cost of using a micro-structure screen to block some ambient light is high, and the price of a 80-inch screen is about the same as a 65-inch LCD.
I also hate the way manufacturers use the term "anti-glare" as a selling point, please, the light that the screen emits for the eyes is direct light, the light that the screen reflects is not visible to the eyes, and to be honest, LCD TVs are just as glare-inducing as the ones with a reflective screen, and the light from the TV itself doesn't make the room any brighter either.
, And, if the screen is not a reflective screen, it will not make a picture.
is the only way to describe the effect of the hot spot on the screen. The effect is so painful that you can't even look at the screen at an angle.
Visual Photography Gallery is a premium quality store.
added the date on WeChat, and the lady sent me the available time slots, and responded to my messages quickly.
before I went, I had already seen the store's wedding photography, more of outdoor wedding photography, which was very beautiful, and the style of the photography was also very different.
The day of the shoot, I had a brief chat with the sister, and she was very patient and helped me try on two different styles of clothes, and finally decided to start the makeup and hair styling. The photographer would set up some props, and guide the action, and was very meticulous about the details.
Maybe because I didn't talk about my specific shooting ideas with him, so he didn't get the style I wanted, but it was pretty anyway.
the photographer will help you choose the best photos, and will also give you tips on how to style them, so it's really thoughtful.
the repaired film will take about half a month to be ready, so be patient.
, Second time to win the photo shoot, most of the clothes can choose one to take photos.
she finally chose a black tulle dress to try on different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting, and the photographer who took the photos was a 95-year-old brother, so he was a little bit shy, but I hope he can give more suggestions to the customer in the future about the shooting action, he is very talkative, and the shooting process was very pleasant.

These three actually are very strict, in short, it is necessary to have the ability, it must be approved by the national authority of the insurance and banking supervision, the shareholders must have good habits, the umbrella insurance company, the insured person is not required to question the legitimacy of the umbrella insurance company, since there are these three standards, not all the insurance companies can reach.
, At this point, it's okay, it's reliable.
From the insurance products: Xiaoyu伞保险 is a insurance supermarket, many companies' famous life insurance products are sold on this platform, such as the latest launched and泰 Super Mary 5号 life insurance, the insurer and the insured are both and泰人寿, Xiaoyu伞保险 is just a third-party broker, so don't doubt its credibility.
from the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products are generally more affordable, and the payment mode is flexible, supporting monthly payment, relieving the burden of insurance premiums, and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
is still very good.
might be worth considering.
From the perspective of the agent's professionalism, this is especially important, because insurance is a very professional industry, and many Internet products can be purchased by the customer themselves, so there will be many misunderstandings, in the health declaration and the occupation, non-insurance employees often add their own subjective ideas, believing that they are healthy or suitable, which may lead to the risk of being denied insurance.
I used to work for a health insurance company called “Tencent Weibo” (which is similar to the little umbrella, also an insurance brokerage platform) and I was very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real, reliable, and unreliable. The unreliable part is people, the Internet channel has no professional staff, and there are many sales misunderstandings.
For example, $1 insurance covers 600 million, buy insurance and get a phone, free get 6 million of the disease insurance, these marketing strategies are right, but they are too light, they don't tell the customer that the first month is $1, the second month is charged according to the normal price, from $29 to $200, many customers pay for two years and don't know what they buy.
I thought I could spend $1 and get $600,000 from the insurance company.
free handset is only given to the special number range like 666, 888, etc., and if the winning SMS is sent, you don't have to redeem it, and no one will remind you.
For the insured, this is another hole. Free 6 million in medical coverage, it's a short-term deal, if you only rely on this, without other business insurance, if you really have a medical problem, 6 million can do what, can't solve the problem, and your life will start to run naked.
is also being actively prosecuted for misleading the public about Internet insurance sales.
, So overall, the platform is fine, the product is fine, the problem is the professionalism and ethics of the salesperson.
The writer suggests that the subject consider carefully, as many insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, with more choices for the customer, and some products are more affordable than online products.
myself have helped 59 Internet clients, insured the offline products, and saved each person 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serviced over 1000 corporate users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will take the customer's demand into consideration, customize the insurance product for the customer, during the insurance, I will compare the insurance companies for the customer, try my best to get the best underwriting result for the customer, after the insurance, I will do the insurance document management, the insurance document custody, so that the customer can be sure and worry-free.
every customer with us will grow together.
hope my answer will be helpful to you!
Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures by themselves after clicking the insurance link provided by the insurance regulator.
the insurer does not need to sign the contract, the insurance agent does not need to sign the contract, and all the steps can be completed by the insured person himself.
Internet insurance is not so "ritualistic", even if it doesn't have a printed copy of the contract, and it is not affected by the electronic version's validity and legality.
, This kind of model, somewhat similar to the "telephone sales", is a kind of production line, but buying insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the service after the purchase may not be timely.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades, and we should think carefully about the "agent" we choose to buy insurance from, as this agent will be with us for many years to come and will provide us with services in the future as well.

The most powerful weapons in the world have rarely visited the island of Guam since 2017.
，（@南海战略态势感知） The US Navy’s three carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China’s coastline, the most powerful weapons have rarely visited Guam since 2017, and the U.S. Navy’s CAV-22B carrier transport aircraft flew over Guam on January 17, 2022.
The most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, according to CNN on January 17.
The USS Nevada nuclear submarine, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Guam naval base on Saturday, January 15.
美三航母集结中国周边 最强大武器罕见访问关岛 分析称，这是向印度-太平洋地区日益紧张的局势中的盟友和敌人发出了一个信号。
is the first time the U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second time it has visited the island since the 1980s.
three American warships have gathered in the vicinity of China, the most powerful weapons have rarely visited the island of Guam, and China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea.
is a picture of the island of Vossuzhishan in the South China Sea.
The U.S. Navy in its statement said that the Ohio-class submarine "Nevada" made the visit to Guam to strengthen cooperation between the U.S. and its allies in the region, to show the U.S.'s capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
submarines are usually called "boomer" submarines.
of the U.S. Navy fleet of 14 submarine carriers is usually kept strictly secret.
The secret around ballistic missile submarines made the "Raygun" a "critical survival weapon" in the triad of nuclear weapons, including the launch sites on the American mainland and the B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear weapons.
his Facebook friends talked about the recent drop in Meta's share price by 26%, its market value dropping by 2510 billion dollars, and Mark Zuckerberg responded that "there is unprecedented competition", why?
Facebook is essentially a marketing company, with its main source of income being advertising, and a company that makes money today is one that has a traffic source.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever the function positioning is, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the biggest " advertising network ", many apps connect Meta's ads, through Meta's advertising platform, they make money.
, But, times have changed.
, First, because of the privacy policy change of Apple, Meta is no longer able to get the user data, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's privacy policy is very friendly to users, and will be very obvious to users whether to allow the app to access their information, most people's normal reaction will be to not allow.
Google's next move could hurt Meta even more.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth has weakened (the factor's weight is uncertain, but it does exist).
people know Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not correct.
Meta earns at least 10% of its income from China, mainly from companies doing business in China.
's Meta office in Hong Kong has about a hundred people, and there are several big agents in China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, so the money they spend on Meta is mostly wasted.
Interestingly, TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from TT in the past two years.
's agents are all helping BitTorrent to advertise on Meta, and Meta's Chinese division is doing well.
I haven't been actively looking into it, but I don't think it'll be any better than before.
Chinese companies are no longer in the stage of massive overseas spending.
, Third, the new flow channel has not been expanded successfully.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
biggest problem isn't just a drop in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
market capitalization is not just about income, but also about the future expectations.
, Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
Zuckerberg told the market a new story about the "cosmic web".
The future direction of the universe is indeed one of the possibilities, but the realization of the meta-universe is a long process, so the story in the last two or three years won't be enough to support the value of Meta.
, So, in the next two years, Meta should be very difficult.
Facebook is very successful now, with annual revenues of $1 billion to $2 billion, but Facebook is very aware of its current situation, and has no good security buffer against other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
, Although his several social apps have a high daily active users, they are also mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but he has little confidence in Facebook's ability to overthrow TikTok in the blink of an eye.

新华社河内12月12日电（周娜 滕怀金）12日上午，参加中越两军“和平救援-2021”卫勤联合演习的中方参演分队全部安全返回中国广西境内，标志着此次持续7天的演训任务顺利完成。
