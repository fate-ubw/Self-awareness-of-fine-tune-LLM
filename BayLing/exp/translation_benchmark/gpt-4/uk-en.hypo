Good day, sorry, please, I didn't have internet and couldn't send it sooner. Thank you.
Please tell me the exact address where to go for cleaning tomorrow, what is the code for the keys, and at what time the guests are leaving tomorrow and new guests are checking in?
Unfortunately, I have to decline your offer because during this time I have already found a job.
Sorry, but I cannot refuse there.
Sometimes it seems to me that through the translator, my thoughts in Czech differ from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
Please tell me, is there an earlier time?
Since I do not live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no options, I agree anyway.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people took to the streets again for a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse them.
As the event participants told the agency, the people of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived to disperse it.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now, the equipment from the Russian Federation has arrived there," - said one of the participants of the event.
Earlier, city residents traditionally gathered for protest actions in Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, as well as the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against protesters and abduct people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protest actions against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces are using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders are kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson the special title of "Hero City."
On February 24, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive bombardments of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launch systems, and ballistic missiles.
I often dream of my dad here.
He died the day after my birthday.
In general, the dreams are good.
Hana, good day.
I did as you wrote and the phone started charging!
Very good news!
Thank you!
We can meet for an hour or two, and then I will go home because I don't have the necessary things with me.

Oleg also found me a part-time job - cleaning 2 apartments that are rented to tourists on a daily basis.
Apartments are located in the center of Prague.
Will it be convenient for you to go to the bank with me on Monday? Or another day?
Good day, it would be good if you could today as you wrote at 17:00.
That's why I read the Bible, the Quran, and other things to find answers to the questions I was looking for answers to.
Where is the housing that needs to be cleaned?
Do you mean having good dreams?
In addition to this report, I am sending you a list of job vacancies offered to us by employers.

God willing, may we arrive safely.
When you arrive, call me on the phone. The doorbell doesn't work.
It would be better if it was cheaper... we are forced to move because we cannot afford European prices financially.
I need to take a look at the spot and try to see in which places it hurts.
He wants to press on all my sore spots now, he knows which ones.
This no longer has absolutely no influence on me.
Didn't want to talk about him and his drama yesterday when Misha was around.

Did you mean that we clean by ourselves and you just supervise?
Can Valya and I swap shifts? Valya in the morning, and me after lunch?
Mom will live here in the dormitory because the fee for the dormitory is small here.
The main thing is that I have a place to live.
Sasha was not at school today, I wrote an email to the teacher.
Helloüëãüèª I got sick, so it would be better to reschedule our meeting for the next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake pastries.
In Ukraine, traditional dishes include borscht, varenyky, and others.
I don't have any favorite dishes, I love trying various dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something.
More precisely, there is a train, but there are no seats.
Sorry, but we are a little late.
Lucia, can I also be an assistant in the kitchen?
It's very good that Yulia will have the opportunity to go to work.
I went to their apartment yesterday evening.
There it is very crowded and convenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there will be a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train.
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, if it stops beating, we will have weak positions.
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian Armed Forces suffer defeat there, the Russians may abandon negotiations and reoccupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol, you know, is the heart of this war today."
It fights - we fight, we get stronger.
If it stops fighting ‚Äì our positions will be weaker.
They (the city defenders - ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies onto themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the JFO (Joint Forces Operation) area, and if they become stronger, the negotiation table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, we may not make it to the meeting.
Because then Russia will be taking all these steps that could lead to the return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for this too.
Then our position in the negotiations will be weaker and maybe even not interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we note.
We believe in our result, in our victory...
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go for negotiations after torturing Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have it."
Direct speech: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end."
On our terms, the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war should end with peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even there, where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
You cannot fight for the saw when there is nothing left, no people.
Good day, do you still have available spots for the Czech course for adults at 19:00 on Tuesday?
If you wish, you can meet your family in Kutn√° Hora.
And here are these two, they are my cousins.

I'll try to clean up quickly, but I don't promise.
I will write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominika, who is responsible for purchasing consumables?
Is this procedure permanent, or should it be ordered as it is completed?
In connection with the change in the esthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The very analysis of the metaphorical space in Ukrainian literature, the study of the state.
The Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows for the analysis of the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.
Maybe you know how to inform online that I have found a job and no longer claim assistance?
I don't have the opportunity to go in person(((((( thank you, I need to print this form to fill it out.

Moreover, we go to work and collect money.
On Monday, we will have a leadership meeting and we will decide how and when we will hold it at our place.
Well, because I already started to worry that I misunderstood something and ended up in the wrong place.
I think it's the right decision, it's better to have fewer people and be able to provide quality assistance to them, than when there are many people.
My 16-year-old daughter and I are looking for temporary accommodation in the Czech Republic, where she plans to study at the University.

Currently living in Prague 9. Ready to move anywhere if there is a job. I would be very grateful for any advice or suggestions.
But if you don't want to communicate with me, then I am sad.
Why did you decide that you didn't need such an experience?
Every situation is given for something.
It is important for a person to change, especially spiritually.
I will give you this money once the bank approves it.
About 30,000 UAH in debts that you have, plus 30,000 UAH so that you have some left.
Janka, I hope everything is good with you, and your grandmother won't call me bad words.
Trying to put Sasha to sleep... It's necessary for him to get at least a little sleep...

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
As Ukrinform reports, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!"
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade who are directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha, according to the statement.
In the GUR MOU, it is noted that all military criminals who have committed crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine will stand trial and be held accountable.
You can view the list by following the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by Russian military have been recorded.
On April 1, the city mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in the mass graves.
Attorney General Iryna Venediktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive bombardments of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launch systems, ballistic missiles, and aerial bombs.
Good day, I apologize, but I will not be able to work for you because I will be flying to Canada soon.
Immediately after the dash are formal names, after the slash are slang expressions, in parentheses - abbreviations used in the schedule of hours.
I don't want to bother you, rest.
I watched the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brandy.
Just nice clothes at reasonable prices and with available sizes.
We were at the store at the railway station.
Professions that are offered. Is it possible without language knowledge?
This is important, if there is such a tradition, then I need to know so that I can prepare)
I thought in a week, but the situation here is heating up, sirens constantly.
Tomorrow there might be bad connection on the road.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I have gained experience from every situation for myself in order not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are made in the form of numbered written amendments, which are part of this Regulation.
I am sure that there will be no problems with this.
In Ukraine, many people also celebrate this week.
This depends on the religious denomination.
Is a person Greek Catholic or Catholic.
At the beginning, you can try it for free.
Can you write us a payment algorithm, we will pay ourselves.
We have that paper that children receive at the end of the school year, which is a report card, and a certificate is received at birth and marriage.
Yes! He is on it like an experienced driver! But I don't know if it's better. I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
There it says that you need to fill out a "biography" in Czech.
I will try to make it in time, because I still have to go to the town hall to sign documents.
The wife is not angry that you are on the phone.
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Virgin Mary for you.
May they wrap you in their blanket of love and warmth tonight.
My heart belongs to you.
You don't mind if I come right after the war?
The place, day, and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I would be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of tortured and executed people shocked the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
And from me, nothing surprised at all. Exactly what I was sadly expecting is happening...
I evacuated the children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then he met female colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never doubted for a moment that if the suburbs of Kyiv were occupied, my family would not be spared.
I have been and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communo-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, he simply cannot exist, he is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, in the Zhytomyr SBU, they allowed to make a copy of the execution case of the great-grandfather: the whole case is over a hundred pages, but the death sentence is very simple and therefore even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate and denied the guilt.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "single estate" nobility, never went into serfdom.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to condemn the plowman and the caretaker of young children to execution.
Relatives did not even find out about the burial place.
Grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village at that time and all were killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, there is the surname of the informant Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
As is well known, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree...
The firing squad that condemned the peasants to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of my great-grandfather, I became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as "Immortal Barrack", which qualitatively remind us of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD members have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited by the system and then destroyed.
It seems that they found files with child pornography on the computer, put her in prison for it, and she quickly died there.
KGB agents are still killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most disgusting features of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year-old tradition of the Horde, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then, over what came out, they conducted a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" from 1992, that's how it was.
Did you see my photos in a swimsuit?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cough?
Sorry, but I have no one to ask.
I would like to ask if you know where the children went, because Halya cannot find them.
Lyubosh, Ihor is asking if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (he is off and can go because they haven't looked at the car at the station today yet).
We are very sorry to bother you so much.
You are helping us a lot, thank you!!
In Borodyanka near Kyiv, during the clearing of debris from two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
Mariupol defenders reported the dispersal of an unknown toxic substance over the city from a Russian drone.
Three people were injured.
In Russian prisons, approximately 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are being held.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense sector companies.
Over the past day, in the battles in eastern Ukraine, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of automotive equipment, one helicopter, and three drones were destroyed.
Your coffee will arrive today)
I have my first "bicycle" after my son.
When the girls return from studying, what do they do next?
We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big but, here live men who drink alcohol and smoke in the room, loud music is the least that "disturbed", the smell of cigarettes, drunk men and we are with children... it's scary to sleep, to be honest.
Please help with accommodation, for money please.
But where it will be safe and not smoky.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is as if they are being smoked right here.
I beg you very much, one of them can barely stand on his feet, he is shouting something, he doesn't like something. It's very scary.
I just pray if you can helpüôèüèº
The main thing is that we understood each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful kindergarten, such pleasant teachers.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, very grateful to you‚ù§Ô∏è
Good evening Stefani, Agata wants to participate in the game, she missed the game üòâ
We cannot reach that hatch.
For now, we are not ready to pay such money, we will wait for help and then plan something.
How can I get to the apartment today to clean?
When I am near the main entrance, should I inform you and you will open it?
I wanted to see if I have time to look for a cake for Karina somewhere.
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked to send you greetings and say that they are very interested in reading the news.
They talked about people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them by phone.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
This suits me just fine on holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to Easter ceremonies.
Thank you üèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏è today I will write my work data.
Dany really enjoyed it, thank you for the organization.
So Nestor only has a runny nose for now, and Halynka has a temperature of 37.7, which rises to 38 in the evening.
The line for General Chapek there is moving very slowly.
There is a chance for everyone.
The main thing is that love should be genuine and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish, mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will work out.
Yes, we took it home and brought it to our aunt right away.
She was very, very grateful, she even cried.
I was telling her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it's possible, there might be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessary. Only if it happens. I am also very grateful to you.
I always felt sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.
I had many questions for God, why in my life there were situations that simply forced me to lose faith in everything.
And do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the collection.
This is true, but we are still not familiar with the area and do not know where everything is located. Today we were looking for a supermarket for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so two large ones are needed.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only know how to speak Russian, or is there someone else in the family who does?
Is it possible for the children to come to Vali and play in the hall?
Well, alright, let's take the risk then :)
I am also glad to have met you.
I talked to Volodymyr about housing, whether to wait for them to find it or to look for it myself. The ladies who live with us said that we need to go to the metro station "Muzeyna", there is an institution that helps to find housing.
Because of the little one, I will overcome the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ
On some of their questions, I didn't even know the answers.
It would be good on Thursday if possible.
I cannot call the doctor because I still haven't done the food license examination.
But I can't call him because I ran out of money on my account.
I cannot top up my phone because I do not understand Czech online banking, and it cannot be topped up with a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafone app, I can neither change the tariff to have normal calls and internet nor top up the number.
I'm already going crazy.
Where the cheeks are not the price, but the face... The title sounds wrong, what did you mean?
I am ashamed to sit without a job.
Just wrote that at school during the lesson.
Sorry for bothering you, I was just really worried.
That is closer to when they will leave the borders of Ukraine, to know for sure that they will arrive.
Because there, everyone's life is in question right now.
Okay. Size for 10-11 years old. But our sizes do not match. Everything needs to be measured.
Looking for everything for the house and for the children.
Thank you to the people who accepted me, I live in a chapel, they always ask if I need anything, but I am ashamed to say and try to find it myself.
I just came home and now I'm having breakfast :)
Please don't explain anything, just act like I'm not here.
It is impossible to answer without a submitted resume.
Mom, I won't be able to tell you something like that :)
And I really feel a bit uneasy now that I couldn't hold back my feelings before we left the apartment... Like tonight....
God willing, Yura will fall asleep üôè maybe then I will immediately lie down too, to get some sleep.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Suzana, help me. I received the payment for March. Is it for both me and Yulia or just for me, I can't figure out why the amount is like this.

I turned to Caritas, where they offered temporary housing for a week or two, but I need permanent housing where I could be with my child, and why there is less and less left.
The flowers were watered. Everything is fine. Everyone is rested and very beautiful.
As reported by "European Pravda", Welt writes about this, citing sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, amounts to 1.7 billion euros.
As well as offering howitzers in the Boxer APC variant for 1.2 billion euros.
At the time when tanks in battle have to approach relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at distances of over 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, which means no earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And is this in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find out how to replenish the account and dial. I will get back to you. Thank you.
I am going to work tomorrow without passing the commission, and then when my doctor recovers, I will pass the commission, did I understand correctly?
How can I change my T-mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns now?
Hello, I apologize. I would like to ask if you need a worker?
Can wash the floor or do the dishes.
I am from Ukraine, unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need a job.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I agree to any job.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I study every day, so I think I will learn everything necessary to work without any problems.
I've been talking to you a lot today, you probably need to sleep so you can work tomorrow.
If possible, I will take these pants for work. The size fits me.
You are smart and everything will be fineüôè Rest, gain strength and beauty with a strong sleep!!!üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø

Did you manage to make friends with anyone?
So we wanted to resolve the issue with the card before Easter. We don't have internet banking, we don't know how to set it up. What do we need to do?
Turn to the Lord in whom we live?
Always say goodbye when you leave.
Avzhesh, can we do it after 17 o'clock?
Can I wash the laundry in the apartment tomorrow and hang it to dry in the garage?
Hello. Yes, I will be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How long did you study for this specialty?
If it were warm, it would be very good.
I submitted an online application. I will try to go there today after work.
Everything is fine with us. We manage with stove heating, we have experience in Ukraine, there is gas, but since it is very expensive, we heated the stove with firewood.
Good day, Lena, please tell me where is a nearby stationery store?
Tomorrow we are going to Prague to look at an apartment.
Everything was resolved by itself.
I have to take Karinka with me.
I put the laundry on, came home, translated what was written on the chair near the laundry room door - "channel repair, can I wash or should I turn off the washing machine?"
It says that my status will change within 24 hours. But why? What kind of comedy is this? üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Thank you, because something here is not working out very well for us.
And we even already have a product from the cradle.
Sorry, it means I got something mixed up.
At that time, I still didn't understand Czech so well.
I probably made something up for myself.
Indeed, they go to school like that, three of them, because Halya and Sviatoslav study remotely, finish school in Ukraine, and receive their diplomas in the fall, when they need to apply to universities.
Can you tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman make decisions in their family by themselves, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we will be together.
Why not try it this way for now?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will arrive with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? At what time do we need to leave?
Yes, I enjoy listening to jazz.
Thank you, I am working with this application, we were told about it at the Czech courses on Wednesday.
For the last four years, I haven't let anyone get close to me, read many philosophy books, and tried to understand myself.
When they hurt you very much, it's hard for you to trust.
But one must try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, that's life.
Martine, we are already going to sleep.
Thank you for such a beautiful and fun day.
We all really liked it.
We feel like we are in our own family.
The children spent the whole evening telling their dad, all the grandmothers and grandfathers how nice it was at your place.
Greetings from the girls! From us, the best wishes for the holidays üòâ
And where did we look now?
I hope that my son will come out alive from this meat grinder.
Let's go today, maybe we will need something.
How to contact them to open the doors?
Is there an improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Very grateful for helping people. If you can, help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are now in Slapi, friends have sheltered us for a while.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist, rehabilitation specialist looking for a job.
In order for the children to be able to attend school and for me to work, we need housing not far from civilization.
I just really needed to give it back today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.
I prepare cabbage rolls like this: in a saucepan, I dilute 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste in 0.5 liters of water and bring it to a boil.
I lay the cabbage rolls in a pot and pour this sauce over them.
Roast it in the oven for approximately 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this number?
I have to bring all this.
From Monday the 4th.
In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can request humanitarian assistance at their new workplace, the Labor Office at the Prague Market.
The branch in hall ‚Ññ29 is specifically designated for submitting and processing applications for assistance, so there is an interpreter on site.
Lydia has already been accepted to school, but due to illness, we will go on Tuesday. I informed the teacher today.
I am sitting, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, my love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I treat it as if we are together. That we are a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
That's why I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I can do many things.
That's why I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what will happen with the housing.üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to undergo an inspection for obtaining a food license. Can I do this with you?
Please let me know, tomorrow I need to prepare the apartment for 5 guests.
The fifth place, as I understand it, is in the room with the TV?
To unfold and make the sofa bed?
Can we stay with you until Ms. Margarita finds us accommodation?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, already used, but it's working and not needed.
Write the address in Czech, let's see on the map where it is located from us.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan anything with furniture. I want to finally look at that apartment this week and then understand what furniture I need.
Sorry for taking so long to respond, it was a busy day, hard to adapt.
Is this enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, to have the opportunity to hug you.
To kiss you in the morning, to tell you how good you look.
For the child, there is already a crib and a bathtub here, I found things for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you have the opportunity, but not to give the last thing ü§´üòüüòâüôÉ
I want to get a haircut called a cap.
Oleg got sick - he has a runny nose and a cough. It's better not to bring Yana with you to us, so she doesn't get infected.
I will be a little later - around 8. Is that okay?
I do not want misunderstandings with you.
Because I worry that everything will be alright!?
We didn't even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important this is for you!
And about myself, I am silent (for me, it is just a peak that cannot be reached)!
How are you feeling today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, slept poorly.
Excuse me for disturbing you.
I was upset that Kolya and I started translating the test poorly yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yonashek if they can help me a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to brush up on mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to practice with Kolya so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We really hope for that too.
But otherwise, she is very happy with any gift.
I would like to connect the internet to my Czech number.
Yesterday at the stop of bus 402, I met a Ukrainian girl - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I could not stay aside.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And yesterday evening, I thanked God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall ‚Ññ29 is specifically designated for submitting and processing applications for receiving assistance.
It turned out that I ordered a spare card.
It's not worth it, I'm just a person.
So that she wouldn't be scared that no one came.
I didn't go. Yes, I baked it myself. I can do that! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So are you leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Memorial Center "Babyn Yar" in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke about the "common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe."
We must protect this foundation - it is also a part of our responsibility connected with our history.
If "evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us, Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!"
The struggle must continue.
Today Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the residents of the cities it has blockaded, and letting them die from diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babi Yar.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real-time.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also supplying weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany delays the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to stand against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to overcome evil and stop the atrocities happening in Ukraine.
I'll sing you one song.
We agree, arrange the tour and let us know when to be gathered.
Everyone was sick, only Lydia was not sick; they had Omicron, a new type of COVID.
Then I will do it tomorrow.
I use this coupon instead of a card.
Ring for the delay of documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the conductor.
Sergiy Sydorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect.
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea, and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to decrease, while the number of supporters, on the contrary, started to grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in wartime conditions, there is now a lot of criticism regarding the Alliance and its member countries - for untimely arms supplies, refusal to close the airspace, and unwillingness to "corner" Russia.
Apart from this, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspiration for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions," we discuss with the editor of "European Truth" how exactly the Alliance has been helping Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and what the Alliance is criticized for in vain, why our perspective of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees being discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here?
In my Volt partner account, it is indicated that my application is under consideration.
I submitted it through this mobile app.
There is no visa, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, they did not give visas there, but they gave a PESEL (Polish identification number).
We will definitely write to you!
Denis went in a good mood today.
Agreed with the boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, to meet near the school so that he could show him everything.
I also hope that everything is fine with him.
Because I don't like it like that, it's not enough for me for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.
I am going to leave the children alone, wait there for 3-4 hours, and then go home because I can't leave them any longer.
And take with you at 6-7 in the morning.
Yes, the heart was sick.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he acted not very decently and I left him.
After some time, he returned and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after some time he called saying that he had a heart surgery.
After asking to simply talk with him, I started to feel sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we communicated a lot.
At that time, I started having problems at work simultaneously.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I wondered, maybe it really is necessary to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our fate.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
And he speaks only in Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find housing, and I am very happy about it ‚ò∫ now I have a place to live and a place to be with my child.
Should I have been reminded earlier?
After all, I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I understand myself that the translator does not always correctly translate the text.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, should she give a paper?
This is probably what the guests forgot, I put it in the closet.
You probably need to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Can someone help, need things for a woman size XS or S height 165. Also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you
That time at Lidl, I bought two packs and mom bought two.
It's very kind of you, thank you.
You lifted my spirits.
Okay, let's talk about something else, because I'm not sleeping anyway, I'm just falling asleep and dreaming that they're bombing...
God is never late, everything has its own time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the value of unskilled labor and realize that I will not be able to have the same job as I had at home in Kyiv, and I will not be able to earn the same money that I earned at home here either.
But I just can't sit and do nothing, because then all sorts of bad thoughts creep into my head, so I need to occupy myself with some physical activity.
At the airport, documents are processed from 7 in the morning until 7 in the evening; at other times, you can simply wait.
Volodymyr returned at 4 in the morning.
So we took them to our place.
We overslept with Vika in the kitchen, they put us in the bedroom.
I will finish work and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write and find out what's next...
Otherwise, I can't find a place for myself.
Sir, please, these are invitations for Ukrainian children who will be entering the gymnasium.
Yes, but I make it complicated.
Ok, write to me when it's convenient üòò
I don't know about the job yet. Of course, I would like to, if I can arrange for the children to go to kindergarten and school.
We planned it that way. Is it better for us to occasionally change shifts?
I'm sorry. I really don't have any missed calls from Wednesday. Can we agree on another date?
I offer a job: cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, wiping dust.
The work is about 3-4 hours. The amount is 800 UAH one-time. From 19.04 Tuesday, from 14.00.
I hope to tell you that everything is fine with us.
Can I call you?
Can you write down your wife's contact information?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
In our culture, Hanna is considered the root form of the name Anya.
Her uncle passed it on from home.
Made an English version, added new partners.
Write to him if something is needed.
Just don't forget about me, please üôèüèª
Are the classes on Monday and Wednesday different?
Thank you very much. You do a lot for our family! We are all immensely grateful to you.
To be in the pool, you need a certificate.
But that's my opinion.
My uncle passed on roller skates and a skateboard to her from home, she used to ride them at home, so it has to
I also got up at 9 o'clock, and only now am preparing breakfast.
I am very ashamed that you are talking to me on your day off. I hope I am not too annoying.
We would like to report a change of residence and at the same time submit documents for the extension of the card.
We are currently providing medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you that there will be a snack tomorrow.
One mom said that she will bake donuts with jam for the kids.
He is coming to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate cleaning schedule for the apartments for a month ahead, even for a rough understanding of which days?
I just can't memorize this schedule )
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv, saying "we haven't done this before."
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian forces on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation."
If such incidents continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army has previously refrained from doing.
Russians have been launching missile strikes on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation's occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky district.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multi-story building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a television tower in Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, as a result of which 5 pedestrians were killed.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles over the Southern railway station, which were flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14, fragments of a downed occupiers' missile destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka, Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vynohradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall in Vynohradar, as a result of which at least 4 people were killed.
The Mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, reiterated on April 13 that it is still too early for the residents of the capital who have evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and in addition, there are many mines and unexploded ordnance in the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1, near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are breaking out in a cold sweat at the mere thought of NATO fighters shooting down Russian bombers in the skies over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them, but rather with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands-strong crowds in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was unavailable to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European nations who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of strength, emotion, and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is adamantly against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Whether Paris or Brussels is against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, but this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want us to be considered scammers.
The money you collect is better to give to people who need it more.
I can come to you and we'll decide on the spot. I don't mind, as long as I can help.
Well, the air is clean, that's a plusüòÄ
It says there that I have the "Together for Two without Internet" tariff, but I asked to have the internet instead.
I do not understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any room today? Or, as always, just stairs up and down?
Then I'm already on my way and you're going by train.
But I will not stop loving you, you are everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days for this.
Katya was asking about the internet, can we give her the password?
I thought you and Milana didn't meet each other.
Great, then my husband will give me a ride because he has a car from the construction company where he works today.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and grandchildren are under Your protection!
Very grateful to you for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One needs to be cut into 4 parts.
One of these particles can be used for 2-3 days, but rinse every hour.
I am interested in architecture and color.
I am very glad that everything is fine with you.
Most likely, at 16:20, the concert will start at 6, and after it, I am free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
I will make tea and eat some candy.
I went to the school's page and now I will try to order lunch for Ani for tomorrow.
But I love to take a walk on weekends in the big [city/park].
Can we go there tomorrow and find out the conditions?
My name is Sasha and I came from Luhansk to Prague.
I am a certified massage therapist and nurse with 27 years of experience in the field of neurology.
I offer therapeutic massages, a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech languages and study intensively.
Contact: ------ would like a letter too, so that Czechs could write to you through a translator, SMS doesn't work here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you won't be able to understand each other.
Do you really not want this price?
He really helps people see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a price list, then I won't provide it.
Tell me how you want it, and I will do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write to me today.. for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely - today I am asking only for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask for your patience.
Is everything good with your imagination?
You live your usual life, go to work, plan purchases, vacation.
You have dreams.
You plan to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the shopping mall.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain cannot perceive this.
He clings to the old reality.
You are calling work to find out if you have to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... this won't last long.
Now... arranging... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many people were not paid their salaries by our managers at our jobs.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You do not have the ability to take many things.
You didn't take almost anything from home... you have to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning till evening, you drag children all over Prague.
And what's next? Unknown. How long like this? Unknown. Children ask for sweets. But you can't. It's expensive for you.
And from every iron - we don't have such a thing.
We have a choice - to stay there and expose our children to danger, or to try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy with those little hearts and things that the children gave her when she came to school.
You should have called me when you arrived.
I will write to you in the evening.
Yes, I only believe in God and entrust my life to Him.
I no longer have the strength for all of this.
I already thought that you fell in love with some Ukrainian girl and don't have time for communication üòá
In the menu, I figured it out and even already ordered.
Would you be interested in joint activities with your Czech neighbors, friends, community?
If so, then what specific type, kind?
Please send the page with the visa or entry stamp (red with the date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libushe, did you pay for the nursery?
Because I cannot understand.
You do so much good for us...
We are deeply indebted to you... thank you!
Yes, I understand that it is very good.
I will send you a photo of the business card of the lady I am teaching English to right now.
Well, what will you write tomorrow, will we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough means. It would be very good to know a person from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Don't you want to meet after 16:00?
What are your overall impressions of the first week?
Karina brought us the medicine the day before yesterday, and we are taking it.
I can work with bedridden patients and children with disabilities.
But it is necessary to indicate that I speak only Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have anything like that.
Can I borrow some laundry detergent from you?
Because there is only antibacterial gel there.
I can't say for sure because I'm not very familiar with the city yet... around half past 11.
What services/activities, in your opinion, are necessary/missing for elderly people?
I don't know because there hasn't been an SMS from the bank yet, and I haven't taken the bank card yet, and the children deleted the banking app, which made me very upset.
Then please write to me how you will be traveling üôèüèª
Today we have joy - our city Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, our troops have arrived.
The clearing of enemies is underway - they are searching for Russians in basements and apartments.
The entire city is mined, the demining work will begin.
And Ivan also looked to see if there was anything that needed to be repaired or something else to be done.
Diano, as you wish. Maybe he will be embarrassed, I don't know.
Panas, our friend, wants to stay at home, says he is tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will bake the anointed bread and do the lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs who opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractor drivers who actually go out into the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree today to travel in humanitarian convoys to the temporarily occupied territories in order to bring assistance there and to transport people from there.
These are heroic conductors who fearlessly go to the combat zone, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers load humanitarian aid into the wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utility workers who, under fire, remove garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the essentials.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining, and in their spare time, they volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front.
In Ukraine, the juice stops when there are small leaves.
Please tell me, when you say "little children," what age do you have in mind?
My daughter is 8 years old, is this age acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days in order to come to the Czech Republic and submit passports for visa processing to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and the online queue is not working.
I wanted to come for one day, but it is far away, the train journey takes a lot of time, and it will be hard for the child.
So she decided to look for accommodation in Prague or not far from it.
No, everything suits us.
Where to put away yesterday's appliances?
But I cannot change the password when I follow the link because it gives me such an error:
It's in the microwave, something was burning there.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks are always in touch with clients 24 hours a day and all issues are resolved promptly :)
Well, I'll get used to the new realities.
I am very uncomfortable and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post. The most important thing is that there is truth in it.
Yes, the TV is full of this.
We have already arranged for the refrigerators, some Czech guys responded and will come at 13:00 to help carry them.üëçüëçüëç
I want to come to you. Hug you tightly. And kiss you.üòò
At 7:30 I am reading the history of world theater to actors, directors, and theater scholars.
In the evening, I evaluate projects. After dinner.
Grishko is still sleeping, he cried a lot at night, a tooth is coming in.
I am currently on the phone with all my acquaintances from Lviv, many people have died.
Czechia started issuing visas after March 22, in my opinion.
Before that time, they put such stamps and then equated these stamps to visas.
The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (FED of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, [footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of Congo). [1] The role of the district electoral commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the foreign electoral district, only nationwide voting is held: elections of the President and people's deputies, as well as all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in the Eastern European countries are not held.
They are at the train station near the mother and child room.
Says they no longer understand where to go.
Are you mad at me?
I'll go delete the photo in a swimsuit.
I don't need money anymore, I borrowed it from a friend for a long term üòä
I wanted to say that I have already connected a Czech mobile number.
For this, I didn't need another device, I visited the O2 operator and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. It is very inconvenient for me, working on Sunday and I can't anymore.
You said that you have a broken washing machine. Take it for yourself. You really need it too.
We do not have enough blankets, down blankets, plates. The children do not have pajamas and have nothing to change into.
Good morning, I will be leaving at 10...please write the address again, the text message got lost somewhere.
I don't want to torture either you or myself, I will somehow deal with it inside myself.
So it would have been good, but I know that there were no free spots there, and in principle, they now have all the lessons scheduled and teach quite well.
Do you have a meat grinder to make minced meat? We have one, but it doesn't work.
Alright, let it be after Easter then.
Yesterday your mom said that something hurt you?
She cannot tell them everything she wants, and does not understand everything they say. But yesterday she came in a great mood after that fair.
Today I also went to school.
Today I saw Christina's mom, but she didn't even say hello.
Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is this?
Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak reported that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that our allies are transferring to us.
Direct speech of Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and want to 'knock down' arms supplies by any means."
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the Russians' scenarios. Name one of them.
They can spread fake news that Ukrainian soldiers are allegedly surrendering their weapons to allies, and these weapons are massively being transferred to the Russian army.
I want to warn about such fakes immediately.
The weapon in the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers exclusively sends the enemy to the other world.
Excuse me, please, I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten will cost per month and whether it will be open in the summer?
Everyone is given according to their strength.
There are much sadder stories, believe me.
It means that I had to go through such events in order to change.
In the Torah it is written that God created an evil beginning in a person so that throughout their life path they would change spiritually and become better.
This is your house, you can invite whoever you want)
How to find this lady on social media, tomorrow before going to the hospital we wanted to visit the town hall.
He listened to his mom and didn't come with us.
I know it was hard for you.
And I will do everything to make you happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I am happy.
I hope you really meant that. üíû
I have been looking at the announcements a lot, many are already taken. Now it is difficult, such is our fate.
Sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Didn't you manage to call today regarding the change of the mobile operator's tariff?
Sorry, but in this life I cannot rely on anyone.
Today I was offered a job for every day.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, while Moscow dismissed these reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainians killed, raped, and seriously injured by Russian forces are worthy of condemnation," stated New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents "a violation of international law."
The statements were made after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian forces who had left the area after occupying it for several weeks.
Photographs allegedly depicting the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian forces committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, stated that Russian forces could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me, the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials leaves no doubt as to who 'ordered' this story," said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another staging by the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to convene on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement announcing an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
On April 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from the Ukrainian language to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
"For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw bodies of allegedly civilians on the streets of a small town.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed at close range.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kyiv region, which was controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, we have everything, we bought everything according to the list.
They were told: "There is no Kyiv." How the occupiers insidiously deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
In this list, there is another item about which there is currently much less information - the deportation of the local population to the enemy territory.
Approximately from mid-March, Russian occupiers are "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko has effectively handed over to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainian Pravda" tracked down the evacuated Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the evacuation itself is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text resorted to a voluntary-compulsory evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, considering the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, a significant number of citizens were forcibly transported to Russia and Belarus.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took the children away from there without their parents, among whom was 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zacheppinsky.
Alexander and Marina's family, along with their 10-year-old daughter Valya, moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although they were civilians.
As true scouts, Denis and Marina had prepared emergency suitcases in advance, but they didn't manage to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
They didn't have their own car, and suburban buses were not taking anyone anymore.
At approximately 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first projectiles.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 pm on February 24th, people entered the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Is anyone there?" - I say yes. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, and if there were any weapons.
All men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even the military, young guys around 25-35 years old.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded the squad of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were lacking.
We say that water was a big problem with her.
They smashed the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is a video on the internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So after robbing the store, they brought the sausages and said, "We understand that it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful platter.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it was good that they came because they didn't want war, they support Ukrainians, and they are generally good: "Putin is a degenerate, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they didn't fight, but went to loot stores and maraud.
They brought a bunch of chickens, tied a St. George ribbon to one leg of one of them, and a white tape to the other, and called it "militia member."
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Bucha, so much so that they didn't even take their dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had assembled units - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were friends or foes.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk airborne troops.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the buildings - ours constantly hit them with "Bayraktars."
But these people came and told us that there are no more Armed Forces of Ukraine, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, there are about 100 thousand "Azov" in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a paratrooper officer or an FSB representative - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - there was information about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they gave us a "green corridor" too.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You are being taken to Belarus, and then, maybe, to Rostov."
We say that we don't want to go either here or there.
To which they replied: "Then take care of your children's mental health!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with "Grads" or mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor of our building.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not go, saying that it was for traitors of the homeland - as if, "you will be shot there, sold for organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burnt places, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians immediately export the equipment to them.
Very many bunkers, buried equipment, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we went through an improvised control, many people were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! A missile is fired, and you can see the trail - it's the "Iskander" working on Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these are planes flying, deploying at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Next, we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Venger Vasil Stepanovich, came and said, "Here, I am a Ukrainian, I am from Chernihiv."
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they finish off these thieves of yours.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
As he says, so it will be.
Offered interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representation (at least they called themselves that) spread disinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many people believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents - our daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, they didn't help us with anything, and at the Minsk train station, they said that without passports, no one will be allowed on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were both settled in Minsk and accompanied.
They didn't hold anyone by force at the sanatorium.
Our second group's migration representative said that you can stay here for a maximum of one to one and a half weeks because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles towards Ukraine: the missile first takes off, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
People who got on the bus in Mozyr said that Russians constantly shoot from the training grounds there.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are being discharged from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something of her son's if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, does not believe at all.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not realize that their training grounds are being used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting who took us to Estonia.
Right now we are going through registration, deciding what we will do next.
"In Estonia, there are probably just as many Ukrainian flags now as there are Estonian ones."
Marina lived in the territory of a military town in Gostomel together with her brother's family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to - the house is already gone.
Nobody really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, won't you be able to somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you as guests!
Thank you for the arrangement, the butterflies are beautiful.
And in this small apartment, there is no Wi-Fi, mostly I answer all your questions, and now I don't know what to do? And starting from Monday, the children have online classes, but there is no internet.
So I will be living with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?
In the Quran it is written: "even a leaf from a tree falls with His knowledge."
Our children are studying online, I am a salesperson and a cook by profession, but I can also work in the field and as a cleaner, meaning I am a handyman. Maryana is a specialist in eyelash extensions, she can work from home, while the other Maryana has no specific profession, meaning she is also a handyman.
Can we agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, the city mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the joyful news - Ukrainian military forces liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians had shot at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were killed right on the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the back of the head, some of the victims were minors.
The village elder of Motyzhyn, Olha Suhenko, her husband Ihor, and their son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olha and Oleksandr were in a mass grave, Ihor's - in the sewer.
On the side of the road, 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were discovered.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home.
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday it was supposed to be delivered to me, but no one contacted me and the package was not delivered, and on the DHL website it says that the recipient could not be found.
The package was sent to the post office for Tom and the address of this branch was indicated.
How can I pick her up?
When I was little, I could be by the river several times a day, as it was very close to the house, but now I rarely go there, as I don't have time and sometimes even desire. I only go with my sister. üôÇ
Please tell me, is this accommodation that you sent being rented by someone or what?
I was asked to go with my acquaintance's friends to an exhibition and help them arrange protection visas.
Almost spent the whole day. Got a little tired of people.
This is a nice house and we can maintain the order ourselves very well.
How to understand if there are free spots in the club or not
Russia will declare default on its external debt - reports CNN, citing the agency Standard & Poor's.
Good evening! I will leave at 20:00, will it be convenient for you?
They have well-organized distance learning at school, every day from 7 to 12, so he can study from home.
Only half fits, still can't fit another dryer.
I will be able to pay 12000 per month, preferably with fees included.
I hope there will be no problems. Thank you.
Can I ask for help with paying for school lunches for my daughter?
Understood... should I write it here or bring it written on a piece of paper tomorrow?
This story is spot on.
You see, we have something in common, we love to experiment with food üòä
Well, so that there was work and at least a store.
Good day, I have just been offered a job at a dentist's office in Prague, so thank you very much for your concern and I apologize.
She is very disrespectful and somewhat irresponsible.
She will either miss her stop, or forget her phone, or like now, not take her phone and not write to me that she's at school and everything is ok :)
And I worry about her because after all, she is not at home, but in another, not yet quite familiar country.
I hope that I found the math correctly.
You didn't think that I am still a child.
And of course, work is also interesting.
However, if not very physically fit, because I don't have such good physical shape.
I could pay for housing at a reasonable price if someone provided me with a room.
You communicate a lot, maybe you will know someone.
Good day, we are very interested in the job, but we do not speak Czech.
At what time can we give things to wash?
The charitable organization Archdiocesan Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, specifically in the city of Olomouc.
Can you imagine, Russians are raping women, and their children are forced to watch it.
Then they can also rape, mutilate the body, and all this is seen by children.
Good day, I am talking to you in my thoughts - I need to learn the Czech language, but I cannot tear myself away from the news.
I very often communicate with you in my thoughts. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, according to "European Truth."
All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, it is really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
On the question of whether Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, there would be no war, or it would look different.
It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
"But he was sure that there was no war after all," he added.
Reminder, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war has ended and to return home.
Please write to me about everything that will be needed.
I wanted to ask you if you know where the blender in our kitchen came from.
Destructive actions in the form of spreading fakes and disinformation are aimed at provoking panic moods and disorganization, which are sensitive to public safety.
I am from Ukraine, currently in Pilsen.
Before the war in Ukraine, I worked for 20 years as a designer of women's and children's clothing made from various materials, and I can also sew on special equipment and perform WTO (possibly referring to "–í–∏—Ä–æ–±–Ω–∏—á–æ-—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω—ñ—á–Ω–µ –æ–±–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—è" - Production and Technical Equipment).
I really want to work in my field, I am happy to share my knowledge and gain new experience in this industry.
Of course it's normal that you want to meet up. I was just joking.
Yes, it can be done this way too.
Today I read that they should log into the system themselves.
It is necessary to tell them this and do it with them.
Great, then I'll write tomorrow and we'll agree on the exact time.
Please send me photos of the examples you solved.
Is she a good deputy?
We went to this address to ask something about the school, maybe we needed some notebooks, maybe we got to the wrong place.
And a mother's prayer is the strongest.
I hear a lot - war on 10% of the territories of Ukraine.
Why do people run away?
Why don't people live in territories where there is no war?
Are you out of your mind?
Did you live in a warring state?
When the prices soared by 100-200%.
When the majority of enterprises DO NOT WORK.
When there is nowhere to earn money.
When do children hear air defense?
Did you live like this?
You can't even imagine.
And may God grant that they don't have.
If you find out too - it will be TERRIBLE.
That's why we run away.
Some of us are lost, with phones... that remained from our other life... yes, some did not adapt within a month.
And you could adapt from 0 in a month.
Yes, the state gives us 5000 crowns.
And could you live on these funds?
Many funds provide food.
Have you tried riding the metro with children in the funds?
When you look for food in one place, clothes in another, and there is not enough time to go to the third.
And tomorrow we have to go again... because the food they gave us is only enough for a day.
You WANT to provide for yourself... but what about the children??
How to live without knowing the language?
When you can't even ask for help.
So - there are free courses... but which one to choose?
Searching for a job, food, clothing, or courses?
I have more questions in a month than answers.
But my children cannot be there.
Just - understand us.
You come to the town hall, and at the reception downstairs you say that you are looking for Mrs. Krzhkovska, if they do not show you the way and the door number to her.
This will be written on his door, he is the head of the department.
If you cannot come to an agreement, call Dominik, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krzhkovska hasn't arrived yet, wait for her for a minute, she said she has a meeting beforehand, so maybe she will be a little late, but she knows about you, she scheduled you for this 9 o'clock appointment specifically so that you could make it to the doctor.
Yes, of course, it would be very nice to spend time together.
Please, cheer me up with a kind word, you are like a soothing thing for me...
It is easy to use and not expensive.
I really need the internet for work.
And how can you connect to the internet?
Maybe they have already taken someone, so they don't raise.
Good evening! Did we forget to write about those Czech language courses!?
We've already missed the first one üòâüôÑ
I feel a little sorry because I really understand how much I need it.
I never talked about relationships, never talked and never expected any relationships.
Zuzana, the doctor gave us these papers. Please help us write down what we need üòÖüòä
Okay, I'll wait, I'm going to sleep, good night üòò
You are surrounded by nature and cheerful neighbors)
I found accommodation but there is no furniture and dishes, could you help me find used furniture, thank you.
On the first day of illness, you can arrange a diet in clean brought dishes (food).
On other days, the State Consumer Service does not have the right to state-subsidized meals.
After the food is taken away, the kitchen staff is no longer responsible for its quality and health.
Hello. Martin, please check if the refrigerator is working.
We will meet her with great pleasure!
I really appreciate such support!
Anita also mentioned Friday today, suggesting to visit your center together with her and Anna after Anna's school.
An unexpected acquaintance at the beginning of hostilities with Polish brothers-in-arms turned into a good friendship.
It's very cool and pleasant to find like-minded people where you didn't expect and didn't look for them)
The bank will submit a loan application on Monday.
By the way, about the return.
Yesterday you said that you are ready to accept me as your partner. And as your partner, I don't want any money back.
What's mine is yours.
And you know it very well.
I will always be happy to make new acquaintances)
Because I am actually always unsure of my abilities, and I need such words!
We were home by 15:00. We went with Kristina and her family to the Vy≈°ehrad Castle.
I am at work all day tomorrow, until 12 at Fpoint, then I have English lessons, and in the evening I have to go to the language school office to get the keys to the cabinet.
Excuse me, please.
I kindly ask you, are you available on Thursday?
Thank you, today I feel much better üôèüèª
Went to the store with mom and sister.
Arrived, prepared food, had a conversation.
I went out into the yard to breathe some fresh air, did a little cleaning in the yard, because constantly being in the house can make you ü§™
If I had known, I would have gone with you.
According to the map, I saw that it was only 3 kilometers to their place.
I would even walk there, but I have to travel from Brno)))) Looking for a convenient route
It will be fine. Thank you. If the ultrasound shows something, then we will look at it.
We will be happy to visit you!
4. Besides schooling, what other types of activities would help your child adapt to the Czech environment? (leisure and education)
Okay, if something is found for me, it will be very good.
Write to the teacher to take a photo of her, so there would be a keepsake :)
Alright, thank you, then I will order for the whole week today, do I need to write the child's last name when ordering or not?
Any will do, do you have one?
Until the age of 21, I studied at the Law Academy in Kharkiv, and then went to work at the prosecutor's office.
My brother is supposed to come to help with the kids so I can go to work.
We had warm weather during the day, and a cold wind blew in the evening.
Why are you young and probably have a lot of girls?
In everything there are its pros and cons.
I have always wanted to visit Prague.
Grishko has already gone to kindergarten, but it's not that simple... He cries a lot.
Today a new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden.
I didn't even touch the door, and she's calling.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on some days for as many hours as I can manage.
If that's the case, then I will be able, for example, to work a few hours several days a week.
For how many hours exactly and on which days I will see how it will work out for me, so that I can also go to clean apartments, because they pay more for cleaning there, so I don't want to refuse that job either.
I am a water supply technologist, so I can immediately taste the flavor of the water.
She said there are inexpensive and delicious cakes there.
But overall, everything is good.
By the way, can I take tests these days?
I might go live in the evening if they let me go home for the night! You'll see me üòá
There are currently 3 of us (me and the children aged 3 and 17), maybe later my husband will move in with us, because for now he is staying in a dormitory.
How long do the courses last and what language level can be expected after completing them?
Great, so on Monday I am free.
And that would be very good for me.
I will prepare all the materials.
I have a great book where the Czech language is step by step.
I would really appreciate if it could be possible from 13:00-14:00, as I work until 12:30.
To make it in time to that place. Will it be so good?
None that came after the war. None that you didn't think of.
Answer me directly.
Do you want to be with me?
What do you feel towards me?
What can I do to convince you?
There you can be every weekend and not get bored.
Can you tell me how to get to the store?
So in the Czech Republic, there are very nice people, I came on vacation to my children aged 10 and 15 and grandmother (located in Marianske Lazne).
It is impossible to understand these women.
We offer free accommodation.
We live in a village in a large family house with a big garden and a closed courtyard between Jihlava and Havlickuv Brod.
We have 2 small children.
We provide a room.
The kitchen, bathroom, and other rooms are shared.
But first, a month of training, which will begin on April 13th.
On the website, there is a photo of a TV, please ask if it is available today and if we can come by.
He says that he is comfortable on the couch, don't worry.
If anything, we'll come up with something.
Thank you very much for your care.
We can meet often.
My husband can bring him to your house tomorrow or on Saturday, if that works for you.
No, he didn't call, the guys passed it along the chain. I know for sure that God is with him.
Ok, then we can go to the playground near the river.
There is a time for everything. If you don't have your own family now, it means that the time hasn't come yet. When it does, your family will be ten times bigger and closer than it would have been otherwise.
I can't download, I have an old phone. I don't speak German ((
I believe that they are looking for a confectioner who speaks English.
But in order for this document to be printed the way I made it, it needs to be downloaded to the computer first.
It should look like this.
Give us a vacuum cleaner for tomorrow so we can clean up.
And then you need to ask... it also depends on the weight and dimensions...
Thank you, we have already learned something similar.
Everything is good, went for a walk, got very tired.
So if no one can come, it won't be a problem?
I sent the documents to the email address.
Only in what status did we spend this joint time.....
There are regrets before myself, and there are many of them... And I can't hold back...
Can you prepare documents for us - an employment contract?
This robot is big, yellow, and strong. It is thirty-two years old.
Sent a second message to mom
Thank you, I need something, but I can't go anywhere now... I need to cook and learn words... Can we do it tomorrow at 9:30? We are registered for a course at 11 o'clock.
Marina, but really, if you need help with the garden, my husband and I will help.
My friend and I baked yesterday, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick, and they had symptoms, but we did not go to the hospital.
I just got a call from some woman from DameYdlo who said they emailed me information about further actions, but I never responded.
She spoke Czech and I understood her that way.
But I don't have an email from damejidlo in my inbox.
I need small pliers to tighten the gap on the plate.
Type or types of economic activity
We are looking for a housekeeper for regular cleaning of the house here, in the village.
Offer 150 crowns/hour.
Other cooperation according to satisfaction.
Agree on the date with the lady independently.
Of course, but I'm knocking you off your high horse.
Men also have a lot of nuances.
He was a very wealthy person, but he liked me because I had my own perspective on life. I met with him, then left him.
He was a very wealthy person, after some time he called and informed that he had a heart surgery.
After asking me to just talk to him and support him, I started to feel sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy person and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
There was a car in my yard, resembling a crocodile, and it was firing hail.
And they kept me in the house, then took me to the basement, and there were many people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
And as for the housing, what about the photos you sent?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already debunked this fake.
I will watch the last two videos when the internet is working properly.
Is there a dress code at work or not, and can you wear whatever you have?
Okay, he will go there and pick them up.
I am not greedy for everything.
I understand that I cannot sit with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propagandist channel, not interesting for me at all.
What happened at the bus stop with the man that the police and ambulance arrived? Is he alright?
Diana did not answer me and you.
Okay, I just need to print out coloring pages for the kids. So it will be fine. When can I come?
But maybe you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I worry that you will be satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but studies in the Czech Republic, majoring in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids calmly and with grandma.
I want you to be with me. To wake up next to you.
In general, it's hard to be in a foreign country, with each day the desire to go home grows stronger.
Mrs. Agata, if you need this photo, I will take a picture.
Thank you for trying your best to make our life here as comfortable as possible.
I will remember you for the rest of my life.
And I will remember and smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
So thank you very much Anna for setting up the route in the geolocation on the phone so that we could get there faster.
I need to pay the tariff, I must control it.
How can I see how much I am using?
And how do I pay?
I tell her that the "TV and radio repair" has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to blurt out anything extra when they call.
We've been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it's working.
However, in Plyamka (the cat - UP), the fur on the belly and hind legs has fallen out - this may be due to stress, a change in diet, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but unfortunately, the stress does not depend on me.
A stain, unlike a mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.
Thanks to the fact that Olga has poor hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in the apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
For 33 days, I lived with her in the apartment like a partisan.
They hid both the war and the fact that I was nearby from her - I formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend let it slip, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time, the mother-in-law spends in her room.
She hears poorly - this allowed me to be unnoticed by her.
If I heard the sound of her "footsteps", I would hide in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. That's 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything, just not about the war.
I will ask my girlfriend, she was there from the very beginning to the end.
On April 17th - I have to clean 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't even think about it :)
Hello, if our help is needed tomorrow, we will be able to come.
Do I have to order lunch, or can I bring lunch from home? Do I need to print these documents, or will they be printed there and I will sign them?
I offer men's, women's, and children's haircuts with a visit to your place, all interested please write in private messages, price:
I understand you and I'm not complaining, but in my situation, I will continue searching here for now.
I'm telling you, the embassy is only here.
A Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British man, who is a serviceman of the Marine Corps Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidan Aislin, a Briton who served in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, BBC citing family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News referring to the words of Aislin's friend who spoke with him.
Aislinn's literal tweet: "We received a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces."
We did not run out of food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate marine brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is participating in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of soldier En Wood, and she confirmed that her son informed her over the phone that they plan to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last phone call, Aislin spoke about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovtsy" squads without weapons and bullets.
Also, on social networks, an audio recording of a phone conversation was being shared, in which Aislin allegedly talks with her American friend who is planning to travel to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislinn said that they tried to leave the city in civilian clothes, but they were unsuccessful.
Earlier, the Briton reported that representatives of the private military company "Wagner" had threatened him on Instagram.
Eyslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the fights against the so-called "Islamic State" terrorists in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and took the oath.
Eyslina's friends and family called her Johnny, and on social media, she was more known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I would also like to know. Whether we are together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...
You offered to go with you, I agreed, if everything will be fine.
Thank you, we don't need anything for now, you have already done so much for us, we are very grateful to you.
If you ever don't want to write to me, I will wait.
Hello Natalia, please water the flowers outside, near the entrance doors. Thank you.
I would also like to learn the Czech language.
I would like you to take at least a little break and think about yourself.
Today, be sure to apply face cream)
Aha... I'm very grateful to you. I didn't even expect to meet such a person, I wish you health and good luck!!!!
Little Dushan is no longer shy?
Ondrej came to us with his father.
No one else came in, although there were many carolers walking down the street.
We are at home today.
The children were studying their lessons, now they are playing.
After lunch, I have to go to Lidl to buy groceries.
You have me.
You know that I love you.
I will do everything for you.
How can I prove this love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove everything to you.
Perhaps you have had many disappointments.
Allow me to make you happy.
Grandma won't be able to, her legs and lower back hurt a lot((
And how much does it cost to rent a two-room apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
The family is good, I have my mother, three brothers, and a husband left.
One brother is at war in Mariupol, the other is in Zaporizhzhia, and today my husband was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv.
They call every day saying that everything is fine, but who knows, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to sort out some things first. When
I will ask the man in the morning if he will make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I needed to communicate with Daniel.
The Bolshevik attackers took full revenge for their losses in battle.
They shot teacher Dmytro Pavlytsky, his unknown relative by name, and young Boris Oleksiyenko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep garbage pit, which was covered with earth."
According to the memories, "there was some kind of dead silence in the city."
Rarely did someone from the residents jog from house to house.
On the streets, one could constantly encounter bodies tortured by the Bolsheviks.
And maybe I will really follow you. I need you. I can't be without you.
3. What personal activity/engagement has helped you or your friends to better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't get there because there is a railway reconstruction here and the entrance is closed.
Get to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me that you have arrived, and I will come up to you.
The best future awaits us.
Can Lena give you the things that didn't fit us in size, or can she give them to Katya?
Yes, I stopped waking up in the middle of the night.
I just wake up very early in the morning without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4-5 hours now, but I'm already sleeping.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understood correctly, we will receive a letter from the school with login information to order the menu.
Okay, we will try to take us to the social services on Tuesday.
Then, when the filling cools down and the dough rises, we shape the pies and fry them on low heat in oil.
Okay, I will definitely ask him.
As soon as we settle in tomorrow evening, I will call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, really.
I am not afraid of robots, because I also lived in a village, so I can and love to work physically.
When can you bring the things?
Very interesting tradition you have, in our country people do this on Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted bill 7176, which is titled "On the implementation of monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economy."
It is surprising that the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory boards of state-owned companies and state banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in the conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the national security problems of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new threats to state-owned companies, but so far we do not know of any company that has had the need to physically hold a supervisory board meeting at the location address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it is a great basis for "destroying" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
Such, which was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take off as well - for example, the ProZorro public procurement system could be abolished or the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine could be undermined.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
So, on February 22, this regulation was included in the comparative table of bill 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's representatives for a long time.
Not because of the criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, let's analyze the arguments that explained the necessity of its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state enterprises during the war.
The First Deputy Minister of Economy, Denys Kudin, explained the necessity of such an innovation by the risks of losing the internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board may not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may result in the paralysis of the company's operations.
We agree that there is such a risk, however, can the relocation of supervisory board members to Ukraine prevent it?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, according to the bill, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law requires a competitive selection process, which on average takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by the bill 7176 is most likely not able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in its support.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, especially those in the defense-industrial complex (DIC), currently need relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna via Zoom."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned defense enterprises that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is perhaps in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-gratuitous basis.
The full authority in "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will make decisions regarding the necessity of relocating one or another defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism also because the bill 7176 does not introduce any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense enterprises.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts, at the first mention of the word "war" in 2021, leave Ukraine but remain members of the supervisory boards of Ukrainian state-owned enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from the war."
Firstly, it is manipulation - the majority of such supervisory board members have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically visited here.
To say that they are "leaving Ukraine," to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in global practice, and in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also worth remembering that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other activities as well, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
It is interesting, why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible temporary shelter options with a family. I have 2 children with me.

We usually require a passport from one of the adults.
In Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky, and Buchansky districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, an enhanced curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Direct speech of Pavliuk: "In the populated areas of Brovary, Vyshgorod, and Bucha districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!"
Restrictions will be in effect in the territory of these cities and villages from 21:00 on April 2nd to 06:00 on April 5th.
Details: According to the head of the regional state administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out onto the street during an alarm signal to go to a shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to eliminate the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine the territories.
Omelyanuk urged people who have left these areas to refrain from returning home for now.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will be in effect daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
No school has sent me anything yet, I only have a receipt for payment.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing in geometric progression for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested over two billion euros in the modernization of the army, updating military equipment, and purchasing modern systems, rising 22 places in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Just had to tell you that it broke.
I probably asked the question incorrectly.
Should I not take her with me, as the nanny services are designed for much younger children, or can I take her?
Using an official car and reimbursement of expenses
No, here where we were with Mr. Peter for dinner, we looked at this house, it suits us very much, we liked it a lot.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: Radio Svaboda, human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Hennadiy Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA".
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of the special forces "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one of them was wounded.
According to "Viasna", during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees received an injury and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be harshly stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "BZD" and an administrator of thematic resources "BZD" on "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
It is unknown where he is now and in what condition, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, in Belarus, no less than 40 railway workers were detained for sabotage.
Reminder: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus within the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "railway partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As is known, Russia transfers live forces and equipment through Belarus to fight in Ukraine.
This is for boosting self-esteem.
Do you like to read books?
And in phone mode, they also don't work on Easter holidays?
Can this be done by phone on any day or not?
Even a separate law was adopted regarding this issue.
We drove here for 4 days, so this is just a horror, not a road.
They were driving through the Kyiv region, the city of Irpin, and it was terrible there, shooting, sirens.
I worry about them too.
Silvia, Masha still hasn't received the funds from Kletsana, can we call them?
Yes, I will tell them, I think they will be at home.
There are different Muslims. There are fanatics, and there are truly believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted differently by various Muslims.
But honestly, it's very uncomfortable for me to do this for money.
You have done a lot of good for me.
I can do it for free.
Temporarily for the period while we are looking for a university, then of course permanent accommodation will be needed.
But maybe she will have a dormitory. (looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are currently not far from Prague, we have a car, and we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
City or village does not matter, it is desirable that it be a separate dwelling.
I accidentally clicked on something in Vodafone and connected two unnecessary promotions for which they took money, and I can't disconnect them üò≠
And it also took money from the card, on which there was none.
And I don't understand why the money was taken off.
The cost of the repair is paid by the owner = Mr. D—îdina. He has to appear on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, be at home and wait for the repairmen.
May I ask you for one cigarette?
Can we change the mobile plan if you have time? Or is it already too late?
The US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, while Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
This step is based on the decision made by over 600 transnational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retail traders, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms," according to a White House statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the US involved restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets within the jurisdiction of the United States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list on the following day, Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of Putin's adult children, his wife, and the daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the ex-president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the road is closed further and I will come to you.
Vera, can we already wash the dishes in the machine?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp company, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, and my little son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but we never even thought that we would be forced to flee because we no longer have the strength to hide in the basement.
I was lucky and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that someone will shelter us for the first time) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but only if it is within our budget.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We do not have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help during this difficult time for us.
After lunch, I had one English lesson and after it, I also went to work in the children's room.
I explained to Margarita there how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understood everything and will do everything well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought the announcement from the pool.
This is free swimming.
Can you call the school? Kira is not answering the phone, I don't know if she made it to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stopping investments and ceasing supplies.
However, we did not understand each other.
In our house, the military did not settle in.
Our house is located near the military unit and the oil depot.
He just helped me because I wouldn't have managed on my own.
I cook deliciously, don't ask unnecessary questions, and give good advice.
I can handle it myself.
It's a bit difficult for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
We will meet on Thursday and I will tell you everything.
Overall, everything is good.
I walk, how often do you clean?
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have the program, but I will try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls cannot move anywhere right now, so I did not write to the house owner.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear any information about housing, please let me know.
I would gladly rent a place with some decent girl.
If you happen to know such a thing, let me know.
On my part, I won't let you down.
Thank you in advance.
Natalia, 54 years old, has not written to you yet. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I did not change my last name, I have had the same one since birth :)
Good day, Mr. Reyrarde! I'm sorry, I didn't see it. I will do it right now and send it to you immediately.
We will go to the medical examination now.
So, Anya needs to make up for this hour on another day.
On which day is it better for her to come earlier? (Maybe on which day there is a little more work?)
I will finish listening tomorrow, the internet is working poorly. Good night.
What are you going to do now?
Thank you .. we found something among the things, but there was nothing from the equipment...
Both beginners, apart from the alphabet, know nothing.
Nothing is happening.
Is Monday, 04/25 possible?
Children can be taken with you, there are enough toys here :)
Guessed about dad
Perhaps I am very naive or very much in love, but I will figure something out with this money.
We will somehow do it.
But how will it be paid, please, no credits.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
I am your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't even know anymore.
Do I need to take the clothes that were given with me?
Today is not my day. The blinds in the living room broke. One in the morning, and another one in the evening.
Something came from you, I don't see what.
I am also very sad.
I will remind you about the invoice later.
Only your dad speaks and understands Russian?
On which day does the colleague want to do the house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed that I am distracting you from your affairs.
Good evening, I cannot help but share with you. There is news from Mariupol about my son - he is alive and well.
I recommend reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuronal connections.
On the morning of April 12, journalist Natalia Nagorna of the "1+1" TV channel published a video recording that was given to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and there are many wounded.
They said that "the countdown is going by hours."
Before this, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which is participating in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks, there was skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defensive operation should not be a subject of public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the "Azovstal" plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the "Azovstal" plant, which is held by the fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good.
The situation is the same, for now we stay here.
2 hours of driving)) walks, mom shopping and back)!
That's not an important matter.
She forgot what to do here.
A squadron of Czechüá®üáø drones began flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional dronesüöÅ will serve for detection, and some of them - for the direct destruction of the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech "bird" brothers were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday, thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council, Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their Mizhhirya friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones to their destination: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian military in various cities where hostilities are currently taking place.
With the aim of maximizing the effective and safe use of drones, their deployment locations will be kept secret for now.
Four friends from the Czech Republic who are helping the Ukrainian army do not plan to stop, they say: in the coming days, they will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them.
I'm worried that we won't make it. A lot of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine to continue working.
Okay. If everything is fine, I will agree.
I will try to do it myself, but if there are any problems, can I write to you?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally at the village elder's house in Lviv, she saw me and that I am pregnant but said that there is no housing available.
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will improve.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I also got cold on the street.
Took the medicine and tea, feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I'm curious about your musical preferences üòä
Mom and dad should be listened to.
You will find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler here and rain. Tomorrow it should be warm already.
But it's not a pity for the ruined houses, it's a pity for the people who are being abused by the occupiers.
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown individuals tore off the European Union flag, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down the portraits of the Heavenly Hundred heroes and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the carol, we don't have such a tradition so we didn't know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, maybe we should have given something else.
In Czech, there is someone to talk to, if necessary.
Because I live in a dormitory, there will be people here until twelve, and then they go to work.
Hello is already a little better.
Today I have already been to the nursery.
Even today he was already asleep there.
That's why we already have great great progress.
I will definitely bring vareniki next time!
Today I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I am pushing away from the days and time when there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can roughly say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
In the month of May - I can approximately say at the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you guys are talking about it at all.
Hello, sorry for not responding for a long time, I was preparing dinner and took a little nap.
If you don't mind, could I come over today?
Either we'll meet after your arrival)
He is modest with us, lately he has been studying a lot. He understood that it is very necessary for him in life.
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a bit shocked that I work with people in such high positions.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the economics department of the Highlands region.
She was very satisfied with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the nursery.
On Monday, I have to bring confirmation of employment and also pay in cash for the kindergarten.
I've been lazy since Friday.
I'm not doing anything, just eating a lot and sleeping üòÇ (and drinking a lot of water ‚òùüèª)
If tomorrow you are going to the doctor, I would go with you if possible.
I have to bring one more analysis.
But then you won't have to go again.
The flush tank works very poorly, it flushes badly. A master is needed. It needs to be adjusted.
So there is enough of everything there.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have signed up for.
And do they feed the children there or do we need to bring food with us?
And now for a moment, can I come to you with one question?
If you need help, feel free to write.
If I'm not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't really want you to raise funds, so that people wouldn't think we were speculating on this!
But for online completion, two points were not enough for me.
I will go to rest. To gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night.
üòÑüòçWhat a wonderful idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be great because the whole family will be painting.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully verify any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors, and gossip.
Rely only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army.
Collected several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, they have to set up the internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How will the day I was absent from work be counted if I have a pass?
Headquarters report: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine.
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation may carry out provocative actions in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for actions in the Sloboda direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to carry out the preparation and deployment of personnel, weapons, and equipment for participation in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyrishche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the specified weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borz, Trans-Baikal region), the 29th general military army of the Eastern Military District is recruiting servicemen from the mentioned brigade.
The enemy faces a particular problem in staffing the positions of drivers and driver-mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the areas of combat operations, will continue strikes on transport infrastructure objects in the territory of Ukraine with the aim of their destruction or disabling.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Sloboda direction, separate units from the 6th General Military Army and the coastal forces of the Northern Fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, with artillery shelling of individual districts of the city ongoing.
On the Izium direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues with the aim of detecting the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With the forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to launch an offensive in the directions of the populated areas Dovgenke and Dmitrivka, but was unsuccessful and retreated to the previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the populated areas of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault actions in the Zolote area, but was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault actions in the areas of the "Azovstal" plant and the seaport.
By the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of populated settlements Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka, and Maryanske.
In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian defenders repelled four enemy attacks in the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored vehicles, six units of automotive equipment, and eight enemy artillery systems.
Did not understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it in time, but I have doubts.
And how can you sleep if you want to, but I'm holding you back?
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to meet today, just tell me, I will understand everything)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set it up :)
I turn on the TV here exclusively for the purpose of listening to the Czech language.
My monthly tariff package ends today :)
Can we do this today over the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads.
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I will ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
We will definitely meet with my father later üôèüèª
I read the announcement on Facebook, so maybe Google wrote something in its own wayüèµÔ∏è. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we took the things you brought, but there are some items that are too small for us, can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If it suits the director, I can start going to work from next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if possible, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it will rain :)
Looking for a team at the beginning, really liked chemistry in school, learning Czech language to know it perfectly, dreaming of working at Teva.
Old friends and not so old, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
During the last month, I have communicated with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you admitted that you feel guilt and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what they subject Ukraine to on your behalf.
The threat has been hanging over some of you activists for a long time, and you were preparing for the decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial."
I'll tell you a bit later, - as usual, Sasha replied laconically. - Now we're walking through the ruins after the search.
Others, however - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, the majority of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", "Novaya Gazeta", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organization, and a number of other places - how many of you have done at least something to resist this regime?
Except maybe for participating in rallies when they still took place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-standing indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which now, most likely, weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
It was not always like this.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy - chaotic, even bloody, but genuine.
But the year 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are ultimately overcome by such a strong fear of chaos that you seek salvation behind the back of a tsar, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still feel safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you focused on the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to lie low, renew itself, reorganize, and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the plundering of the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly reconciled with the plundering.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern became survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you fell for it, but you still either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Kale, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would return to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I had witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about the killed children, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Breda, we are already fed up with your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya."
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
"It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeroes, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started to earn well, some have become rich, and even the poorest among you have acquired new housing and found better jobs.
Prices were rising, but is that really a problem?
Moscow shone festively and sparkled with chic.
When several opposition figures ‚Äì Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko, and others ‚Äì were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, things didn't go any further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev and took the position of prime minister himself, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you either ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West probably didn't do much, if we did anything at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia was blatantly violating international law when there was such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin once again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidential seat, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively went out to protest.
Navalny's name became a rallying cry, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and finally, the regime felt with horror that it was losing ground.
After that, he struck back in response.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Someone received huge terms.
And what could we have done?
I've heard this so often and still hear it.
The state is so strong, and we are so weak.
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once captured Maidan - and never left it again.
They independently set up a tent camp and prepared for a determined defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves using sticks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the offensive.
Many have perished, but they have triumphed.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do a poor job.
Maidan really displeased Putin.
This was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little benefit from it.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to worship him.
It is difficult for me to find the reason, as we stopped communicating immediately after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid in new books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks, completely new after the restoration that the Moscow mayor started in 2012 - with their beanbags, public Wi-Fi, and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I supposedly didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least, I've been there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs, government snipers cold-bloodedly shoot at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers have been there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of peaceful residents, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
First they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense.
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Someone among you did this.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are really speaking now - like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
The majority allows themselves to speak from abroad, while some, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risk ending up in a new GULAG or joining Navalny from within the country.
As for the others, you know best in which country you live.
So, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he fails - he will come after you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went to the protests and so far have served a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or who spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when you could get 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment just for a joke are not so far in the past - and now, with a high probability, they are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight against it.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage may seem on paper.
Considering everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is an ongoing war.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be prepared.
You understand where all this is going.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a joke, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, there are no more free media left, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to leave somehow or be crushed.
I doubt that you see any other option.
And yet, there is still one left.
Which will ultimately bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, under the circumstances that have arisen, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: due to the economic collapse looming over Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city will hold rallies on its own, as it has periodically happened before, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them individually.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was crushed, but it is possible to create others, more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, there are millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, possibly even a hundred thousand.
If it exceeds 300 thousand, she will be astonished.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to business?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
If I were in your place, I would be scared too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their master, who dare not only to demand freedom but to truly try to achieve it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat ‚Äì and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the internet ‚Äì and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äì and will die in a Syrian cell under police batons.
Here is what has been happening for many years - and will continue to intensify, gaining larger and larger scales.
You also have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act calmly, think strategically, and achieve making it a reality.
We were at the class on Friday, and we were told that we could come on Monday.
In the evening we will be at home.
How do you perceive me as a press secretary?

I am waiting for new news from her and will definitely inform.
While working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity for the lost time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but monogamous and take the issue of marriage seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.

Mr. Reichard, I apologize for disturbing you during non-working hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalia's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
When the children were going home, one mother refused to pick up her child because she said she came to look at the things and arrange them in that room with clothes, and Mr. Valeriy opened our children's room for her until 19:00 yesterday.
Can it really be so?
The working hours of the room are until 16:00.
And ultimately, it is our responsibility.
But I can't load or open the page because the internet is very weak.
Good day, everything is fine with us) Kolya is working, yesterday we filled out the invitations, and I was busy with the older ones before the exam at the gymnasium.

We will try our best to collect the maximum amount by the end of the week in order to settle up.
