When I tried to purchase an entry package, blue and orange packages appeared.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What is the difference?
I couldn't find out even after researching, so please teach me.
Now, there should only be blue ones.
If there are any, it might just be leftover old products.
They may look different, but they are both the same.
Karate vs. Jiu-Jitsu
Which one is stronger if they fight with the same height and weight?
Jiu-jitsu
In general, karate only involves practicing fighting against other karate practitioners.
Jiu-jitsu, especially Brazilian jiu-jitsu, is practiced with elements such as dealing with strikes.

In "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny," was the Destiny Plan just Durandal's act of spite after being rejected by Talia?
Due to genetic incompatibility, I couldn't have children and broke up with Talia, so is the gene really that accurate?

Because there's stuff like that, I just don't feel like watching TV anymore...
So, does that mean it's impossible for comedians? There are so many comedians on TV.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but there were quite a few scenes where the staff laughed out loud in the background even when she wasn't saying anything particularly interesting.
Even though it's clearly not funny, there's something creepy about the forced laughter of "I have to laugh at everything they say because they're a popular comedian."
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it would probably upset the comedian's mood, and it would be bad for work relationships.
It seems like that industry is like the old black companies, with a strong sports club-like atmosphere, and some entertainers have such big egos that they have a nasty attitude, so they probably can't make a living without doing that.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of cases where comedians themselves exaggerate the difficulty of their job, constantly saying things like "don't underestimate comedians."
I know that the income is quite low until you start selling, but even if you tell me that being a comedian is like standing at the top of the most difficult professions, it doesn't really matter.
It sounds like nothing more than a justification for the glorification of one's own career and the overly high status of comedians in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough aspects in the industry I work in, but I feel like things related to the world of comedians are becoming increasingly difficult.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
It felt like it's not good for the body if you don't let it out like a fart...

Online shopping for Ikemoto Brush Industry
Hairbrushes available!
A sample will be presented to the purchaser.
The product I ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a discounted wireless mouse, but received the wired version instead, and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
It's more about online shopping trouble than the topic of custom-built PCs, but I can't help but feel dissatisfied, and since it's a famous place, I'll write about it here.
I found that the MSI wireless gaming mouse was on sale for 3,280 yen at the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day Sale, which started last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I considered the possibility of a price mistake and checked the wired version's page, which was 5,071 yen (link to the archive), so I thought it might not be a mistake and placed an order.
The order email arrived normally, and the next day shipping email also arrived.
In these two emails and the purchase history on My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
At this point, I thought the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive, as there were no mistakes in communication or cancellation notices from the time of order to shipment.
The problem starts from here, as I received an email saying "there was a mistake in the product registration" a few hours after the shipment.
According to that email,
The wireless version was on sale at a special price, but it was actually the wired version.
We have already shipped the wired mouse.
1. Refuse to accept and cancel everything.
2. Return only the mouse for a refund.
3. Continue to use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose the response.
The product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separate, and the purchase history, emails, and delivery notes all say "wireless version," but it seems they arbitrarily replaced it with the wired version and sent it.
Isn't it terrible that they sent a different item without my consent, and if I want a refund, they're telling me to send it back from my end?
Please lend me your wisdom, as I want to strike back at least once even if I eventually accept the refund.
Would you not want to date someone who has a bad relationship with their family, assuming you were looking for a marriage partner or searching for a partner?
Is it unrelated?
If you care, why is that?
For example, it refers to people who have cut ties with their parents, siblings, and other family members.
I don't particularly mind.
The reason for bad relationships can be various personalities and unreasonable people, whether they are parents or siblings.

Isolated twice... The only bridge connecting the area washed away by typhoon and heavy rain, residents tripled their stockpile of food in Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Koro Matsumoto from Takachiho area, Yamatsuri town, Fukushima prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a significant impact on the lives of 8 people in 3 households.
Mr. Matsumoto Yoshiro: "At first, it's like, 'Are you serious?'"
"It felt like, is it going to break so easily, is it going to be washed away?" The only road connecting to the Takahara district, the "Takahara Bridge," was washed away by the typhoon in eastern Japan, leaving 11 households and 30 residents in the area isolated.
The residents who were forced to cut off water continued to carry necessary supplies daily using the JR railway bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass.
Matsumoto Yoshio-san: "Usually, cars can come up to the garden, but when you get off the car over there, you have to carry it in your hand or on your back, cross the iron bridge, and walk all the way here, so I felt the importance of transportation and cars." The temporary bridge that was completed a month later was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and it was isolated again for several days until a provisional bridge was built.
It has been over two years since the disaster, and although recovery has progressed, Mr. Matsumoto continues to implement measures that take advantage of the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto Yoshiro: "I think there are about 10 cases."
For the time being, I thought I'd like to secure at least 2-3 days' worth of food, so I prepared about three times as much canned food and cup noodles as before the disaster, which can also be used as emergency food.
Matsumoto Misako-san: "It's not someone else's problem, and since we don't know when a disaster will strike us, I felt once again that everyone should have at least a little stockpile." On the other hand, Yagisaki Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" where a bridge was washed away.
In order to not forget the lesson, we started a unique initiative in the town from 2021.
Yamatsuri Town Education Division Chief Ryuuichi Takahashi: "We have established 'Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and announced that we would like to make October 12th a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards."
"I think the awareness of the possibility of unexpected events happening has increased more than ever before."

Painful...
Are there really parents who kick out their children?
I don't understand the meaning.
I wonder if there isn't a reliable place in administration or something like that.
It seems like there might be support groups or something if you look for them, but... I don't know anything about it... Sorry.
However, as far as I can remember, in Hiroyuki's video, he mentioned something like, if a person with a bad relationship with their parents goes to an organization that provides food, clothing, and shelter, even if they are told not to come, if they go anyway, the organization will somehow help them (I vaguely remember). So, it seems like there might be such organizations.

"The pitfalls of the 'building condition survey system' (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News"
In order to revitalize the used housing market, the newly established "building condition survey" system is boosting used housing transactions.
Both single-family homes and condominium prices are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire for owning a home is increasing due to the coronavirus pandemic, popularity is concentrated on properties represented by words such as "station-front", "near-station", "directly connected to the station", "large-scale", and "tower", which are soaring in price. This is also likely to be affected by the sharp decrease in relatively affordable new properties.
[View the image of this article] However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing circulation in Japan is still at a low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and started a building condition survey, commonly known as an inspection, aimed at ensuring safe and secure transactions of used houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect familiar with residential properties checks the current condition of the property, including its deterioration, and the condition of the building, and presents a report to the buyer after summarizing the findings.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after the handover and provide a sense of security to the buyer by conducting a property investigation before the sale transaction.
It is said that this could ultimately lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used house they plan to purchase and to buy it with confidence, and at first glance, it seems to be a system with significant benefits.
Under the current system, the main authority to conduct building condition surveys lies primarily with the seller side.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of mediation has an obligation to explain that they can either "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey during property mediation" or "cannot do so," but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
In a seller-led inspection, there are concerns about risks. On the other hand, when looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in countries with active used markets, such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the preliminary stage of buying and selling a house, the buyer requests a building inspection from a professional called an "inspector" or "building surveyor."
For example, in the case of the United States, depending on the state, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used housing transactions.
In the aspect that the "buyer" leads the inspection, it greatly differs from the "seller"-centric Japanese-style inspection in nature.
The seller tries to make the building's condition look as good as possible, and sell it as high and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer side carefully examines the survey content and wants to live with peace of mind by applying appropriate repairs.
Even if it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy in the purpose and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection set by the country is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking truly important defects. ● For inspection companies, intermediary companies (sellers) who introduce responsible cases can also be considered as customers.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection that "considers" the seller, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results, may be conducted.

It was pretty tough.
However, mentally I was healed (?), so I was full of motivation.
My body couldn't keep up and I used to fall asleep at work because I had a research job.
Since it was the second time in a year, I thought I'd take a break for about a month and say goodbye to the shitty company, but it turned out to be more severe than I thought and the medicine didn't seem to work, so it took longer.
Anyway, it's important to see a psychiatrist and have them deal with it properly, and to leave a record of your outpatient visits (super important).
If you have a history of going to the hospital, even if you leave the company due to personal reasons, it can be changed to leaving the company due to company reasons at Hello Work based on the doctor's judgment, so the hurdle to receive unemployment insurance and so on becomes significantly lower.
Even if it's hard to find a job and you want to take a break, you can still have financial and emotional leeway.

Ginza was an island?
5 Selected Trivia You Can Talk About While Wearing Silver Bra (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
You know, this place used to be a peninsula back in the day.
As evidence of that, being able to show off a little trivia like "..." is unique to Ginza.
We will introduce interesting trivia about Ginza that you'll want to know and surely share with someone.
Go above Ginza!
First infiltration into Ginza
While walking around Ginza, you can find traces of its history everywhere, such as unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines that have been engraved on the land of Ginza.
While walking with her in Ginza, I suddenly said in the silence, "You know, this place used to be a peninsula."
Ginza used to be a peninsula?
The symbol of bustling downtown areas that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan, "Ginza" in Chuo Ward, Tokyo.
To begin with, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (the 17th year of Keicho), the Ginza office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was relocated to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shin-Ryogae-cho," but when it moved to Kakigara-cho, it became known by the nickname "Ginza."
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.
Before the Edo period, there was an inlet from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomaeshima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of that peninsula corresponds to the present-day Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and advanced the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the city blocks and dug moats around them to promote the development of water transportation.
And they dug a moat and cut down Kandayama, filling in the inlet with the excavated soil.
By the way, there is a stone monument indicating the site of the former Ginza Town Hall, called "The Birthplace of Ginza," in front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7). If you're interested, why not try to find it?
The "holy pilgrimage" of Ginza, known only to those in the know.
In Ginza, there is an annual event called "Ginza Haccho Shrine Tour," which is a lesser-known "sacred pilgrimage" known only to those in the know.
Among more than 10 sacred sites, the most noticeable one is probably the "Kabuki Inari Shrine" located in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine on the right end of the Kabuki-za, there are not a few people who visit before and after watching the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudo Myo-o" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizo" is on the 9th floor Ginza Terrace of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Houtou Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located deep in the alleys and are not easily noticeable, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimaru Uzaemon. The "Success Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is not open to the public except during the Yachou Shrine tour.
In this shrine tour, there are places that enshrine Fudo Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu, but most of the shrines have Inari as their main deity.
In front of the shrine hall, a fox welcomes you at the "Inari Shrine," which is often built in areas with many farmers, as it is believed to bring the blessing of "bountiful harvest" for good rice crops.
As a result, in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, it became said that there were benefits to thriving businesses, and faith spread even in Ginza, the most prosperous district in Japan.

Two days ago, I started experiencing a sharp pain in my front teeth, similar to hypersensitivity when I press or touch them, so I went to the dental clinic.
The nerve has been removed and the hole is left open.
They said it was to relieve the pain quickly.
Before the treatment, touching my teeth causes severe pain, but will it subside in a few days?
The painkillers don't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.

Recruitment: How to compile scripts & how to modify existing MOD scripts
I tried my best and looked at various things, but I just couldn't figure out how to do it.
I tried using an app specifically for launching from MO2 because I don't want to move the script source and resources, but I don't know how to use the tool.
I went through the entire CKWiki tutorial, but it only covers how to create completely original mods.
I just want to modify the script of an existing MOD and recompile it... Why can't I find a way to do that...

Since the military itself is an organization of the state, those who are conscripted can be considered as national civil servants in terms of the organization.

A man's body found in Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
Before noon on the 12th, a man was found lying face down and dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the man's identity, cause of death, and other details.
According to the police, at around 11:30 am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidami, Moriyama Ward, and called 110 to report it.
The man was rescued from the river, but it was confirmed that he died on the spot.
The police are urgently confirming the identity and investigating the cause of death and other factors.
On the other hand, in Fukuoaka-cho, Okazaki City, a man in his 70s was found lying in the Sandagawa River, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disorder in the man's clothing, but it is said that a bicycle was lying nearby.
The police are urgently verifying the person's identity and investigating the situation at the time.
In mid-February, there is a benefit payment for households exempt from the residential tax. If there is one person exempt from the tax in the household, will the benefit be provided?
It seems that the confirmation documents will be sent from today, but...

South Korea's POSCO International acquires Australia's Senex Energy, expanding overseas gas field business, according to South Korean media (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on the 12th that it has signed a stock purchase agreement with Australia's Senex Energy and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy for the acquisition of Senex Energy.
Currently, the procedures such as the approval at the Senex Energy's shareholders' meeting and the approval of the local corporation are still pending, and the acquisition process is expected to be completed by March next year.
This acquisition is the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case for Posco International since it was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition amount is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy decided to invest 49.9%.
Posco International explained that they decided on this acquisition because they believe that the demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and in the hydrogen market, blue hydrogen based on natural gas will share the market with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operation personnel in Australia.

That knee pain might be "osteoarthritis of the knee"! ?
Treatment methods vary depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial department: Recently, the knee pain has been continuing.
What kind of illnesses could there be?
Professor Maruyama: The causes of knee pain can vary, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, "osteoarthritis" is common in Japanese people.
Editorial Department: Does it mean that the joints will become deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joints is covered with cartilage, which serves to cushion impacts and ensure smooth joint movement.
However, factors such as aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause the cartilage to wear down or become distorted.
As a result, it leads to deformation and inflammation of the joints.
Editorial Department: Can osteoarthritis occur in joints other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and roots of the fingers, neck, lower back, big toe, hip joint, and so on.
However, the most common cases occur in the knee, and are called "osteoarthritis of the knee."
Editorial Department: First of all, what kind of structure do joints have?
Mr. Maruyama: Joints are formed by the combination of two bones with uneven surfaces.
And the part where these two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage," and the area around the joint is wrapped in a "joint capsule."
Editorial department: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right, isn't it?
Inside the joint capsule, there is a tissue called synovial membrane, which produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that "to make the movement of the knee smooth, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good."
Editorial Department: What kind of symptoms occur when you develop osteoarthritis?
Professor Maruyama: Articular cartilage has viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
In a sense, it plays a role like a cushion.
However, if this wears down or becomes distorted, it can cause joint deformity or inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basic pajamas, but when my pajamas are being washed, I wear sweatpants or something and sleep!
Even heavy smokers, there are people who can quit smoking and those who cannot, right?
That's right, there are two types.
I used to know someone who was a heavy smoker, but they quit completely.
Somehow, they thought, "Maybe I should try quitting..." and it seems they just quit like that.

"3 Selected Gambling & Games from the 'Kaiji' Series that You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The "Kaiji" series, a gambling manga boasting explosive popularity, mainly among men.
One of the highlights of this work is a game of extreme limits where lives are at stake.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes your legs freeze... Challenging the steel beam crossing!
So this time, I would like to examine the games of Kaiji that can actually be played or are demonstrated in planning videos.
Swamp: It's the "Swamp," a pachinko machine full of traps that appeared in "Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji."
In the original work, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball astonished Kaiji.
In this "swamp," there were large traps such as "Nail Forest," "Movable Props," and "3-Tier Crune," making it almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every possible method, and in the end, he resorted to the extreme measure of placing a vinyl water tank on the building to sink the foundation and tilt it, successfully capturing it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually made its appearance as a pachinko game, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball," and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you can still experience the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Star Side Party" held by a rich person as an entertainment, the debtors, including Kaiji, were made to participate in a "human horse race" called the steel frame crossing.
The debtor proceeds on a narrow steel frame set up 10 meters above the ground, devising not to fall, and competes for speed.
12 people participate, and the top 2 can win prize money, but there are only 4 steel bars, and safety measures are insufficient, so the possibility of dying is quite high.
This steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game, and you can have a very similar experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles' home stadium, "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi."
This Eagle Bridge has a steel single bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and beyond that, the "Sky Blanco" and "Victory Single Bridge" are prepared, and you walk towards them.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Koala Kourai posted a video on his own YouTube channel walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming that "you can experience walking on steel beams in Japan," which became a topic of conversation.
E-Card: A two-player card game, "E-Card."
Use a total of 10 cards: 1 emperor card, 8 citizen cards, and 1 slave card, and play by dividing into the emperor side and the slave side.
This game is very well made and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the story, Kaiji faces Tonegawa in a fierce battle with the rule that "if he loses, his own ear will be cut off."
After a great struggle, Kaiji realized that his thoughts were being read through a device attached to his ear like an earphone, which detected and transmitted changes in his pulse and body temperature. In order to confuse Tonegawa and win, he shaved his own ear to the extreme and made his body's values abnormal.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on sites like Amazon.
On YouTube, a video of popular YouTuber Hikaru competing in E-card with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, has been uploaded and has attracted attention.
How about trying to experience the Kaiji feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it's a fact that reading the manga makes you want to experience the feeling.
How about experiencing the world view through the game?
A step towards the New Year, gently pushing forward: A large votive picture tablet of the tiger at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
At the Ken Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema (wooden plaque) featuring the zodiac sign "Tora" (tiger) for next year's Eto (zodiac cycle) has made its appearance.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of Art and Design who designed it visited the shrine, and a ceremony was held in front of the deity.
The shrine has been commissioning art students to create the original drawings for the votive tablets since the year before last.
This time, a work by Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student in the Japanese Painting course led by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga, was selected from the works created by nine students.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and the center height is approximately 1.8 meters.
Mr. Tsuchiya said that he drew it with an image of "cherry blossoms gently pushing the back as we step into the new year."
The figure of a tiger stopping and gazing at cherry blossoms embodies the wish to "be able to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world."
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on ema that are distributed to the general public.
Chiba Kenichi (44), a Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help everyone overcome their difficulties."

"Let's think about 'Tamano, where we want to continue living': Four high school students in the city propose a workshop: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San Digi"
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano, a place we want to continue living in."
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai-zukuri Center", they will compile the raw voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor and others.
"When do you have fun?"
In response to the facilitator's question, the students answer in chorus, "When getting excited with many people," "When playing the drums," and so on.
The first meeting was held at Hinode Fureai Hall on November 13th.
18 high school students and local residents discussed and thought about "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns where you can feel a sense of purpose" by moving around "islands" with predetermined themes using the "World Café" method.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and organize them on a piece of imitation paper.
"It seems like a town with many young people would be interesting" "For a place to be easy to live in, transportation such as trains and buses is essential."
There may be no common ground, but let's continue discussing further.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the seaside is attractive," said an 18-year-old third-year student at Tamano Commercial High School.
A Binan High School third-year student (18) said, "There are few shops and the transportation is inconvenient, but the rich nature is nice." It seems that they realized not only the regional issues but also the charm by talking with adults.
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered and organized the content of the proposals.
The plan is to hold a presentation in February next year, inviting the mayor, the superintendent of education, and others.
The director of the center, Rie Higashi, said, "We hope to nurture high school students' love for their hometown and provide an opportunity for young people to actively engage in community building."

How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is essential in winter, but isn't there a time when the fabric bunches up around your neck?
After rolling it up, it's good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear people say they don't quite understand the trick.
I was thinking that if there was a stole that could be wrapped quickly without the fabric bunching up, and then I found something innovative.
The "COTTORI" brand stole has a longer side of about 1 meter, making it a more compact size than typical ones.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it really be wrapped so short?"
Upon closer inspection, it is made by weaving long, narrow strips of fabric together into a single piece, and the overall appearance is that of a mesh.
The mesh is designed to allow the edge of the stole to pass through.
Therefore, you can wrap and secure it without tying the ends together.
Made of fleece material, it is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless jackets (vests) are popular, but many people wear them with a stole to keep their shoulders from getting cold.
I think having a stall like this would definitely be convenient.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super interesting.
It's the one directed by Peter Jackson called Get Buck.
It feels fresh in various ways, like a life-sized Beatles, or should I say, very vivid...
It's tense because it's just before disbanding, but it's not the dramatic tension I had imagined.
While trying hard to manage, there's the annoying Paul who's like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!", the somewhat whiny George who goes "But, you know~", the seemingly unmotivated John who calmly gives opinions and jokes but is always late, and even the peacemaker Ringo doesn't actively intervene, just sitting in the back with a "What a bother" expression on his face.
It's like, they don't hate each other enough to fight, but there's a strong sense of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles had that kind of vibe too, like the legendary disbandment or something like that.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance begins, everyone is truly overflowing with talent.
The process of turning a simple phrase into "that masterpiece" by each other saying "How about this?" is crazy.
The moment when the title track "Get Buck" is completed is amazing, especially.
The scene where the casual humming gradually turns into that "Zucha♪ Zucha♪" and the lyrics come in is well documented and amazing.
It's amazing to be able to see the process of composing music like this, as it's not something you get to see very often.
Well, it's obvious, but everyone is really into it, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems to be only the first episode out of three, but so far, the impression is that the main reason for the Beatles' breakup was more due to the surrounding environment than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them seem to enjoy making music together despite their complaints, but when it comes to deciding on a live venue, producers and promoters start saying things like "The Beatles are the best in the world!" and it becomes clear that the situation is out of their hands.
Well, since documentaries also involve the director's interpretation, it might be that Peter Jackson felt that way and it's coming across...
I thought that the reason why there are many scenes where Paul seems like a villain might be because Paul is supervising it.

I thought that perhaps because of their serious personality, they feel a sense of responsibility and gradually lose their peace of mind and other things.
Now, you can't help but think that living is a little bit tough, right?
I used to work in sales and was extremely stressed, so I changed jobs. At that time, I realized that I was not good at initiating sales activities on my own, but I was very suited for sales activities where customers needed me. So, I chose a job in a different industry that involved that kind of work, and it became much easier for me to work.
Although you were told that you couldn't do it, I think that if you can find something you are good at or can do, even a little bit, your future life will become somewhat easier.
Of course, I think it's fine to consider this after taking a break and having some peace of mind.
I think there are also daily life issues, so if there are company unions, occupational doctors, or consultation windows, there might be some kind of system in place, so it might be a good idea to consult with them once.
It would be nice if we could live with a little more ease and comfort from now on, wouldn't it?

Many tornadoes occur in the United States, causing significant damage due to unseasonal warmth and strong cold influences (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of the 10th (Fri) to the 11th (Sat) local time, numerous tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern part of the United States.
Due to the strong cold air moving southward in this record-breaking warm period, the atmospheric conditions became extremely unstable, and it is believed that cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
In the southern United States, warm air flowed in from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature on the 9th (Thursday) and 10th (Friday) local time is close to 30℃.
In places where such record warmth had been occurring, strong cold air of minus 30 degrees Celsius or lower descended from the upper atmosphere at around 5,500 meters, causing an active front to form due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It is believed that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern United States is originally a region prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of significant damage during this period.
In winter, the number of tornado warnings announced in one day reached nearly 150, which was a record high.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received over 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts on the 10th (Friday) local time.
According to this, it can be seen that there are two major concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado reached EF3, the third strongest level out of six on the EF scale (Enhanced Fujita scale), and it is believed that gusts of around 70 m/s blew momentarily.
Depending on future investigations, there is a possibility that it may be determined as EF4-5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the improved Fujita scale) is used, which is based on the improved Fujita scale and adapted to the conditions of Japanese buildings and other factors.
This time, a tornado equivalent to the American EF3 has a sufficient possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses could collapse.

"Record largest" US tornado: voices seeking help from under the rubble broadcast live (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and the South of the United States, President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a solemn expression, saying it was "one of the largest tornadoes in US history."
U.S. CNN television and others reported.
Mr. Biden emphasized that "we will do everything as a federal government."
The explanation was, "We still don't know the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost."
There is a fear that the number of deaths may exceed 100.
[Photo] In Kentucky, which was hit by a tornado, residents carry household goods and other items from damaged houses. From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
As for the range of tornado damage, there is a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) of damage in Missouri and other places in 1925, but a weather expert from CNN estimated that this time it was the largest scale at about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered significant damage, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season also suffered extensive damage.
At that time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it remained.
In the darkness, a woman who was unable to move under debris about 1.5 meters thick felt the weight of rescuers searching on top of the debris and called for help through a live broadcast on Facebook from her smartphone.
In the public live broadcast, in addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, there were also screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which is believed to have been sung by another woman crying to distract from the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son due to a tornado warning and was safe.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying rumble, as if something was about to burst out," they recalled.
The Mayfield police officer said, "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary."
"I don't know whether it will be weeks, months, or years, but I continued my desperate rescue efforts."
In Illinois, a partial collapse of an Amazon warehouse has been confirmed, resulting in at least six deaths.
The impact was so strong that train cars were derailed and separated, and highways are being closed one after another due to the effects of vehicle overturning.
According to the US web media, it is said that about 400,000 households, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are experiencing power outages.

Living on welfare is tough, isn't it...
I'm praying that somehow it can be done.
If there were live-in job opportunities like inns or resort part-time jobs, it would be nice to secure both an address and a source of income, but with the current social situation due to the coronavirus, it seems like there are fewer options.
I searched briefly and it seems like there is a site like this↓,
Live-in part-time and full-time job - Live-in Job Recruitment Navi (Sumi Navi)
There is a related search for "a job with a reason to live in," so it seems like there are many people like that among my colleagues.
Bank accounts and line contracts can be managed somehow with just an address for the first time, but credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards) cannot be renewed without an address (because the new card will be sent to the registered address).
What does it mean to be a gynecologist specialist doctor?
A "specialist doctor" is a physician in their 3rd to 5th year after graduation.
It is also called "specialist doctor" and "postgraduate trainee doctor."
In other words, the so-called "resident doctor" refers to the "initial resident doctor," which refers to doctors in their first or second year after graduation.
Although it can be said that I am inexperienced, by the 4th or 5th year, I become able to perform a certain level of medical treatment, so I am entrusted with various tasks.

There has been a long-standing argument that the way of thinking about the star rating system is different.
The claim is that while other countries use a five-star standard and deduct points from there, Japan considers three stars as neutral and adds or deducts points accordingly.
At the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have completely different meanings, such as "there are demerit points" and "not a masterpiece but a good work."
If we base it on a 5-star standard, "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest level in every aspect" would be treated as equal, so if there is such a tendency, I think it would be a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars. However, since such a system is actually being used and operated in that way, the point is that they would like us not to give 3 stars (negative reviews).
That's why when trying to argue with people who advocate this kind of argument using Steam's binary evaluation, the conversation doesn't mesh well.

Is there an underwater pump that can accommodate a standard hose size and can be powered by USB?
The power capacity that can be obtained from a USB is approximately up to 2A at 5V, so it is at most 10W.
It depends on the type of submersible pump, but it consumes at least about 500W, so it's definitely impossible.

Making your own radio
I made an AM radio with my own homemade capacitors and coils, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the sound of the radio, but I heard a different radio than the frequency I had tuned to.
There is a possibility that the tuning was too weak and couldn't be heard properly, but it was different from the expected station.
The main point here is that I was supposed to have made an AM radio, but it seems like I could hear FM radio.
What do you think is the reason? I wonder if such a thing really happens?

"Saga Eating Out Column" - "Hakobune's Freshly Caught Seasonal Fish Fry and Shrimp Fry with Homemade Tartar Sauce" | Lifestyle & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box: "Seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry caught in nearby waters, with homemade tartar sauce"
A takeout specialty store "hakobune" offering colorful bento boxes and deli dishes, generously using vegetables.
"In order to let people enjoy the restaurant atmosphere at home," Mr. Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Mrs. Yumi (38) opened [the business] in August last year.
One of the popular lunch box menus is "Seasonal fish fry and shrimp fry caught in nearby waters with homemade tartar sauce" (1,000 yen).
Choose the best fish at the market depending on the time.
"By making the breadcrumbs as thin as possible, you can understand the texture of the ingredients in the fry," says Mr. Takayuki, and the shrimp fry has a plump texture that can be directly understood.
The bento box comes with about four types of side vegetables and deli items, mixed grain rice made with Saga prefecture's Hinohikari rice, and soup.
Vegetables are homemade from the nearby fields or purchased from local direct sales outlets in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Mr. Yoshiyuki has trained in French cuisine, adding color with dishes such as rapée and ratatouille.
On the other hand, they have made it a Japanese-Western fusion that a wide range of generations can enjoy, with a familiar and comforting taste like rolled omelette with dashi (according to Yumi-san).
The bento "Handmade Hamburger with Domestic Mixed Meat" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, they will also release a "charcuterie set" of processed meats that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried using it.
The ride comfort is not that bad, but it occasionally shakes (not enough to make you feel sick).
Speed is naturally slow.
I think it's relatively safe because the speed decreases when there are people around, and in some cases, it comes to a complete stop. However, I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
The surrounding gazes hurt, being seen itself is fine, but being seen with a feeling of "you're in the way" hurts my heart.
Overall, it wasn't bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if people would move to the edges and be more considerate.
I thought it would be a good idea to create a dedicated lane, for example, so as not to disturb other people walking around.
However, since it's a relaxing ride and you can enjoy the scenery at a leisurely pace, I thought it would be a great mode of transportation if there were just a few less people.
In the future, I wonder if this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream, and the excitement of the near future and the pain of the surrounding gaze make it a comfortable ride, but it's a difficult vehicle to handle unless you have a pretty strong and patient heart.
It was so embarrassing.

If you look really closely, you might be able to tell a little, but there is no eel used at all in this fake eel bowl.
The truth is, it's "!Eggplant!" (Tap to reveal the correct answer)
I like eel, but I used to think that everyone was just eating it for the sauce, and that the actual eel part didn't matter as long as it was cooked properly. But then I realized that the texture and amount of eel are actually quite important.
I don't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
Used recipe: EGGPLANT "UNAGI" - Woks of Life (I put sansho pepper instead of green onions).
It's just a dish where I steamed it and then grilled it with sauce on a frying pan, but it takes about 30 minutes to cook.

But I don't know how to live from now on.
I've worked at a supermarket part-time before, but I couldn't even do that kind of job (so I was working as a part-time engineer).
Are there any LLLers who have experienced sick leave or resignation?

One man slashed, male suspect flees on motorcycle: Attempted murder case on the 12th in Saga City, Oozai | Incidents & Accidents | Saga Newspaper News | Saga Newspaper LiVE
Around 1:25 am on the 12th, on a street in Ootakarai 1-chome, Saga City, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a bladed weapon by a man believed to be in his 30s to 40s, resulting in injuries to his face.
The man escaped on a motorcycle, and the Saga Minami Police Station is pursuing him as an attempted murder case.
According to the Minami Police Station, there was a 110 call from a passerby saying "they are fighting."
The man sustained a 10-centimeter long and 1-centimeter deep injury on his left cheek, but he is conscious.
The man who escaped is medium build with a shaved head.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
The man was reportedly drinking with several acquaintances, and authorities are investigating the possibility of some kind of traffic trouble between the male pedestrian and the man on the motorcycle.

A long journey of a family who rooted environmental protection activities in the Chinese border region (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
Kato Yuki: Hong Kong company Find Asia corporate consultant: China, with its vast territory, is also important in terms of biodiversity, having the highest number of mammal species in the world and ranking third in the number of plant species.
In some municipalities, the value of biodiversity is recognized, and not only the environmental protection carried out by the municipality, but also the activities of environmental activists are promoted in some areas.
Yunnan Province's Xishuangbanna, located in southwestern China, is also one of such regions.
My sister, Ri Wanda, is currently active as an actress. Sisapan is a region bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Dai (Thai) people, who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, are flowing.
The area of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture (Xishuangbanna Tai Ethnic Group) is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wildlife and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we met with Min-guo Li, who is conducting environmental conservation activities at Sisapan, and had the opportunity to hear about the content of their activities on site.
Started environmental protection activities with her German husband - - It has been 20 years since they started environmental protection activities.
What kind of opportunity was it?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tianzi" started in 2000.
The catalyst for that is my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Shisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest region in China, boasting a remarkable biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was also lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest was carried out in the past in order to establish industries in this region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was dispatched from Germany to here for the recovery of natural resources and research on biological resources.
And then, I met and married someone who knew me as a journalist here.
"Before that, was Mr. Lee not interested in nature conservation?"
Mr. Lee, I am from Southeast Asia, but I was not interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
As a result, I ended up promoting the project with my husband without having that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though their face is not particularly well-featured and they are not especially tall. Why do you think that is?

Aura is not something that comes out when you think it will.

That person must have a strong inner confidence, right?

It's not too detailed, is it?
I can see it, though.
I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been told "praise is in the details," so I'm not quite sure what it means.
Is it something like praising in detail?
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
"Sakura-san confessed to me, and my heart is in full bloom. I'm the one who should be asking, so let's start dating," I replied.
And to get along, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share the things we both enjoy.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open one later when I want to?
The procedure will be completed more quickly if you open them at the same time.
It will be completed in about a week now.
I recommend opening a NISA account at the same time, as there are no handling fees and you can use it immediately when you want to.

[Personal Memo / Oma Environment] The cause of the CTD in the MOD environment took about a month and a half to identify.
Until March, there was stable data, but from around Golden Week, I couldn't find much time to play, and multiple factors caused CTDs to occur. Investigating this issue little by little during holidays, it took a very long time to identify the cause.
Why didn't you analyze the log with .Net Script Framework (it would probably take only a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and meshes do not leave a crash log.
The main timing of CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth)
Leave no traces in logs of all Papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins that record logs.
When killing/attacking some NPCs: Activated by console kill command → Improvement with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE updated version) OFF. ※ Is there a possibility of false accusation regarding this?
During the camera work when activating a kill move against some NPCs → The basic improvement is to turn off the kill move setting by the PC via the .ini file: Is it a setting conflict related to DAR + Nemesis? However, the number of DAR animations is not even close to the limit, and it has not reached 10,000.
During field movement (mainly outdoors) + activating some magic (e.g., freezing rune), when hitting an NPC: Turning off all settings for applying SPID to NPCs in Dirt & Blood v 2.0 (top right of MCM) and trying 5 times in a row, everything improved.
Is it due to an additional armor and body mesh shader setting mistake for some actors/NPCs? In addition, there is a formatting error in the default .ini file for using SPID 2.0, but the intended result should still be achieved, and the prerequisite Perk should be applied to the NPCs.
At first, I focused on checking by mainly accusing the wrong parts of the attack and OnHit-related motions/combat MODs (.dll ones), but this is the result I got.
I think there were no similar bug reports at least in English, German, and French levels.
In case there is someone who is facing the same CTD issue in a Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful as a reference and a reminder, so I allowed myself to post it.
Everyone is barely managing with their mental state.
No one around me notices it, not even my colleagues or family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that it's amazing how that person can work so energetically even though they seem to be having a hard time.
But, he is probably on the edge of his mental limit as well.
I didn't resign under the pretext of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before resigning.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric home visit nursing - after today's home visit nursing is over
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time due to my bipolar disorder, and I have had a long relationship with the female nurse at the home nursing station I am currently using, and I believe we have built a very good relationship.
Every week, we talk about various topics.
Of course, they also do things necessary for medication management (such as unit-dose packaging), but above all, during today's home visit nursing, I deeply realized how important enjoyable communication is for people with mental disorders.
Today we had a casual chat, or rather a discussion, about gender differences and even touched on gender theory, lol.
We also talk about things like male and female sexual desires, why she got divorced, and whether it's okay to discuss such topics during a home nursing visit.
Sometimes, there are times when I dress up as a woman.
However, in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, I have heard from acquaintances that older nurses who can no longer work in the wards come and only provide administrative support, or even though an occupational therapist comes for home-visit nursing, they give instructions with a condescending attitude, saying things like "We are providing medical care here."
I am using a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are truly good nurses who treat me, who have a mental illness, equally and frankly.
By the way, she's beautiful, lol.
There may be some people who are receiving psychiatric home care, and there may be some who are considering receiving it.
Visiting nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illnesses.
If the doctor approves, let's definitely go for it.
And, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, there were times when I just couldn't get along with someone, so I had to terminate the contract from my side.
I apologize for the poor writing.
I know it's a false alarm, but I was scared when it came up in English.
Why does it come up in English?
There are several possible reasons, for example...
I don't know how it will be displayed in Japanese for the person who made it.
・Language detection malfunction

In the lottery 6, the ranking of the number of appearances in the number of draws is all odd numbers.
Why is it difficult for odd numbers to come up, I wonder?
It's mysterious.
There seems to be a pattern in appearance.
Repeating or continuing.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we have switched to teleworking.
But at home, I can't concentrate on my work.
I get restless and end up touching my phone immediately.

I'm just doing it half-heartedly without concentrating, lol.
It feels like I'm barely doing the things I have to do.
I also end up touching my phone all the time.
South Korea's hydrogen technology patents are one-fifth of China's... "Delay in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap" (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese Edition) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The plan was to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (cumulative) by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price is set at 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only at 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The hydrogen station infrastructure's proliferation schedule is also at 38% (about 117 locations) of the target, and the hydrogen price per kilometer is still around 8,400 won, which is not much different from the time when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap implementation status is significantly below the target value.
On the 12th, the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) announced a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem."
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan.
Carbon fibers, the core material of fuel cell vehicles, are supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane films by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA), among others.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has been increasing at an average annual rate of 14% since 2014.
In the number of patents in the hydrogen production and fuel cell sector (cumulative total from 2014 to 2020), South Korea ranks 5th in the world.
However, Keizai Doyukai (Japan Association of Corporate Executives) reported that "in fact, six countries virtually occupy the majority of the global hydrogen market, and in reality, it means that we are at the bottom among the competing countries."
The ranking of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan in that order.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States to become number one, and has been widening the gap ever since.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in South Korea was 1,033, surpassing Japan (974) to become 4th place, but it was only 22% of the level of China (4,721).
Zenkeiren proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax deduction for facility investment and research and development costs."
It has been a month and a half since I had surgery to cut the tendon in my finger.

From the Meiji to Showa period, were older sister-like wives a minority compared to now?
I think there were many older-sister-like wives.
It has become so common that the phrase "older sister wife" is being said in public.
And in the old days, it was said that one should search for a wife who is one year older, even if it means wearing golden straw sandals. Therefore, I think there were more older wives in the Meiji and Showa eras than there are now.

In a free competition, for example, the rarity value of a branded item may increase more than its list price.
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and their prices to increase.
The reason why the PS5 is being sold at a high price is due to its rarity, and its value has simply increased more than the regular price.

Parliament on Sunday?
Creating TV program-style flyers for ongoing council reform in Takasu, and "report cards" for council members: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Edition
The Takasu Town Council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as creating eye-catching flyers to guide regular meetings and introducing a "report card" for residents to evaluate council members.
The aim is to get the townspeople interested in the town council election, which has had no votes for three consecutive terms.
In order to raise awareness of the Sunday meeting held on the 12th, we distributed about 1,800 new flyers in newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Raw Giron from the morning," "Tetsuko's room," "Jin Sawaguchi Exploration Series"...
The flyer distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th features phrases reminiscent of popular TV show titles.
Kata-yama Hyoue (43), a member of the parliament who created it, says, "I want people to chuckle and come to the parliament."

US aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, engage in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) A US State Department official reported that by the 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine based on the security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid amounts to a total of 600 million dollars (about 68 billion yen), and the final equipment, including four radars to identify the launch points of mortars and other weapons, will be transported to Ukraine after the new year.
According to the US Department of Defense spokesperson Kirby, these aids included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile "Javelin."
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's troop buildup and other activities around the border with Ukraine.
The US is increasing its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, consulting with NATO member countries, and is also preparing countermeasures in case Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved military assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st this year.
Military assistance from the United States to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
The total amount of aid since Russia forcibly annexed the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine has exceeded 2.5 billion dollars.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, US National Guard troops from Florida were dispatched in accordance with a multinational joint training plan to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US special operations forces in Europe also play a significant role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed due to operational confidentiality.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were tense exchanges over the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also showing a readiness to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The future of the "review" of inheritance and gift tax that makes lifetime gifts a "forbidden move": A direct hit on Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Investigation Committee!
The first feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talk with your family during the year-end and New Year holidays!"
This is "Lifetime Gift and Last-minute Inheritance Technique."
Amid discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax, the 2022 tax reform outline, which was a concern, has been postponed. However, there is a high possibility that the pre-death gift, which is the main strategy for inheritance tax, will be "prohibited" in the near future.
How will the inheritance rules change?
Together with a direct hit on former LDP Tax Investigation Committee Chairman and House of Representatives member Akira Amari, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for making advantageous last-minute gifts in time for the end of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Hiroaki Miyahara)
"From wealthy individuals to urban office workers, prohibiting the use of lifetime gifts as a 'forbidden move,' we will proceed with a thorough examination of constructing a neutral tax system that considers inheritance tax and gift tax more holistically, focusing on the timing of asset transfers."
The sentence in English is: "A statement in the 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year caused great unrest not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class."
This is because it means to completely change the inheritance rules and make the "lifetime gift," which is the main strategy for inheritance tax, a "forbidden move" in order to increase the inheritance tax significantly.
The golden rule of tax-saving measures for high progressive inheritance tax is "to reduce the taxable property."
The strongest trump card, the lifetime gift, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of all that, a sudden debate on the "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" emerged.
Although the fastest introduction was a concern and was postponed in the outline of the tax reform for the fiscal year 22 announced on December 10th, the policy for integration was re-emphasized with more in-depth wording, such as "reviewing the current inheritance tax system and the calendar year gift system" and "the non-taxation measures for gift tax are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omission) and will continue to be reviewed without interruption."
In an interview with our editorial department, former Secretary-General Amari Akira, former Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Research Council, says.
"It is most important to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages depending on the timing of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same whenever it is done."
"Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise due to integration. If the amendment is made at the fastest pace, there will be three more chances for lifetime gifts to be made."
Even if that's not the case, it seems certain that in the near future, a major shift will be made toward invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly do the inheritance tax and gift tax rules change?

"My Righteous Older Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10, 2022. Yudai Furukawa says, "Please look forward to it!"
The FOD original drama "My Righteous Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from the late night of January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Heroine role of Yamatani Hanazumi. This work, based on the manga of the same name by Morie Satoshi, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018, is a heart-wrenching pure love story of a man and a woman burdened with their past.
Furukawa plays the protagonist Kai, and Yamaya Hanazono plays the heroine Rie.
University student Rie meets her part-time job senior, Kairi.
Haru, a mysterious young man who is troubled by insomnia every day, can somehow sleep soundly when he borrows Rie's shoulder for some reason.
Rise is attracted to Kairi, who resembles her long-lost brother due to their parents' divorce, but at some point, she wonders if Kairi might be a murderer.
Yuta Furukawa's comment: The drama "My Righteous Brother" is set to be broadcast on terrestrial channels starting January 10th!
For those who were unable to watch it on FOD, we would like you to look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, we believe that you can gain a deeper understanding of this work by watching the complex psychological portrayals of Kairi and Rie, as well as their struggles and changes in their relationship, knowing the development of the story.
I would be happy if the original fans could also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

【NFL】The team that won with 3 passes in 1 game - What did the players feel and how did they experience it? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only 3 passes for the Patriots.
In the past 50 years of the NFL, this was the fewest number of passes since the Bills recorded 2 passes in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an extraordinary genius running back named O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs by Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
This time, the main reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense was due to the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, and its latitude is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, with strong winds of 18 meters per second, and it was snowing heavily before the match.
As expected of the local Bills, they didn't change their play selection much.
There were 30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was never poorly done.
In 10 offensive series, they entered the red zone 4 times, so there were scoring opportunities.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they could only score 3 points with 1 field goal in those 3 attempts.
Defense in front of the goal in the final stage of the match.
The Bills, trailing by 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
The goal is 18 yards away.
On 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by the Patriots' defense rush and escaped the pocket, moving to the right.
And he threw a pass targeting TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but it failed.
In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the right outside, ran a shallow cross and became free in front of the end zone, but it seems that he was not in Allen's view.
On 4th and 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis, who ran in from the left outside to the end zone, but the pass was knocked down by Patriots DB Myles Bryant in front, resulting in a failed attempt.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills' WR Cole Beasley, but he let go of Beasley midway and reacted to Allen's movement towards the pass.
Allen, who missed two receivers, threw passes aimed at the end zone twice.
The 4th down pass might have been a decisive throw, but there was no need to aim for a touchdown on the 3rd down.
You just need to get a first down in two plays.
It was still 2 minutes before, so if they had made it 4th & short, Allen's ability to run himself should have come into play.

It's about time to "discard" & "replace" these 3 items that tend to stay in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, the sponge is probably not replaced as frequently as recommended.
From a 2017 study, it has been found that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, a lot of bacteria still multiply (however, it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture points out that cutting boards should be replaced when they start to wear out and develop scratches or grooves.
Once wounds or grooves progress, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, and bacteria proliferate.
If it's still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid and leave it for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, then either let it air dry or gently pat dry with a clean paper towel to remove excess water.
Chipped or cracked tableware
Throwing away your favorite mug might be heartbreaking, but the chipped surface can become a breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
Moreover, the missing parts can cause cuts on the lips and spillage of drinks.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new favorite mug!
The sentence in English is: Water drowns the righteous General Guan Yu. Posted by: Builder Yu Jin.
The drowned righteous general Guan Yu "Oi Yu Jin"
Yu Jin "Uss"
"Even if 30,000 arrows rain down on Yu Jin, he won't die."
"Yo"
"I wouldn't die even if I got run over by a Tiger tank."
"Yo"
"Even if you're swallowed by the muddy stream of the Han River, you won't die, right?"
"Yo"
"Then, can you withstand the water attack and underwater bridge for three koku?"
"Ussu ussu"
"Then practice so you can endure until the next battle of Fancheng!"
"Yo!"
"It's a promise, right?"
"Alright, I got it!"
"I don't care if you get killed by Cao Cao someday!"
Saying that, Yoshimasa went home.
Of course, there's no way I'm going to practice the underwater bridge attack for three hours! It's absolutely impossible unless I'm handcuffed, shackled, and submerged in a cage!
I quoted from the beginning part of the article, but did you actually read the linked article?
Community market and trade are different things.
In the community market, we use Steam's payment system.
This feature allows transactions with strangers in cash, so there are people who fall victim to scams where their items are taken without receiving any payment.
That means it won't happen.
Trade is a function that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, and there is no buying and selling function.
Is occupation and employment type a different topic?
Rather, I can't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases where simple labor is a full-time employee, and there are cases where intellectual labor is non-regular.
Help, FlashBIOS won't finish.
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk that I bought in September.
I once went to the BIOS settings screen, but after saving the settings and restarting, the screen turned black with a white dot that seemed like a cursor, and it remained unresponsive without blinking.
I thought the BIOS was corrupted, so I tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it never finishes at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to finish in about 5 minutes, but it doesn't finish even in an hour.
The possible cause could be that the USB memory I tried is too old, or it's due to using a converter for the SD card.
I slept too much and now my phone is messed up.
Is there any other cause that seems likely?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Ah! There was someone I know.
He always had a face like a vagabond.
I wasn't particularly disliked.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to have branded items.
I can carry inconspicuous items, but I cannot carry things like Louis Vuitton that have a bold monogram with "Lv" written on them.
Why is that?
I think it's best to have something that suits your own size.
By the way, I think it's good if it's Japan.
If it's Japan, it's [blank].
It doesn't matter if it's foreign-style or not.
You should say it sooner, "Why am I the only one being called without honorifics/informal language?"
"If it becomes like 'It doesn't matter because they're a foreigner, right?' then it's better to simply say that it's uncomfortable."
I think they probably don't even dream that there's a fair chance they feel uncomfortable.
I used to live abroad, and there were quite a few Japanese people, including myself, who went there because they didn't like the Confucian hierarchical customs. Some of them seemed to have misunderstood that they could say anything to the locals, as if they had taken off their restraints.
If they look like Westerners, I think they are doing it with no ill will, but rather out of a certain sense of indulgence or friendliness.
Even if they are my friends and from Western countries, I usually call them by their first names, but when I speak in Japanese, I sometimes hesitate which one to use.
Well, it's still fine if they're just friends.
At first, they might just be doing it normally and purely, but if we overlook it, the exceptional treatment of "because they are foreigners" might become uncontrollable, so it's better to say it now.
Can you please speak according to Japanese rules since we are in Japan? That's the kind of feeling.
Editing: Although it's unrelated, my Caucasian friend who naturalized always raises his glass higher than the others who are younger than him when making a toast at drinking parties.
There's no doubt that I'm doing it consciously, but I think it's a good habit because when I do it, I'm treated like a Japanese person, not being looked down upon by both younger and older people.
Japanese people (including myself) tend to pay attention to such small details regardless of their personality, and there are some annoying ones.

Thank you to 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, I found that this newly created subreddit had already surpassed 50 subscribers.
I'm super happy.
Thank you to everyone who has subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
I would appreciate it if those who subscribed to this subreddit today could let me know in the comments where they found out about this subreddit! (I have no idea, so I'm really curious)
Since I am the only one creating threads right now, I would appreciate it if everyone else could also create threads.
Even if you don't create a thread, your comments and such are encouraging.
Maybe there are few people who use Twitter while using Reddit.
People who use Twitter, please feel free to create threads as well!
Lastly, I would like to say thank you very much! The subreddit I created before didn't attract people as I expected, and I quickly gave up. But this time, thanks to all of you, it seems like I can continue without giving up.
We will continue to work hard to make the subreddit easy to use by properly maintaining the wiki and rules, so please continue to support us in the future!

I think if we continue with such exaggerated forecasts, viewers will stop believing them.

Well, let bygones be bygones!
I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge based on the translated text only.
I think the translated text feels a bit awkward in the sentences, but the intended message is understandable, and it's at a level where it doesn't hinder gameplay (I feel this way, but it might be better to ask other people as well).
I often see translations of this level in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel that it's well translated.
I think whether a non-native Japanese speaker can understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language depends on whether they have studied it for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel any discomfort, it might be a good idea to look for someone else.

Investigation: "Demon Slayer" training is the battle.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human anthem ＜Anime "Red Light District Arc" Commemoration＞ (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
In recent shonen manga, what makes "Demon Slayer" particularly unique is the "excessive amount of training."
It has become a common belief that training arcs, where there are generally no battles and the characters train day and night, are not popular among readers.
In the same Jump manga "One Piece," when the Straw Hat crew was separated, there was a two-year training period, but only a touch of it was depicted, and the rest was boldly skipped over, so it can be inferred from that.
Well, one of the charms of One Piece is the eccentricity of the various lands it travels through, so "staying in the same place and training" might not always be the best fit.
Well, it can be said that the protagonist of "Demon Slayer," Tanjiro's training, began when he prostrated himself before Tomioka Giyuu, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life. Giyuu told him, "Don't let others hold the power of life and death over you!!"
There are no rights or options for the weak; they can only be completely overpowered by the strong through force...
While saying that, the introduction of Sakonji Urokodaki, the "trainer" who trains the Demon Slayer Corps' applicants, was a kind act by Giyu (although he is also bad at communicating without explaining his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Rengoku was when Rengoku asked, "What would you do if your sister ate a person?" Tanjiro, who was at a loss for an answer, was met with a slap and told, "Your judgment is too slow."
It's an unreasonable exchange at first glance, which is a topic of conversation among fans.
However, walking around with a sister who has become a demon entails the possibility that a moment may come when such a decision is forced upon us.
It could be called an initiation to enter training from a mental readiness.
However, Rengoku, who hasn't trained yet, takes the amateur Tanjiro to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain has thin air, and it's full of pitfalls, stone-throwing machines, and traps, so I might die before I even start training.
Even so, with their inherent sharp sense of smell, they manage to detect the faint scent of traps set by human hands and barely avoid them, which is just barely considered as the "protagonist's correction."
"Even so, it's not like I can suddenly avoid everything and my physical abilities will increase dramatically!!" This essence of Demon Slayer, which makes Tanjiro say such things, is what makes it truly Demon Slayer.
Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any basis, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills they have honed up to that point" at their full potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who have made efforts according to the amount they have made and gives nothing to those who have not made any effort, is a humanistic praise that is different from the baseless supernatural power possessed by demons, and is a consistent and unshakable rule in this work.
Is this old?
Still not in a bed, but a way of sleeping where a mat is laid directly on the floor of the house, with a futon and a comforter.
Because my house is not an apartment.
I'm doing that too.
If you want to use the room more spaciously, it's better to lay out a futon and sleep rather than using a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Are you greedy?
Working as a part-timer and wanting to work full-time by having multiple jobs at different stores, is that greedy?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In such cases, I don't think it falls under the category of "greedy" as I see it.
I think trying to somehow obtain more profit than the effort put in with minimal effort is considered "greedy."

South Korea's Samsung Electronics has established a new "DX Division" that integrates home appliances and mobile devices, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of Samsung Electronics' CE and IM divisions into a single set division, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
The intention to enhance user experience (Experience) through a variety of services, ranging from mobile to home appliances, can be inferred.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly launched DX division, which integrates the CE and IM divisions, consists of business units such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
A Samsung Electronics official explained that "this name change reflects the medium-to-long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership."
Furthermore, they added that the intention is to emphasize not only products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, but also to enable consumers to easily enjoy optimized experiences through services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
The strategy of creating synergistic effects across the entire company by transcending organizational boundaries and building a foundation for differentiated products and services, in conjunction with the launch of the integrated leadership system, is also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to enable users to freely use content and services through the interconnection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Does 1500 BCE mean "before the common era"?
What would it be in Japanese?
It was in 1500 BC.
BC means Before Christ, but based on the idea that consideration should be given to non-Christians, the notation has increasingly been written as BCE in recent years.
BCE stands for Before Common Era (before the Gregorian calendar).

There may be a matter of personal preference, but I think the "desu/masu style" does not suit natural science documentaries narrated by men with low voices.
I'd like a more heavy and formal expression, wouldn't I?
They lie, with their jaws ready, with only their armored heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is impaled and pulled under.
The antlion larva lies in wait in the sand to catch its prey at any time, showing only its disc-shaped head above the sand.
This is a little unnatural here.
The larva of the antlion lies in wait in the sand to catch its prey at any time, exposing only its disc-shaped head from the sand.
I think it should be that way.
What I'm concerned about is
Did you refer to other documentaries?
Are you looking from an ant's perspective?
Is that so?
I think if we translate "armoured heads" as "disc-shaped heads," the part that says "it's a giant beast wearing a helmet on the scale of an ant" would be lost.
Aichi 24-vehicle collision: Trailer driver has no pre-existing illness, possibly due to carelessness (TV Asahi Network (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In an accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, where 24 cars collided, it was found that the trailer driver who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor's office had no pre-existing medical conditions, and it is believed that the accident was caused by some kind of negligence.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people sustained minor injuries.
The police arrested Katsuya Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the prosecutor's office on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura suspect's trailer continued to move forward without braking even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura suspect has no pre-existing medical conditions, and it was found that some kind of negligence is believed to be the cause.
The police are conducting a search of related premises and investigating the situation at the time in detail.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4 Edition] (Weekly Pre NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started from Volume 3, concludes in this Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which covered everything from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume is packed with new tricks due to focusing on just one battle!
● "Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name: Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● The superhero wrestling match has already begun even before the actual match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes depict the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask in a detailed and careful manner. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that the volumes only depict the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, there are mutual restraint battles and special training scenes, which are quite different from before and don't easily lead to a match, but it's never boring.
The growing tension in the story as the battle of the century is about to begin is directly linked to the increasing tension of the readers, making me admire how even this period is truly a calculated and well-executed production.
And before the important finals, there is another must-see match: the third-place playoff between Terryman and Ramenman.
Not only is it a luxurious match card, but what I like is when Ramenman says to Kinnikuman's poster behind the scenes before the match, "It's my turn to aim now!"
And try to slam down the chop.
However, Terryman, who happened to pass by, stopped the hand chop, stared at each other in silence, and the scene ended with them just parting ways.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been defeated, and there is no longer a chance for them to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a fuss and struggle surrounding that Kinnikuman.
If shown something like this, I can't help but think about the distant future's success!
This is a scene that still makes me acutely aware of what it means for a character to stand out, even now as a manga artist!
The battle between the two doesn't last very long, but the memorable scene is Ramenman's tearful plea after the match.
Please don't rely solely on the divine strength of luck for Kinnikuman!
That is the line.
This is like a grand meta-commentary on the work itself, and I think the readers have always had a feeling that Kinnikuman, being the protagonist, won't lose and has somehow been winning not because of his abilities.
However, by having Ramenman make this statement, Teacher Yudetamago has taken the initiative to drive a nail in, saying that this method can no longer be used.
With this single phrase, the reader wonders, "Wait, could it be that Kinnikuman will actually defeat Robin with his true strength?"
How do you do it?
This sentence can be translated into English as: "This unseen development will surely stir up your imagination again, and from another writer's perspective, this line is like the boiled egg teacher who creates the work imposing restrictions on himself."
I think something amazing was done here.
I definitely think it's one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend held at Takahama Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Takahama Town Nakayama, the first winter illumination has begun, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illumination, which began on November 26, features 50,000 LED bulbs scattered throughout the area, including a 20-meter-tall camphor tree, walking paths, and lawns.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "I was surprised to find such a place when I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time."
They were saying, "It's incredibly beautiful and relaxing."
The illumination event, which was planned for the first time to provide a healing experience while avoiding crowds, is lit up from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
On the last day, the 25th, a Christmas event is planned, including serving hot pot and screening movies.
I think only a limited number of people can read through the documents in order.
I have a friend who can read a lot and when I asked him, well, he was able to do it, but he had been steadily building up his knowledge from the basics of Linux and reading reference books rather than documents, starting with the table of contents and reading from the parts he was interested in.
In fact, it's more practical and easier to understand to start learning from something like Linux rather than starting with something highly abstract like Docker, as it can be applied more broadly.
It's quite difficult to suddenly understand everything without going through that process.
I wish I could understand...
They said it's okay not to do it in order.
As for the contents, it seems that you don't have to memorize them, but just vaguely remember the parts you skipped before and read them when necessary.
I gradually started reading because I used to repeatedly break things in practice without reading anything first.

For the first time, the Minato Ward in Tokyo organized the "National Cooperation MINATO (Minato) Market TV," where Yamagata's Love Warriors and others made remote appearances, delivering the charm of the region along with its specialty products.
The initiative "Okitama × Minato Port Opening Project," a collaboration between the Okitama region and Minato Ward, has decided to open a store, and it was relayed from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mikasa Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier," wears a stole from the Yonezawa weave brand "nitorito (にとりと)" and introduces the charm of the region surrounded by nature.
I also delivered the state of the potato stew party with the Love Warriors.
In a Tokyo studio, comedian duo "Tampopo"'s Emiko Kawamura and YouTubers with over 300,000 subscribers tasted local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, and Tuyahime from the Oitama region.
When the deliciousness was conveyed to the viewers, comments such as "I can smell it even though it's a live stream" and "It's the best with lots of delicious things to go with alcohol" were exchanged in high praise.
Is there a way to POST what was obtained from a form on the same PHP page?
If there are values in the <input> elements within the form, it will POST them.
Isn't it something like that?
I am thinking of planting balloon flowers in the garden.
Is the bellflower resistant to the summer heat?
In that case, when the flowers finish in spring, let's cut the stem leaving about 10-15 cm.
Branches will come out from the base of the leaves, so please look forward to it.
Happy New Year.
I just returned from the first shrine visit of the year with her.
Her smile is also wonderful in the new year, isn't it?
It's a question.
How do you spend New Year's?
Please let me hear it.
Happy New Year!
It's nice to be lovey-dovey, isn't it? ＼(^o^)／
Unfortunately, this morning...
The power for the NAS PC no longer turns on🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
In the morning, I open the window for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor coming from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought that the fan's performance was only getting worse due to the room temperature drop (6℃).
So I decided to try again after warming up the room.
3.) Does not start up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp turns on for a moment and the fan starts to move, but it stops immediately.
After that, they didn't say a word.
Even if I unplug the power plug and try again, it still only turns on for a moment.
4.) Even after connecting only the motherboard with ATX 20-pin and 4-pin and removing all other parts, it still does not start.
I have been suspecting that the PSU might be the cause, as there has been a buzzing sound like the PSU fan hitting something since before.
I will try to find a spare ATX power supply later and test it.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work out... what should I do?
Should I change the case and motherboard together...
Have you seen a wild rabbit recently (within the last 4-5 years)?
Where did you see it?
Is it a place surrounded by nature?
I live in the northeast.
There's one near my house too.
They are also in places like gardens and company parking lots.
2021 Most Used Emoji Ranking (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News
My most frequently used emoji is the crying face.
I think emojis are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, many messaging apps and chat tools have made it possible to use emoji reactions instead of stamps.
Speedy, simple, no reply needed, soothing element.
In modern communication, emojis are essential for creating a soft and friendly atmosphere!
So, what kind of emojis is everyone using?
[View all images] 2021 Most Used Emoji Ranking: Top 10 most used emojis worldwide in 2021!
Overall, positive and bright emojis are ranking in.
According to the original source Unicode, 92% of the world's internet population uses emojis.
1st place occupies 5% of the total emoji usage rate!
The crying-laughing emojis in 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are really easy to use, aren't they?
During fun times and happy times, of course, I did it!
There may not be a few people who use self-deprecatingly when they feel like "at that time" or when they feel like "there's nothing they can do."
On the contrary, a person who has never used any of the top 10 emojis is extremely rare.
I hope they stick to that style.

How do you dispose of computers and peripheral devices?
Computer farm
I've brought it in once before, but even though it's located in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, they won't collect it for free from Saitama Prefecture.
(If relatively new, there are free options available)
Inverse net
I've never used it, but it seems that if you use Sagawa, cash on delivery shipping is completely free.
I'm thinking of trying it out, so if anyone knows about it, I'd like to hear the reputation.
Bulky waste, etc. (charged), additional note: collection box for small household appliances provided by the local government (free of charge)
Sell it as second-hand.
Addendum: Mercari, Hard Off
I wonder if there are people who sell at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC before.
Selling it while it can still make money might also be a wise choice.
Addendum: Lynette Japan Information provided by: /u/CheetahPresent8059
The broken printer that no one will take, and old UPS, etc., have become a nuisance.
It's not oversized garbage, so it probably won't cost any money, but somehow it's being postponed.
I collect coins as a hobby.
Could someone please tell me how much this coin is worth?
Coins in circulation in foreign countries have no value...
In Japan, banknotes are exchanged, but coins are not.
If it's a commemorative gold coin, it has value because it contains gold.
It's possible to dislike someone even if they haven't done anything wrong, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes because we are human.
"(There's no reason, but) I just don't like it." That's how it is with people you dislike.

Trial campaign in progress
I can't get a girlfriend, is it because I'm being discriminated against based on my looks?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But, it's sad that things can be decided by appearances, isn't it?
Because the inside cannot be shown.
What did you do with your school gym clothes after graduation?
I usually wear it as casual clothes ^_^
I threw it away immediately after graduation.
My wife used to wear roomwear until we started living together, lol.
Is it possible for a person to become fulfilled even after the age of 90 or 100?
Sexual desire and youth will be lost, though.
If you are healthy.
Men's volleyball advances to the finals tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's fencing: Foil finishes in 4th place, no medal won.
Ryujin Nippon, first quarterfinals in 29 years! Japan's men's volleyball team advances to the final tournament, Coach Nakagauchi says "It was a big goal."
I thought it was over when we lost the third set due to 2 referee challenges, but we managed to win in the full set.
Men's Fencing Foil Team: Japan fails to win a medal, loses to the United States
I think they were in a different class compared to the opponents up to the semi-finals, but why is such an opponent in the third place play-off?
I would like to plant trees in my garden that can serve as a screen, could you please recommend some suitable trees?
As for my preference, I would like an evergreen tree that is easy to maintain and, if possible, bears fruit.
Nice to meet you, or literally, "Please treat me well."
To bear fruit on a feijoa tree, it is better to plant other fruit-bearing trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby.
How much savings do we each need to have in order to live together comfortably without any difficulties?
It varies from person to person.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It's better to stop living together.
There is a high possibility of breaking up.
It is better to properly arrange a matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, attend various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
There are no benefits to cohabitation.
I think it's better to quit, but...
Today, I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! I thought it was a Legend Rare, but it turned out to be a re-recorded Legend Rare (^_^;)
Is it acceptable to play card games like Ganbarizing as a hobby?
I think it's an ant.
