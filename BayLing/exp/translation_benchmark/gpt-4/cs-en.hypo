The big return of the Czech unlucky man is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning back to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon make it to the goal as well.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen, or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he was substituted and since then he has not yet appeared on the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower body injury," announced the Denver team at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time, he was called up from the farm where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded a 94.5% save percentage.
A product of Pilsen hockey wants to finally make a breakthrough and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had problems with his hips and did not play a single match in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" played in 36 games, with a save percentage of 92.3%.
Charles puts a face mask on Camille in a Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo in which he helps his wife Camilla put on a mask at the races.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported on this.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and foundations with whom they collaborate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared t-shirt, just like princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not specify who took the photo, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
The royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting.
The photo, which will serve as a Christmas greeting, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured it in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who has a top hat on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask color-coordinated with her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbrov a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - In the current corruption case, criminal investigators reportedly worked with the information that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was allegedly promised a million crowns from Prague's Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz reported on this, stating that it had gained access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the Vrsovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdik, stated that the red and whites did not commit any corrupt behavior.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which the main figure from Slavia is its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer.
A former influential official of the red and whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Detectives allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had information that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the website quoted from the file.
According to the detectives, a day later, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the chairman of the Slavia board, Tvrdik.
From the file, it is not clear whether the police are still dealing with this information, according to the server.
Tvrdík rejected any corrupt behavior.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
"We have never committed any illegal actions, never sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and have never provided any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdik.
The cause of the alleged match-fixing through referees sparked a police raid in several locations, including the Prague headquarters of FAČR, in mid-October last year.
The highest-ranking person in the scandal is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid-January, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and armored personnel carriers are Cold War larping.
The guns will be new, but essentially of a worse type (gunners must leave the armored cabin and carry the rounds manually without cover).
These cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential.
Rockets - we don't have any at all (but we produce and export them abroad).
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
The pond is right next to the city.
From the river, coypus were coming out and causing damage to the crops, so I went there to sit down.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped that he would leave before something came out, but of course, the fox left in a moment.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was just a fox.
Before I got off the stand, it was gone.
It means the meadow can be a mess.
On the other hand, it's not a war, there would have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So put it in a visible place, put expensive things at your feet in a sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior signaled that respirators are significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns in just one day.
Why did the prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which offices behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with Dominika Kubištová, an editor at the iRozhlas website.
I respect soldiers and the army (probably not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology that the trained could take advantage of, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly diminish over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, and there will be no time to retrain someone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense forces are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where massive guerrilla warfare can be conducted, and it is also an explicit necessity for deterring the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, a battle can only be fought in a conflict of such scope and intensity where the guerrilla will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have suitable geography for it.
Mainly, we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
So then you get into a situation where you're watching a guy who, 2 minutes ago, couldn't hit an empty goal, now attacking alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players, and you're thinking, "damn, what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they will treat him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "dribbling past a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I see that our forward managed to get past one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however, experts do not expect any significant turnaround in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will last for some time, and as is well known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely spreading faster than the currently predominant Delta variant.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination helps against it, or post-infection immunity acquired from previous illness.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon has also entered the COVID equation on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease progression and associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat with it at home.
And soon, the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer should also supplement it, which, according to the current results, reports an effectiveness of even 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of useful tools in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic but also the question of how well the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company finished first on the tape also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral horse diseases on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
That's why Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as our beak has grown."
You will conduct a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you outright that no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture; saying this in public means losing their job and facing media lynching.
In the surveys, it looks nice, the west is good, the east is bad.
But they will really find out what people think.
There are Le Pen and Zemmour in France, both of them have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to relearn where everything is, all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the remaining two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, whether for security reasons or for the speed of deploying warheads due to a more western position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads were stored, not the entire rockets as it is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would arrive, which would pick up this warhead and mount it on some carrying device.
Besides that museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Roma classmate, and we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty chill, made good jokes, often expressed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone enjoyed being with him, he often came and wanted to clarify something, he was rarely absent, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, and he wore clean clothes.
He also went to outdoor schools, did various monkey business, but he was fine, maybe never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, gypsies, joined the same year, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and endangered other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something in an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Roma people, they always had money, they didn't try any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called after a month saying he had already transferred it to his name.
I say about myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other color, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, function, don't beat women, simply normal behavior).
But if someone comes, reaches out, empties apartments and houses, has only mess around them, causes problems... then it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants if they get involved here, start doing business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't mind, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs too.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian emergency medical services, told Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was carrying the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unknown reasons, went into the opposite lane in a curve.
After a collision with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident spokesperson of the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It involved multiple injuries and he remained trapped in the vehicle.
After being rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted in a stable condition to the České Budějovice hospital, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply for packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
They mainly collect trading cards.
"Usually, it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars up, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the postage is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, as he now has to add VAT and provide customs information to the post office.
He will receive an email with the message that customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then you just need to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant during the sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and for transportation.
In case the recipient does not arrange the customs clearance themselves, the total amount must also include a fee for the carrier.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it usually takes about five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international parcels received at the Prague post office has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to requests for information needed to complete the customs process.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
"If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be about halfway through," says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to inflation
Regarding the title, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and further growth is expected.
According to you, what should the state do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, do you think this is the way to go?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, in my opinion, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year they added 2% to my gross salary, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while being employed.
Would someone be able to explain to me why proven convicted violent offenders are sent to prison for only 6 months, for example?
I just can't wrap my head around how a court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months, just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Doesn't this also discourage potential future rape reports by victims?
The man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty.
The man from Hrob inadvertently helped the guards to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He actually called her himself.
He took a detour to get there, though.
First, he approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After being called to the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and were astonished when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made everything up just to get the guards to come to the location.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the guards for advice on how to report to the Czech Republic Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found out that the woman is on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and there is an arrest warrant issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Police.
A sincere question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally believe that we Slavs have not been ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can truly believe in something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are, if I am not mistaken, an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions, there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it states that there is no other god than Yahweh.
In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risking that I choose the wrong one out of thousands of gods, and the one true god, whom I happened to miss, sends me to hell or some similar place for it?
Other: Voluntary training followed by placement in reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for each one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person performs well, they can get a professional offer.
All components of the Czech Armed Forces could use something like that.
It could be done in collaboration with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is some kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar integration should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I perceive it also as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, German, or even Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will therefore defend us if something goes wrong.
There is no pleasure for the master.
Just one election in the USA that cuts their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to show their backs and take whatever they want.
The only thing that works long-term as a guarantee of independence is an army armed to the teeth and a population that can master the military technology of its time.
And nowadays, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled devices, so why wouldn't it be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, that's useless today, but a cheeky teenager with a remote control device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find yourself at home buried in boxes and fillings?
These "waste" materials are reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply in the market, as well as the money saved, as the packaging cardboard has increased in price by 50% recently.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly household products and eco-friendly cosmetics.
Individuals who accumulate boxes and filling material at home bring them to us in Popůvky near Brno, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only collection points for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs, and other places are being added, which help to find a use for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean Up Czech Republic.
It seems rather unfortunate to me that in today's age, technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone to play games on it do not learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, a problem has emerged (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of computer folders.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying file system with folders and throw everything onto one screen in the app.
They can use technology from childhood, but the main thing is that they learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend - starting in January - and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be accomplished in half a year.
French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, straddling between the right and the left, agree on very little, but they do agree on Europe.
In April, there will be new presidential elections in France.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
Many commentators immediately rushed to criticize that Macron is pursuing pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying more to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is quite successful with the French people.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not focus on what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, and the Czechs are finding out who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened teacher, they will not find out what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won awards for direction and for the best actress, Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the top spots on the audience ladder.
In Berlin, Anthony Hopkins became the best actor for the film The Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy/fit, and I am not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu/being congested. I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea from the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not claiming that everyone has it like this.)
Christmas book tips

Trains will start running according to the new timetable, and some carriers will change in some places.
Starting from Sunday, trains on the railway will run according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts operating instead of České dráhy.
For most routes, only the departure time will be adjusted, and possibly their route slightly as well.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Transport operators began selling tickets already during the fall.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections daily in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In the new timetable, routes will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland, in addition to domestic connections.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will dispatch more new trains in Northern Moravia or Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the entry to the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the route daily, eight in each direction.
The next changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou, and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to the spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar travel times for its long-distance trains, even despite the planned track closures.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes are expected for passengers, for example in the Českolipsko region, where on the route from Mladá Boleslav through Česká Lípa to Rumburk, instead of Czech Railways, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will operate.
Passengers will also be able to use a unified fare on the railway for the second year.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn to see the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, they were dying.
In my life, I have never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave-owning side or from that time; nobody defends this, only condemns it.
Nobody will even tell you in schools that black people often sold themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
Nobody will teach you in school that colonizers often bought land from the Indians; everywhere they just tell you how brutally we, Europeans, exterminated them, while they had been killing each other long before.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately concealing facts, but I have heard before that it happens and in my opinion it is a problem, I do not deny that (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it simply is what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from the perspective of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they also had some good achievements, and it seemed absurd to me to condemn them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And many people also forget that not everyone in the South were slaveholders and they were also opposed to many things.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and moreover, for example, our perspective doesn't exist for them (there was even a video on YT from a TV where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was appalling, those students were quite radicalized, and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it makes me a little sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it was supposed to, and it's no longer about the same thing; it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing in common with it and ignore basic biological facts are calling themselves feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, often leading to resistance even in quite reasonable matters.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they can be heard.
In any case, in conclusion, I have also never encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I rather encountered bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because, in my opinion, it is completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't achieve myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality overall to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If there is something that connects me with people, it is interests, views of the world, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a terribly cool guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always messes up with some bullshit about coronavirus, making everyone embarrassed.
Of course, there is also the Czechoslovak Hussite Church here.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born from Catholic modernity and are essentially Catholics without a pope.
I know many people who are Catholics, but attend services with the Hussites because it is very similar theologically, but the members are generally more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they even hold a mass in Latin every Sunday at 15:00, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it over from Austria.
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him this time either; they picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it over at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the group every year, I am really looking forward to it.
"It is an honor for me to have been chosen," said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, this time it happened at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Scouts usually travel by train to Vienna for him, though.
Nothing is changing in the distribution of the flame throughout the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, traveling on selected express and local trains.
From them, the light will be taken over at the stations by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where the tracks do not lead.
This year, scouts must also comply with the valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It is going on similarly to last year.
We give recommendations to both courier teams and local event organizers to, of course, wear masks, try to maintain distances, have as few people as possible, not sing to colleagues, and simply behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope and light that overcomes darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and girl scouts have been taking care of its distribution for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the latest information, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare, and education will make proper use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry, and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is being produced, and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of a company."
I work in a factory where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is hindering development when this company is barely holding on and taking orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolute agreement, it's terrible.
Even a person who was born in the internet age can sometimes fall for a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think to myself that internet ads don't affect me, but then I still catch myself being influenced by them - it's just so sophisticated that a person can't always resist it.
For that reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose an absolute ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all filth, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling that this faith has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe in something that the majority believes in and makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but rather I will believe in something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I will have my own original opinion which I will claim is critical thinking."
I won't believe everything the media says, after all.
I don't trust politicians.
Televisions have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred of them premiering this year.
Los Angeles - In the United States and other English-speaking countries, Chinese television stations and streaming platforms have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present a record-breaking more than two hundred premieres to their viewers.
The operator of the IMDb film database calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, meanwhile, included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, while globally popular films include Home Alone, Love Actually, or the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas movies, however, started in 2009 when the American cable television channel Hallmark came up with a special film series, the BBC website recalled.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Counting down to Christmas) at that time included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms like Netflix also contribute to the total sum.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter that much, what's important is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray described this genre with exaggeration, author of the book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the viewers, it is a form of escape and a way to feel at least a little peace for two hours amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark television uses the same formula for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end, some misunderstanding arises, which, however, is successfully resolved and the two of them kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch them one after another, adds Gray.
Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will start in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
Haas stable will thus send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack for a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in the qualification.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team, however, will ultimately not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
On the starting grid, there will be only nineteen cars, with Mick Schumacher, Mazepin's teammate, starting from the last position, and Max Verstappen starting from the first position, who will compete directly for the title with Lewis Hamilton.
According to Haas team statements, Mazepin is relatively fine and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
"Now she is in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a reserve driver to the race, nor can they.
A potential substitute would have to complete the qualification or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not struggling with Covid-19.
At the start of the just-ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
For this, they can also lock you up.

From the perspective of the law, covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, hepatitis, or typhoid.
§ 152 Spreading of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of introducing or spreading an infectious disease among people will be punished with imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activities, or forfeiture of property.
The perpetrator will be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years.
c) if by such an act he/she violates an important obligation arising from his/her employment, profession, position, or function, or imposed on him/her by law, or
d) If such an act causes serious harm to health.
The perpetrator will be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious harm to the health of at least two persons or death.
The perpetrator will be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, as we never really wore sweaters at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work within half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by the Swarovski company.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator of his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I am completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater so far, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

But what would increase that funding?
The EU is stuffing us with money in subsidies.
If it stops doing that, we will stop having that money.
I really don't see how the union stopping giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Grooms, scouts, and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with the ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the European Union border for several months.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"Currently, we have another reported suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class."
"Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has not been proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that it involves two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, and four have an asymptomatic course.
No one suspected of having Omicron traveled abroad.
None of the mentioned individuals traveled abroad, nor did anyone from their families, and there was no contact with anyone who stayed abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the mentioned individuals, Ciupek stated.
Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament, which took place in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
On it, there were also players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
I want to proceed like Texas in banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous American state, using a legal mechanism that Texas employed in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's position of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in effect, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion across the entire USA up to approximately the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, thereby preventing Texas Republicans from challenging it through the usual legal process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would authorize public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
These are homemade weapons without serial numbers that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, components for "ghost guns," or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," said the California governor.
The AP agency points out that California had banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the local ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict warned against the expansion of the legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, during which the vaccination schedule is gradually determined and improvements are made to the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
Perhaps from Israel, there are already many studies rolling out about the effects of the 4th dose.
According to these studies, in most patients there is up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Simply like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for that now.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should soon enter the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.
Feel free to leave the amount of material.
But reconsider WHAT is being learned.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a bit, and learning phone directories and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
In these matters, it would be really brutally possible to cut back.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things that will be necessary for life?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
At home, we have Netbox and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change my TV and internet provider.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used its new powers to stop the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the disbursement of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism allowing the withdrawal of EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU by vetoing all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, sets "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels, which would result in limiting the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
But figuring it out... At our Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I came across one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow section there were all the selected, less common, and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If possible, I won't even set foot in any supermarket anymore, sale or no sale, the golden shop on the square is the best. They might not have such a wide selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's well-organized, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I would take a vacation to Lidl.
And I don't care at all anymore.
For two years, I have been watching how data is treated here like manure; the majority of vaccination opponents are only slightly more off the mark than the majority of vaccination supporters.
A rational discussion is indeed taking place at the expert level, but only extreme opinions are reaching the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Prohibit everything, allow everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But nobody addresses the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states.
Phew, I feel relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
In my childhood, I was punished with a cooking spoon.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning; mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after catching me again, she would just bring the spatula and place it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few spanks on the butt (over the clothes).
I personally believe that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the important part is the warning because it gives the child a choice in a way, whether to disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid punishment.
In the end, a warning was usually enough for me to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document that one swears by and learns about from an early age in school, or on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be cautious with changes.
And imagine this: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at that time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has been increasingly appearing among lawyers.
The law is being tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have predicted, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing the majority of crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, in Brno University Hospital they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby.
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with, especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, with figures ranging from 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, easier, and often occurs without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic for children's infectious diseases.
Recently, really seriously ill children with coronavirus have been in the intensive care unit.
Children with post-covid syndromes were continuously in the department throughout the entire year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, which means inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and even infants of several months old.
In hospitals, there are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"At present, we have a child of several months old and an adolescent in our care," said the head physician.
However, they are pleased that so far, no child deaths due to coronavirus have been recorded at the children's hospital of FN Brno.
According to available data, as of December 6, there have been six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 years in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department - the collaboration of a psychologist is an integral part.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children alleviates the course of the disease and simultaneously reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend administering the vaccine dose even in children," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But those quiet zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/cycling in the forest off marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course, it is not monitored that much outside of national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
Music is playing in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He was weaned on the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can perform virtually the entire repertoire, and as a conductor, he works not only at the F. Šaldy Theater in Liberec but also, for example, in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theater.
He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was deflecting criticism for failing to stop the infection that turned into a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting zero increase in infections.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in many places in the fight against coronavirus, for example in the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's awesome.
The wife is happy because he mows the lawn, washes the car with a hose, and the kids play with him.
Well, just great.
If you want, I'll sell you the elephant for 5000.
Friend: Alright, let's high five, it's going to be awesome...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what kind of elephant did you sell me????
The lawn is trampled, giant poop everywhere, the car is broken down, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you speak badly about the elephant, you won't sell the elephant like this...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
It currently operates at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
But maybe in half a century the mood will be different and it will work out.
I also thought of that and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I might be nitpicking words.
I am just assuming that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines", it is no longer clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept and there is no need to further specify it for the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just nitpicking :D
Whether it is this way or that way, it is a nonsensical requirement.
An earthquake with a magnitude of five degrees was recorded in Tokyo.
On Sunday, a 5.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Japanese metropolis of Tokyo and its surrounding areas.

Vicki Holland from the UK tortured the woolly monkey Milly.
The horrifying footage shows the moment when a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Hollandová also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate's Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, according to The Sun newspaper.
Experts in monkey rehabilitation, who have been taking care of Milly after her abuse, stated that they have never seen such a frightened monkey before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff of Monkey World in Dorset, and now she is happily playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the magistrates' court in Gwent, she was given a twelve-week suspended sentence with a one-year probation period.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay approximately 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Team leader of Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyerová, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She shrank and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The little monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is content with her mate, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
Psychological scars from the abuse will haunt her forever, adds Sawyerová.
Milly's abuse came to light after the Gwent police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her apartment due to drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers for me.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possessing cocaine with the intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (approximately 50 thousand crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric era three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
So in the first grade, you get the same things as in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of cramming when nobody, with honorable exceptions, is interested in whether you know it or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and the vast majority don't even flinch and will tell you that they absolutely don't give a damn.
So what the fuck are they learning?
I am a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that moment it is pointless, and you will never get it into them anyway.
It is partly learned for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But seriously, I meant that note about not needing all this stuff for standing by the machine... ...because you simply don't need it.
Moreover, we are slowly getting to the point where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably also influenced by our communist past and the incitement against intellectuals and elites) However, the price of having barbarians standing by those machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, then covid probably would never have reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
"Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans, asking what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
There was friction between Kadir and Andrea from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move there with him, at least until they returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she was resolutely refusing that.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was an attack planned by you! Kadri retorted angrily in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts.
Kadri's alleged sincerity of his now ex-wife did not even please his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I normally don't comment on such things at all, and we never really talked about these things much in the family either.
I definitely don't want to provoke any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly harm and tarnish the name of someone I care about so much, I just can't help it!
I am sorry that I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a strong character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though he was so young at the time.
All the more it upsets me when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would terribly wish for everyone to know Kadri as well as I do, our close ones and family, she says in a statement in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added uncertainly.
A drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's because of.
Cchao began his robbery spree in a residential area parking lot, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole the equivalent of just under 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas.
The footage from one security camera then captures him walking down the street away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cchaa.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on the incriminated day.
And considering that he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
The whole matter is currently under investigation.
The drunkard climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic preparedness.
When that is canceled, the law will not be effective.
The law indeed limits the scope of business activities.
So that reason is not enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections for the representative councils of four municipalities.
On Saturday, people elected new municipal councils in the villages of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovné in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the legally established number, or the elected councils have disintegrated.
On Saturday, 99 candidates competed for a total of 28 mandates.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a fairly demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place, and most importantly, the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
She reminded that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komna in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, gaining 27.76 percent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for Komňa, who received 18.52 percent of the voters' support.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníků, was also re-elected to the council.
For one mandate in the assembly, the Komňané – independent candidates – have achieved.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the municipality of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
In the repeated elections in Lužice in the Most region, the Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won again.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, just like in 2018, it has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place was taken by the candidate of the Obec pro lid party, which received 43.27 percent of the votes, thus having three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
In the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region, independent candidates from the Hope for Nová Ves party won against the ANO Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted and thus gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and now has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all these things that people are writing to you here.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, then it's sad.
I am not claiming that Christians are degenerates, nor anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal for them to look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it amassed, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
Tl;dr: Believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster if you want, but the state and the church should not be involved together.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall, with the regional Emergency Medical Services rescuers intervening.
Workers of the regional operational center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height an hour after midnight on Saturday.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedical - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that a twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and landed headfirst on concrete!
In Vítkovice, the coal caught fire.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to his life.
The attending physician intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, he was transported by ambulance to the care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesman of the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns about the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities than about the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but primarily doctors and medical staff are on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt.
MMA experienced a spectacular gala evening full of interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunesová, who had not found a conqueror for seven whole years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, demonstrated a great choke against Dustin Poirier, and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also achieved victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody expected.
That brought the women's bantamweight fight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as a proverbial "dwarf," as Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, sending her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack using an arm lever.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated each other to a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová took Nunesová to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and shake off the attack.
The American woman thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but gradually the tide began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to defeat his opponent with an armlock.
He didn't do too well at first, but then he put a lot of pressure on, got his opponent on his back, and buried him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out from the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley secured a dominant victory, as he landed a hard right rear on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he finished him off with a series of accurately aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to handle Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, but now after seven years, she lost.
Is it this hip or that hip?
At first glance, it's not anything complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem in determining whether they belong to the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender.
However, there is also a relatively large group of nouns here, for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
During declension, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an indeclinable form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender; in the first case, they are declined according to the pattern of "stroj", and in the second case, according to the pattern of "píseň".
In another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first case of singular, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly other Czech-Moravian word pairs are also like this: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally indeclinable, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is of both masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which remains in the neuter gender without inflection, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like directly at the Greek borders?
Tension prevails at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began heading to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like directly on site?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes a journalist from Sydney.
Destructive fires, which Australia has been grappling with for the fourth month, have killed nearly thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
And what will the countries have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with a journalist from Sydney, Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everything is always written about everyone everywhere.
For people, it is unpleasant to address how sexual violence looks in our society and how terribly widespread it is, so they try to downplay it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have experienced how they are often treated by those around them or even the police.
Victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still, too many people keep it to themselves.
There are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and a spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are made up" and that it is a "trend," you are only helping sexual abusers.
Unfinished houses are flooding the Czech Republic, families do not have money for completion.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have gotten into a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the means to complete the unfinished family houses and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already started family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move into unfinished and unapproved houses.
"In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
In a year, we will build two to three family houses, and we have already achieved this for fifty percent.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some contractual things, even though the material has become more expensive.
"So we are working without profit," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
Many people will only have financial problems later.
If they estimated that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost them seven.
"I think some people will wait," added Slivoň.
From the materials, the most expensive were copper, iron, and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in construction fields, and the influx of foreign workers is being slowed down by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
"In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will be doing even better.
However, a real vision is missing, says the commentator of ČRO - mujRozhlas.
Entering the new year, in addition to the classic celebrations, was traditionally accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the speakers to the nation also included the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What crucial information have we learned?
I find the thesis great in that regard, I have my own topic that I chose, I build on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then write the written part in a week or two.
The state exams are completely relaxed here, as long as a person is not a total idiot and has something left in their head, the committee will not unnecessarily choke them on theory.
I, for example, studied for the state exams for a week, and when I was at my wit's end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which immediately clicked for me and I got it right.
Otherwise, regarding those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we've done it many times, really beneficial, you learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're all set.
In my opinion, it's great when there is an exam at the end of the subject that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
Everything is ok, but don't overload emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You will be the same jerk as them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe give it to him in such a way that it reaches Xi Jinping's butt or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing obstacles in the way of artists.
As soon as you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
Moreover, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
Lately, it's been pissing me off a lot, so I might have to stoop to TikTok, where many artists in my field are successful and can't get enough of it.
In the end, I might even be glad if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Working Party in Donbas
Union - yes, breakup - no, the opponents of the USSR's breakup express their opinion in the photo.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open indulgent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
And regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed in one sitting in the Bialowieza Forest what had been built in the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and detached fourteen republics from the largest world power, which had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we can see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the rise of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum."
Everything that was hastily betrayed and abandoned was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events from the late eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket may not directly correspond to its quality and value.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making dinner from it on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or should I wait until Thursday when the meat will be 1 day before its expiration date and discounted to 69 CZK/kg - how would this meat be different from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - with nothing.
These talks about how if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled, or low-quality are incredibly stupid, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I was walking in Brno at Hlavas and in the underpass, some girls were handing out some brochures. I always take similar things to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God. I was confused, but I had a feeling it was some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who published it and eventually it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, it was a good sailor, full of completely useless lessons, like I should wash myself and not be a wimp.
A waste of paper, forests didn't have to be cut down for this.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you like them, without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
For about a year, it was a great relationship, but then another half a year passed and she started to go crazy.
After that, I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her and lied to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from going into a frenzy again.
Such a person will drain you of feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
Better keep your distance.
When insurance companies are furiously looting here by purchasing a bunch of tests and quickly focusing on the positives, who wouldn't even know about that terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
The only thing we achieve is causing complications for companies, carriers, and others, due to their employees receiving five days of house arrest in the random number generator.
In the West, they have already stopped with that nonsense and realized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing some nonsense.
I see that the good old junk is coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is once again returning to the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), initial promises about product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to worry about that, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and persuade someone.
When the first earned money came, one quickly realized that if they want to earn, they have to produce several certain products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable things, so then a person felt like a door-to-door pots salesman.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump on every bait and to thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to others, but they certainly won't be boasting about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many such things.
HR is calm, managers mind their own management, and they don't stick their noses into our business too much.
So regular evaluations do happen somehow, and in the form that it takes place here, it works quite well (set some goals for the next year, and in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-assessment rather than someone evaluating you based on some numbers, and so on.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes one feels like we are almost a startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But it works like this, they don't bother us too much as long as there are results.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police fruitlessly searched for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the resigning Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště was found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In consideration of the family, we will not be providing more information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek stated on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus on her way home from work, before boarding she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her among the missing people worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
In this context, the police arrested one man several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he is suspected of, but it was not disclosed.
In four municipalities, new councils were established by the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region, and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the legally established number, or the elected councils have disintegrated.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the mandate.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
For the new elections to the representative bodies in the mentioned four municipalities, a total of 13 candidate lists were registered.
Of the 28 representative positions, 36 women and 63 men applied.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a fairly demanding but successful year for us.
In it, four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place, and above all, the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which required better equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpová, the 1st Vice-Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49 hours.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the voting results, and after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without any major issues.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population at all its levels approaches this issue, that's a problem I still have.
I am looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) the most because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He would be removed from the office of president and lose the ability to regain it.
The chance of that actually happening, however, is quite small, as others here have mentioned.
Moreover, I am not sure if the shredding of the file could even be considered high treason.
High treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people up to 35 years old who have been without sex for an entire year is increasing.
An increasing number of young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
This mainly concerns religiously-minded people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 years old who reported not having sexual intercourse in the past year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks, or video games could also contribute, making sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report that they did not have sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In married people, sexual activity is more frequent; for the year 2021, only 5% of them reported that they had been without sex in the last year.
In free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed to by the fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married men and women under 35 years old is still decreasing.
Young people are divided in their opinion on premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while approximately 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For the majority of those who have a moral issue with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious beliefs.
Since 2008, among free people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
"Among the 'less believing,' the trend has risen from 10 to 20%," Stone declared.
A decrease in sexual activity is also contributed by other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower among people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend mainly took hold during the lockdown in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole issue of mandating vaccination against Covid is about whether society should force a part of the population to engage in behavior they do not want, but which could save their lives.
It is a relatively difficult question, in which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he couldn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a stubborn vaccination opponent, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and KSC.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners most likely belong to the second group, so they will indeed be able to blame themselves for it.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, as the weather complicates even the preparation of the cross-country Jizerská Fifty race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a dog owner.
Once in high school, our teacher led us across the entire city to the shipyard so that we could ride on boats along the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street and guess who we saw in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they collapsed on us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but they started talking to one of my friends.
When she left them, we asked her along with the teacher what she had told them.
They asked me if I allegedly want to save my soul.
"I already told them that I have no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, according to the Chancellor, including within the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and uses people as human shields and weapons, as every night we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He negotiated with the chancellor about further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukashenko's regime.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to cover it up.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was driven by a different nun who tried to take the blame for it.
When the police informed her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving way while driving and leaving the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and after finding out that she had over two per mille in her blood, they immediately took away her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be testifying about her actions in court.
Hugo is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have become enamored with American stories about beloved dogs.
However, they forgot about an essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - the dog who taught people to live, another movie Here We Guard is now competing for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., freely follows up on his previous film "Tady hlídám já" from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo returns to the scene, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a dying Šumava guesthouse, start inviting dog owners, Julie's father with his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least there, the children and the dog were entertained.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to the dark delusions of wanting a child and, when the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide). Retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, accidentally shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken away from the hospital by her family so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Šumava wilderness, aided by a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, marvels at what a jumble of content, full of untrustworthy situations and characters, was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog owners' competition, a Šumava charlatan, police officers arriving to search for "drugs" based on a tip and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and of course, the cunning family at the guesthouse gets them drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits down with curled hair and makeup, smoking a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and meat as a cured vegetarian, one cannot help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "it sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build strong situations, a sense for character traits and punchlines, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is helpless, and the overall impression is messy.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, and Nela Boudová try to stand their ground, they don't have much to play.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a weak plot, and dog-like catchphrases, let alone more vulgar colloquial expressions that the characters indulge in.
The argument is not even the long-standing membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the lady producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That did not work out in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism for a good family picture and a minimum of emotion for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing precisely from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how little you understand it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such songs all the time, maybe you would change your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is troubled by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
For us, it is good.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
Also, it is the right Christmas setting, rejoiced the inhabitant of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sporadic and irregular.
The forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here," predicted Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, the number of tanker trucks is increasing.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," reported Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
In the Iranian Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has experienced the driest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister stated that the talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz announced that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the USA, is trying to persuade Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them."
About 3 years ago, this also happened to me.
I liked the young lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion about the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I bothered the young lady with doubts and questions for a while longer, and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me that I'm a rascal, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, where they were greeted with plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating thanks to that.
The skiers were not deterred by the obligation to show a COVID certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about a lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental shops report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Over the weekend, thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the running tracks and ski slopes.
The weather was favorable for skiers today, offering both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out since that Friday evening skiing when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the director of the Ještěd Sports Area, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend of skiing in the new season also to Jeseníky.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov and the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
The weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka, did not skimp on praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after recovering from COVID-19.
With a few exceptions, people are prepared for it and provide the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We have recorded only a few incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rental and sales shops.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
"It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers," said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
A greater influx is expected during the period of skiing courses.
Also, David Šinták, the executive of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
At this time before the pandemic, we were already almost in debt.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy due to the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental shop in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and now customers must reserve them in advance.
"We will start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already been calling in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the resort.
According to her, there is also interest in the ski school comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave for abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here as they would abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and capable people who have no property here are leaving for abroad.
The owner of the company won't just leave for abroad like that.
But I completely agree with the rest.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by several tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is about the elections at all.
If life gets bad here, some traditional V4 madman could also win.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose property cannot be stuffed into an airplane.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood due to a bet for beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew of The Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor published a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely unlike her behavior and we are starting to have great concerns about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We have immense concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," stated the group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Public cooperation is also called for by MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to Srncová's case during a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding in her hand a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I have a feeling that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was outside her home country, away from her family, and working here for our healthcare," said Harmanová.
Police had previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e., approximately 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like this either.
That's not a "huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you think that Russia wants war.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is so off in so many points that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it does not intend to comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to.
Oh no, agreements must be kept...
In Prague, new timetables have been in effect since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines emerged, some changed their route, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital city, express trains from České Budějovice have been stopping at Zahradní Město station since Sunday.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains will depart, which travel from Beroun to Český Brod through the Prague main railway station on their route.
At the recently opened station Prague-Zahradní Město, the express train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop.
PID will be newly expanded into other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy, and Turnov.
The buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be integrated, including lines extending into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 routes will be canceled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník was also established, replacing the canceled train line S53.
In the morning rush hour and on weekends, connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened, with the new express line number 404 being launched.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec region.
They are departing from Strizkov metro station, not from Holesovice Station.
The 400 paternal line goes through Mělník, Dubá, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on dozens of Central Bohemian local lines has been newly cancelled or limited, including to Mochov, Dobříš, or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are canceled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem, and around Kolín lines.
Changes are also awaiting passengers in other places.
Buses replace some canceled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk area have changed, and some bus routes on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
A healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket.
Hello, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option for getting food is to go next door to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Considering that I have no movement and I don't have the energy to exercise after work, I have to eat as healthily and dietetically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry, I buy at most a pizza bun and for a snack, yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that's how it is.
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily have to see.
Only the tip of the tree may be hidden under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about the relationship with Nedved: I was not looking forward to this at all.
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been living for nothing else but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They've been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans, in which she explains why she kept her love a secret from them for a long half-year.
"I dare to claim that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who is not aware that Dara caught a bear, I mean, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
Apparently, he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
This is what we both were not looking forward to, but we knew it would happen eventually, the singer continues.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's those who are not interested at all and it jumps out at them even from a can, or us, whose lives they dissect in great detail.
It's as if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend are a good match, or insisted that everyone really knows the list of your former partners in detail and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's a bug, you want it, it bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare for her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been serving as the vice president of the football club Juventus for a long time.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
With his wife Ivana, they had been separated for three years already, but they have only been officially separated for three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
And so I love my new man, and just as he stands by me, I stand by him too. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hello, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I just confirm that the dorms are great for the beginning, my classmates usually got to know and made friends during the first semester or two and then found shared apartments together, which seems to me the best option because you know who you will live with.
Flats are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you might not find much right now, but it certainly won't hurt to take a look at the offers.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and in that direction it's nice, plus it's close to most of the BUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you're enrolling).
So I've never looked for a rent myself, but I'm a native Brno resident, so I can help with Brno in general if you still need any information :)
That's quite an example of "normal" thinking for me.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually completely fine that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or let them follow the state's [curriculum] and have the state pay for it.
We cannot allow a private actor to control a part of the education system just because they add a few crowns to the full state contribution and thus be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when written by a person who, two days earlier, expressed themselves this way about a petition campaign for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
I would consult directly with the person who assigned you that work.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either estimate it by eye or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and add a note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it is quite readable, so I wouldn't completely recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it somehow in a note, depending on which program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But since it seems that you are drawing from some book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits what is physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it rather the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) than the OdryNian one?
PSS: Someone has already figured it out for you here.
Take a look at that comment with ΦΙΛH.
Politicians have no idea what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
That is a much worse mess than the fact that they will have interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because nobody understood some text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, it is a matter for lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with that English, it is quite interesting after the UK's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate towards Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's totally fine.
I often drive from work at 10 pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has hardly ever set foot there can say that it is a ghetto.
Well, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not that I would be afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the city center, I would definitely go for it.
Many apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and Gelemová's mistress like a pole in a fence!
Who will they spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dády's wreath and Lucie definitely has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, thus confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix, and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking to each other, so we didn't get to Christmas.
I really don't know where I will be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucie, probably perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the music video premiere at the Richman club by himself.
I am here alone, but I don't feel lonely.
"I always find someone to have a good time with," says Slováček, who was glad to meet the wife of Luďek Sobota, Adriana, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And are we Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are too few police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending only Ostrava is the fault of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought period in recent years.
According to scientists, there has been a decrease in water in mountain and submontane areas, and even places where there was no previous shortage of moisture are now experiencing lower precipitation levels.
The cause of the drought, which prevails in a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
The impacts are also intensified by the way we manage the soil.
What should we prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
If it's going to be like that, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I have no idea how to play hockey and the tactics (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also overall weird.
Whether you are the hockey team "Russian Bear" or "Chinese Lama", losing by two goals even when you don't have to win the match at all costs is different than when the score is tied.
But anyway, when I listen to Czech commentators pointing out what the referees notice or don't notice, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but I guess that's the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and since the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
The number of confirmed cases in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days is 1967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, the chief medical advisor for the UK Health Security Agency, on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
So far, no one has died from Omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
The leader of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by organizing a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December when the lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually" via computer.
Of course, groups of employees gathered around computers at Downing Street participated in it.
In Britain, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from the prime ministerial position.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them.
Paul Brand, commercial editor of ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a crushing majority in the general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable, how quickly the events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing spring elections that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
There will be elections of European-wide significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not like that.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and performs other smaller or larger tricks.
The latest one says that in practice, everyone can choose where they want to vote.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that there will be no room at all.
Do you think it will be just as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether they would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, in which he tells the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
Everything starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he snaps extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I used to get extremely angry as a child, to the point that I would lie on the ground in a cramp and turn completely blue. They probably took me under the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they slapped me for educational purposes, other times it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things violently now as well, when I was little I used to fight quite a bit, now at least I hit something to let off steam, and when I was younger I would, for example, slap my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get hit too much), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but upbringing certainly plays a role in it as well.
I'm afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and handle it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, perhaps every parent messes up something, it's probably not possible not to screw up your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
It doesn't offend me at all, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would therefore call those who create laws of such quality my clients.
Otherwise, I would be interested to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can it really be assumed that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage from?
Kočner's monstrous world.
How will the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak move Slovakia forward?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the case of the four defendants accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilized civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What fundamental change will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are hugely responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition of deans from all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No way, they let themselves be fooled and the company paid the price.

The next government is ending and the law on involving municipalities in the selection of a repository is nowhere.
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has come to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of deep geological repositories for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against deep repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding the repository, as promised to mayors since 2011 when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has at its disposal, is criticized by municipalities mainly for the following reason: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted draft concept almost completely neglects public involvement and turns the citizens of municipalities into mere extras in the permitting processes.
The proposal lacks a systematic compensation setting for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for the repository, its permitting, and operation.
Representatives of municipalities realistically do not have many options, according to today's legal standards, to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a location for a storage facility.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploratory or construction works.
The co-decision-making of local governments, which the Platform demands, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting repositories, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against Deep Geological Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the equalization of the position of local governments towards state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for that.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, as they perceive the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction similarly to the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) with the aim of promoting a change in the state's approach to handling spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited only to deep repository.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for potential storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Fear forced John Goodman (69) to lose weight: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, in the end, the doctors scared him.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And it took it away.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, according to The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," said the actor in a 2018 interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I'm reaching an age where I can't afford to sit still," Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss."
If it's about some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal text and perhaps an academic one, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss more.
There are several types of bosses for everything.
Perhaps a game like Dark Souls and similar has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all in order for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly confront them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that way?
And then there are mini bosses.
It is probably not possible to translate the word "boss" into a single word in Czech or other languages, as they do not address it in any way (an interesting exception is Catalan, which translates "boss" as the final opponent).
It is simply a generally significant, computer-controlled opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task for the story or game.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
They have been searching for a 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7th.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
So the whole world is searching for Petr.
"The Czech police are closely cooperating with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, slim, and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Local MP Harriet Harman also joined the search for Petra.
She participated in hanging up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We have huge concerns about her," she said at Saturday's press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
However, it is not clear who it is about and what they had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decrease in offensive campaigns, last month the attacks intensified significantly as the end of the year approached.
We recorded a large campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected email attachment is designed to attract the user's attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was labeled as "Copy of receipt corrections for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity is increasing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active as well.
Unlike Agent Tesla, in this case, the attackers are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November intercepted campaigns with a more global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month, with increased activity on November 3rd, 10th, and 15th.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt still appears.
An attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decline and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic for several months.

The procession in Prague was larger than the media reported.
Based on the footage of the parade along the embankment and my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid to estimate around 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment, the bridge, and the opposite waterfront road.
That means there are really a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the lasting dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding a common language.
Even the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and the like themselves would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the association Chcípl pes are gaining popularity, it reminds me of A Million Moments for Democracy upside down.
Sometimes I get the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be created from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a four or more dose one.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The triple-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose one, as it is clear that we will have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, which humanity is rightfully proud of.
At the end of the deadlock, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change with forming a new government, following their victory in the November elections.
Tom has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April when the previous government lost the elections under the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the "secretly" taken footage, it is a global hit.
In the UK over the weekend, concerns grew regarding the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by the London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British metropolis.
According to information about the children's hospital employee, not only the police but also her current employer and a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely unlike her behavior and we are starting to have great concerns about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We have immense concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," stated the group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
An anonymous person reported Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional Pirate Party councilor), for violating copyright with her murals.
The court has ruled that the Mole paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there has been a hole in the road in the shape of a channel without a cover for a month.
It was a matter of life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the RSD, to whom the road belongs, and because it allegedly did not respond, the hole remained gaping.
In the end, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to "intensively address the situation."
