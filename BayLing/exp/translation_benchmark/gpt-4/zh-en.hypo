Is there a way to punish him?
In order to prevent such a thing from happening again.
Or how much longer will it take for the restaurant to be ready? Can you help me ask?
At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students play the leading role, and their research achievements are mind-blowing - Xinhua News Agency
Wash hands with air, diagnose diseases by exhaling, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of innovative academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, covering various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education, etc. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biosensors: Your family health check doctor
The biomedical engineering doctoral student Zhang Diming's team demonstrated an on-site biosensor on a smartphone, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
All you need to do is take a gentle breath, and this set of instruments can preliminarily detect your health status from the components of the gas you exhale.
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
In the market, smart bracelets that can detect health conditions generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, which targets chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lamp: Doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
In response to the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights, the team of master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering have come up with a new approach and invented an intelligent LED shadowless surgical light.
Many diseases are not detected and removed early enough, which is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfei said that, for example, during early cancer screening, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will continue to spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the light spot according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: save water and be cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, at most rubbing some soap or squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand-washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air and let it out.
It's like an air pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean!
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue test show that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among numerous top universities in the world and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to make up for it as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, do not want points, will not use #PRS_ORG# again in the future!

He asked me to tell you his location.
I won't wait anymore, cancel the order.
I bought it from #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order
Alright, sorry for the trouble.
A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates that I think is important besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid is actually an emergency response when a sudden incident occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is most critical.
This is the time when emergency assistance is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's so important for people around to know first aid!
When someone around us falls down, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them, instead of standing there foolishly, unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
In China, according to official data, there are three million accidental deaths every year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the national average survival rate is 15%.
"In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%."
This is what the founder of First Response, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, stops breathing, and has no heartbeat, pinching the Renzhong acupoint will have no effect.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to possibly save a person.
I found that very few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can even save a person's life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Zhuhai Red Cross training center, and they even offer discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it has indeed been completed!
Next, I'm going to take exams for other certificates I want, such as a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. To take this exam, it seems that you need to have a first aid certificate first, so actually, the first aid certificate is quite useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
There is only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Never tried.
Why didn't #NAME# write it clearly?
One costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed delivering a meal, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
First of all, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a terrible film in every aspect, in every sense of the word.
But if you say that this movie doesn't have a single highlight, that's not true either, at least the soundtrack selection is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies: those that can put you to sleep in the cinema, those that leave you indignant after watching, and "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, as it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On the point of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly unparalleled in talent.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a K-series novel, indescribable, and full of flaws like the trench coat on Little Marco.
After watching it, you may even doubt whether there is any hidden metaphor implied by the director, but after careful consideration, you realize that it is actually just a pile of shit.
First, let me briefly talk about some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on each other with his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast in a minivan to see the snow.
Elderly people take a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very confident about this.
And then there was no follow-up from the old man.
How did the woman's brother manage to obtain a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's motorcycle gang hoodlums easily block a section of mountain road?
Then the truck carrying rebar in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small gangster with a bad credit record and suspected of illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
Why not call the police when facing high-interest loans? In the movie, the police even specifically asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner but can't find them, and ends up sleeping outside the room door for the night?
This inexplicable plot is filled throughout the entire film, and the absurdity of the plot makes me feel painful when I recall them.
Apart from the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the lack of a theme. It's just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think he wants to make a comedy. After 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you feel it could be a drama about the difficulties of young people living in a small town. After watching it, you have no idea what you've seen, and you're filled with deep self-doubt, wondering why you went to the cinema to watch crap during the holidays.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various types of movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, you can combine inspiration and comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a romance film, then just honestly tell the story of the entanglements between the small-town youth who loves riding motorcycles and the waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least, your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng played was burned, and then the character who can still sing cannot go through some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the female lead, she is clearly not mentally challenged, but in some aspects, she acts like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is one more thing that I don't quite understand: as a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is arranging such a movie during the Spring Festival meant to annoy the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment, Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, and well wall body module machinery, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we now have excellent quality and mainly produce hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment, Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment - Features and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used in new building materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example, various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks, and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of building inspection wells with concrete modules is that the modules have a concave-convex groove structure on all four sides (top, bottom, left, and right), forming a chain lock when combined and built.
The shear resistance of well wall masonry is far superior to that of smooth friction masonry construction.
The module has a hollow structure, and after being assembled and built, the vertical holes are connected, and the horizontal holes are penetrated. After the core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing role.
The module is equipped with slots for inserting reinforcements both horizontally and vertically, and the horizontal and vertical reinforcements correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, water leakage, and other phenomena. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming dimensions are standardized.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control is equipped with data input and output devices, one-key touch LCD display to monitor the entire mechanical operation process, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The well wall module mechanical hydraulic system adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of the main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system's operation.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment batching box advances the mold box to demold and rise, the storage box door is closed, the automatic conveyor pallet is transported, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing the wear and maintenance of the machinery.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing parts and hydraulic parts, ensuring the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The well wall module mechanical vibration platform uses an integrated steel plate, with the tabletop line cutting and no welding points, allowing the filling box to freely swing and guide, effectively reducing mechanical wear.
Reduce the load on the mold, combine filling and encryption amplitude, adopt integrated and fully synchronized, platform vibration and mold vibration, to ensure the achievement of solid vibration effect.
The well wall module mechanical vibration machine, computer automatic control amplitude adjusts the amplitude according to the raw material cost-performance ratio, with no wear and tear braking, thus extending the service life and reducing the cost.
The well wall module has both mechanical automatic control and manual control dual functions.

Chongqing vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeship system: enrollment means becoming a prospective employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted for pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-admitted as employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the dual status of apprentices as secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices aged 16 to 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties, as well as the specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job training of apprentices.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship model and collaborate with partner companies to carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for company employees.
The pilot schools need to reform the talent cultivation model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training period as a pilot cycle, and the internship time for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, with the general duration of the internship being 6 months.
In corporate practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can bring 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot program, training a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then promoting, gradually advancing from point to surface, we explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively improving students' job skills, and increasing the employment rate and quality of students in corresponding positions.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission power, most cases are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization consisting of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province reports that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs, which are similar to flu-like symptoms.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have needed to be hospitalized.
Pilai said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are originally more likely to develop severe illness due to coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to this, during the previous Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Two weeks after the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only 30% have severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while in the early outbreak cases in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, saying, "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early, and we need to obtain later-stage data."
Under normal circumstances, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Haoden Province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education Commentary: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy from the famous public service advertisement slogan "No trade, no killing," then in a good environment without the demand for "abduction," the collective prevention and treatment, and the nationwide anti-abduction efforts will make the abduction and trafficking activities unprofitable, high-risk, and high-cost, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the child abduction emergency information release platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an authoritative internet information platform created for the establishment of a missing children information release channel and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Upon hearing that this app is called "Reunion," I immediately felt a strong sense of warmth.
The new technology method is not only named "literary and artistic" and full of emotions, but also properly applied in informatization, practical and effective.
In combating human trafficking, the primary goal is to find and rescue the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed with many "big words".
But before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
In terms of priorities and urgency, under the urgent goal of "searching and rescuing," controversial topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punished with the death penalty" can be put aside for cautious discussion; however, the matter of rescuing abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers tend to quickly leave the crime scene after they succeed.
For every minute the search for the abducted child is delayed, the child may be one step further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases.
In this situation, adopting practical measures like the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps in solving cases and finding missing children, is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, "fighting against abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care for "protecting the young and supporting the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is when a family of three is resting at the train station, the parents fall asleep, and when they wake up, they find that their child is missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents taking turns to rest, or placing their children under reliable protection, are the most basic measures to prevent child abduction.
From the perspective of the police crackdown on trafficking crimes, the side of purchasing abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our country's Criminal Law, the statutory punishment for the crime of child trafficking starts at 5 years; in particularly serious cases, it can be up to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
With a high starting point for punishment and the heaviest sentence, under the general trend of "lighter punishment," the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to the more severe crimes.
But even now, there are still quite a few cases of abduction and trafficking happening every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated concepts in raising children and have a weak awareness of the law.
The legal education for this group of people should be carried out simultaneously and followed up.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on strict law enforcement by the government.
If the kidnapping "market" is widespread, the kidnappers will be blinded by greed, constantly innovating their methods, forming a "battle of wits" with law enforcement, and the anti-kidnapping operations will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking the backward mindset and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to eradicate the crimes of child trafficking and buying.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the rider's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Can't investigate
Hope you guys can understand a bit.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than displayed.
There is none left, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has already been changed.
He has been waiting for a long time.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories and five levels: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (also known as Refined Olive Oil).
First-press olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained by mechanically cold pressing and filtering fresh olive fruits to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The highest grade and highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity level not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity level of more than 3.3%, or it is also known as "secondary oil."
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, appearing as a transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is an olive oil obtained by extracting from the pomace through the solvent method and then refining it.
After seeing the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes used for making wine; olives from different regions and different varieties will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best growing area for oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive oil, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only sporadically cultivate in suitable areas.
Main producing area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as countries with similar climates in the southern latitudes, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
Olive oil harvesting month:
From March to June every year is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The fruit picking season is from November to February of the following year (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the fats discovered so far.
The Democracy Summit concludes, and Biden declares that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that the second Global "Democracy Summit" is planned to be held next year.
Taiwan government representative and Minister without Portfolio Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can face the challenges, because as I have said before, as this summit demonstrates, the democratic world is everywhere.
"Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom, as it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, better resist the buffering and impact forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, as well as fighting back against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day happens to be "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as our democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolutely condemning all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue paying attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been witnessing the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
"We must utilize all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Joshua Wong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you haven't realized the threat (the Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng attended a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values" and released the "National Statement" through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At the time when democracy in Taiwan is thriving, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, showing signs of a global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without having to lock down the city, and we can defeat fake information without having to remove it from the shelves.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were deemed to have seriously violated human rights. At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company that was found to have assisted in human rights violations using surveillance technology.
Already took a photo and uploaded it for you guys.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
It turns out that it needs #NUMBER#
So in short, I won't call anymore.
I won't eat anymore.
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you say earlier that you couldn't deliver it?
Waited for you for so long
No, I did not receive the call.
Please notify him to deliver it to our company again.
I don't want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
Waited an hour and a half for a meal.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price often has a positive correlation with the friendliness level. If you can't distinguish, then under normal circumstances, the expensive ones will be friendlier than the cheap ones. This kind of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't stand it, and it is difficult for experts to control.
The logic and hidden message behind their existence is - tennis is so difficult, they know you won't be able to learn it, and they also know you're not willing to buy expensive ones, so they make a cheap product to fool you. You'll play a couple of times and then you won't play again, so the racket is cheap and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have improved. At that time, come back to my place to buy the expensive ones, and I'll make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop brands, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets are not expensive, a new racket for 500-600 is good enough, a second-hand one for 200 yuan, isn't it nice to enjoy the pleasure of a thousand-yuan racket?
It's quite friendly for beginners, but once you pass the beginner stage, it becomes mediocre. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed for delivery multiple times.
May I ask if you can help with the follow-up?
Postpone
Thank you.
That is to say, actually I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Should I ignore the previous one?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing from the delivered food, and the saliva chicken was also raw.
Please cancel it as #PRS_ORG# asked me to pick it up for no reason, which is inconvenient.
The order I placed requested delivery, there was no such thing as self-pickup.

In fact, there are many dressing tips for girls with slightly plump bodies.
The skirt worn by a chubby girl should not be too short or too long; the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat part of the thigh.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear clothes that are divided into three sections - upper, middle, and lower - it will make you appear taller naturally. That is, if you use different colors for the top, skirt, and knee-high socks, it will create a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly overweight girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are a good way to hide your body fat. The elegant and noble black short skirt is also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black skirts, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are very fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too eye-catching.
The more popular, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
In order to avoid people noticing your legs and feet and getting the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to talk about the tips for good clothing collocation.
Chubby girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and also don't wear tops that are too short or tucked into the skirt, as it will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black long socks or fishnet stockings (the kind with small grids). Choose a soft-textured, printed flared skirt and pair it with a swing collar top, which can effectively cover the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, slightly chubby girls also have their own considerations when it comes to wearing short skirts.
Chubby girls wearing short skirts should choose a top with the same color as the skirt, as this will make your plump figure appear taller.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most fashionable combination in summer!
If you are a girl with a chubby upper body but skinny legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show your strengths.
An A-line short skirt will be slimming and is more suitable for plus-size girls. Choose a tighter top to create a sense of layering, which will make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can also be tried by plus-sized girls.
Slightly chubby girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing and matching, slightly chubby girls can also become the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing collocation, also exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of slightly overweight girls as soon as possible 😄

"Girl becomes a target for her sister's fundraising: 'Thinking that it's just a flesh wound makes it better' - Xinhua News"
In Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a large wooden board, on which is written "Human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow."
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl willingly becoming a "target" to raise funds for her sister went viral in the friend circle.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board reads "Human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow," indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior has sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity at the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl took such extreme actions to raise funds for her sister, but this behavior is not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl has already left the local police station yesterday.
The girl who fundraised on the street with an "arrow target" was warned.
In the picture circulated on the internet, a long-haired girl is standing in a "human" shape in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink "Human flesh target, 10 yuan per arrow." In front of her, another wooden board displays her bank account number, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture sparked controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a "begging behavior for attention", while many others have expressed sympathy for it.
We discovered the situation around 10 am on the 23rd when we were patrolling near the square, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time.
The police officer from Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls running the stall, both around 20 years old, dressed youthfully and beautifully.
Among them, the girl who was being a "human target" kept crying, asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was helping to shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, asking everyone for help.
We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity at the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Ji Jiali, and she is raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in expenses, and they couldn't think of a good way to raise funds for a while, they resorted to this kind of behavior.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were involved - one as the target and the other as the assistant, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people were watching and took photos, which were posted on Weibo.
After the police's identification through the public security department, the used bow and arrow do not belong to the controlled category.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate using this kind of attention-grabbing fundraising method."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has already left the police station.
Heat dissipation effect: Good. Thinness: Convenient. Appearance material: Satisfactory. Acer has always had a high cost-performance ratio.
The new machine is very good.
Stable performance, no problem with the cooling of the four air outlets, worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with solid craftsmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The price of the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is not considered expensive.
I personally think that the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. The gaming performance is smooth and it can handle most games. My PUBG runs at a stable high frame rate, which is very smooth. League of Legends is even easier to handle, and CS:GO is also easily competent. Most AAA games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is very powerful, it's quite quiet for work, and when playing games with full effects, the fan is still not small.
Appearance material: The appearance is quite cool, the gaming laptop is just stylish. Display effect: The screen is very clear, playing games at 1080 is enough.
Buying this laptop feels pretty good, it's really nice. It's mainly used for design work, and the cost-performance ratio is very high. It's lighter than I imagined and looks better than I expected. The red color on the back is a very beautiful wine color, not too garish. Overall, it exceeds my expectations by a lot, and it's quite worth the purchase. It's also quite suitable for women.
Started using Acer Aspire Dark Knight 2 years ago, after two years of use, the cost performance is relatively high, and the quality is excellent!
I also recommend my friends around me to buy this product!
We have already purchased 3 models from this series!
The appearance is beautiful and good-looking, and the configuration is also very good.
Bought it for my nephew, originally wanted to wait for the 418 bank event, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I missed the big bank event, which is a bit regrettable.
However, the cost performance is quite high, and the logistics are quite fast. Let's come back to review after using it for a while.
A brand new, original, and cost-effective gaming laptop with a great design style, already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought for the child to use for 3D rendering, the software is already installed, the child said it can be used without any problems, this computer can handle 3D design work performance.
Bought it for my son, he said it's very good.
The computer is quite good, especially the customer service attitude is very good. If you don't understand, just ask. I recommend purchasing.
Not bad, the graphics quality of the game is really good.
What was the hottest thing in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A while ago, an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Olympic Gold Medals" was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can absolutely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, while firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more commonplace.
This seemingly joking and teasing article actually reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing their inability to cope with the current project management work.
Personnel engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take some actions to free themselves from the predicaments in their work.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional) registrations each year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20 Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® exam applicants in China reached nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 people passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certification total.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" from the past. The ever-changing work environment tells us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can obtaining a PMP certification guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas and five major process groups of project management and other related knowledge points. However, when it comes to actually managing projects, they still find themselves in a fog.
Many project managers often report the following issues: insufficient understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to put them into practice; lack of systematic project management process and institutional support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and projects being delayed; unclear division of labor among team members, not knowing how to deal with "old hands" in the team, poor cross-departmental communication and collaboration, making it difficult to advance the project...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than a decade, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won honorary titles such as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base".

Jie Xin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival saw a total of 1.77 trillion yuan in online payment transactions nationwide, setting a new record compared to previous years.
A wide variety of discount coupons and eye-catching live-streamed sales events once again made consumers exclaim about the benefits they gained. On one hand, this consumption craze makes people marvel at the increasingly strong national consumption power; on the other hand, it also forces people to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and to reject blind and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, the financial consumption performance of residents in our country is relatively good, but there are significant differences in various aspects of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and the "old and young" will still be the key focus of continuous attention in financial education. The "China Young People's Debt Status Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, and although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, it is quite different from the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world. However, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behaviors, which have resulted in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave in taking on social responsibilities and providing positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jie Xin has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls, taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially the younger generation.
In the past several years, Jie Xin has been continuously carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for the youth group, including college students, and has been subtly and reasonably guiding the consumption needs of the young group through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan consumption needs, and thus accumulate wealth for their lives.
As Double Twelve approaches, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a rational consumption awareness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the pitfalls of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, be sure to plan ahead, spend within your means, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as buying a car and purchasing a house.
Meanwhile, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, and assist consumers in cultivating rational consumption and moderate borrowing concepts, becoming a lifelong trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where all Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait, moving towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab countries resolve their differences to restore relations with Qatar, based on the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During this visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 Memoranda of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincides with Iran's negotiations with major world powers to save the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab countries because they believe it cannot resolve the issue of Iran's missile program.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and consider Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that it is flawed not to address the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to satisfy the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and to propose various measures to enable its member countries to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Claimed to be the loudest supercar exhaust sound in the new mountain area!
This time, the car our team brings to everyone is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, the annual road tax is over ten thousand Malaysian Ringgit, it has four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
Well, I don't know either, but the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. So, when my Myvi reaches 30km/h, others have already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the unobstructed view of the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the car models, just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily provide!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is looking, very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is around RM1 (car owners basically don't care).
Practice getting on and off the vehicle, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you might not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is so loud that you will go deaf as soon as you get out of the car. (But it's still very cool)
The car body is too big, it will be very narrow when parked in a regular parking space, and I'm afraid it will be hit when the car next door opens the door!
A bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (said by the editor themselves, unrelated to the car owner, haha).
Everyone, please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!
For more car information you don't know, check out The Car Guide / People's Car Journal.
Involving a car accident worth tens of millions!
Car enthusiasts must be familiar with the Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of the Porsche 911 is also at the million-dollar level!
Before that day, millions of sports cars like the 911 and tens of millions of supercars like the Chiron were crashed within just a few minutes abroad!
Looking at the results, you do have a point!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in its long-term development process, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which emerged during the crisis of the nation, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the values of "cultivating virtue to benefit the world, and promoting peace and order" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting education to strengthen the country."
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important "supply side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "Overall Plan for Coordinated Advancement of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move from a major higher education country to a powerful higher education country, but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of world-class institutions in a shorter period of time, accelerate the establishment of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to having firm confidence in goals, paths, and capabilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages: First, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and education quality; Second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom and connotations accumulated in the 5,000-year-old Chinese civilization, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, and using this to gather strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; Third, the institutional advantage, leveraging the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven efforts, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate their progress towards the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be done in a one-size-fits-all manner. Each school must highlight its individuality and characteristics while leveraging its strengths.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have the common Chinese characteristics but also reflect their unique goal orientation, educational traditions, and resource endowment.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of our characteristics in running the school: First, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment that combines science, education, and industry, and forming a complete entrepreneurial education ecosystem; Second, we highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary integration, and actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; Third, we emphasize the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seeking Truth and Innovation," the common values of "Diligent Learning, Cultivating Virtue, Discerning Truth, and Being Practical," and the shared vision of "Embracing Diversity, Pursuing Truth and Virtue, Pioneering New Frontiers, and Serving Our Nation" together form the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the ambition of "using the talents of the world for my own purposes", and manifests as drawing on the high-quality concepts of running schools and educating people from world-renowned universities; "Qizhen Houde" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also accepting the cultivation of morality and the tempering of personality; "Kaiwu Qianmin" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research innovation, as well as reform and development, and the transformation of old and new; "Shuwo Bangguo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, stating that universities should always share the same fate with the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is precisely the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
The wise can hear the silent, and the insightful can see the unformed.
Chinese universities should further establish themselves in the overall situation of China's characteristic socialist cause, deeply grasp the era orientation and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to the humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit interact with each other, thus providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Guangxi University students can take up to 5 years off for entrepreneurship - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19 (Reporter Zhang Ying) - The reporter recently learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Department of Education that in the future, universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, relax the suspension of study for college students, and extend the suspension of study for entrepreneurship for students by 2 to 5 years based on the original academic system. The time for suspension of study for entrepreneurship can be regarded as practical education time.
In order to promote the improvement of college students' entrepreneurial and innovative abilities, departments such as education and human resources in Guangxi have joined forces to build entrepreneurial platforms, construct more off-campus practical teaching bases for college students, university science and technology parks, college student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, providing external guarantees for college students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in various universities should reach more than 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 2,000 square meters for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes supporting students with outstanding performance in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to change their majors.
High school teachers need to spend at least two months in industry enterprises every two years to improve their awareness and ability in innovative and entrepreneurial education.
The Autonomous Region Education Bureau requires universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training program, striving to enable every college student to participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school years.
High schools should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

At the time when NFTs quickly gained popularity, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Southeast Asia region, and some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn a stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, incorporating various gameplay elements including NFTs. It is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with over 3 billion US dollars in transactions to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching "King of Glory."
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity's official claimed that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" introduces a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single characters. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game's ecosystem.
This kind of subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a piece of news about a friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway is that companies should choose their industry wisely when it comes to investment targets. Firstly, they should choose industries with large growth potential, at least with a market size of over 100 billion; secondly, they should choose industries with good future growth prospects, considering those that will reach their optimal growth state in the next 3-5 years; finally, they should choose industries with government support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics are about "doing the things right," which means doing things correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which means doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics are about implementation, and above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of increasing event participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right event KPIs, achieve the right event goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value dormant customers, and accurately acquiring new customers; on top of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin experienced several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the Central American small country El Salvador designated Bitcoin as legal currency, making it the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved for the first time in eight years the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market, further expanding the exposure of cryptocurrency investments.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Asian American groups file complaints against Yale and 3 other Ivy League schools for admissions discrimination - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - More than 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against discrimination against Asian applicants in the admissions process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of prestigious American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies show that these universities, in their so-called "holistic admissions" process, have been "long-term and systematically discriminating against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yukong explained that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, the admission rate of Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the universities being complained about will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
At present, the three universities being complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese American groups, this appeal also involves educational groups from Indian Americans, Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, and Pakistani Americans.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zheting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agency. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, after discussing the details of purchasing the factory building with the family member of the property owner, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Building Deposit Receipt," which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit will belong to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller at double the amount. Both parties agree to sign the factory building sales contract within one week."
However, due to the inability to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory building sale and the payment method, the house purchase and sale contract has not been signed.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After much difficulty, Mr. Lu finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit, and prepared the payment. All that was left was to sign the contract with "one foot in the door," but the seller suddenly refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu both helpless and angry.
In response to this, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Lin at the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court, after hearing, held that the failure of both parties to sign a formal contract cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably inferred that the negotiations were unsuccessful. Therefore, the case should not be subject to the penalty for earnest money, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability for breach of contract by returning double the earnest money.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of due diligence and prudence.
When signing the contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and other relevant information. The specific time and place of delivery should be clearly stated in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday (December 11) that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing lines based on ideology, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, practicing anti-democracy under the guise of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts." (Deutsche Welle Chinese)
The Chinese government believes that, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', abused unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to participate, including Taiwan's leader, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also international and domestic doubts and criticisms, such as questioning the invitation of some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes in organizing this summit.
The newly-appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit.
The statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is showing its pathological state, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party conflicts, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and wealth disparity becoming increasingly severe," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a foundation of capital.
In his speech, U.S. President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, better resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not to be taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it among every generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that as global democracy and human rights "face persistent and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign following this democratic summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support for independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the in-person Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all countries implement our commitments and report the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent it to the wrong address.

Friends who like desserts must try the "Dongjiang squid stuffed tofu pot". The soup is very delicious, the tofu is very tender, and the ink...
Great taste, good meat, enthusiastic service.
It's been a long time since I've been to Rìchāng, the fruit salad is still so delicious & made with genuine ingredients. It's my first time ordering a BBQ pork bun, and it has the soft, southern-style flour taste that I love!
The claypot rice has just the right amount of moisture, the portion is very generous, the signature tin foil chicken wings are as good as always, the soup is also good, and the kale is handled relatively well...
Great taste, enthusiastic service, and good quality meat.
Ri Chang Lao Dian was an internet celebrity many years ago, with its Dongdan Xiaolou and wooden floors.
You always have to wait a long time at the entrance to eat the clay pot rice, and the clay pots of the clay pot rice are even cracked...
Haven't been to Rìchāng for several years, the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a seat in the restaurant as soon as you arrive, the quality of the dishes is beyond words, as always, it's great.
Great taste, good meat, and great staple food.
Ri Chang Takeout.
Rice meal: This time the dishes were a little bit disappointing.

What is the drinking method for Red Label Whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like collecting, some people like gourmet food, and of course, some people like tasting wine. Red Label Whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of red label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, isn't it a waste of its mellow aroma?
So how do you drink Red Label Whiskey?
Let me give you a brief introduction.
Red Label Whiskey drinking method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is blended from about 35 kinds of Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and traditional Scotch whisky characteristics, featuring a strong fragrance with sweet and smoky flavors.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be consumed directly with ice, or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Label whiskey enters the domestic market, and in order to cater to the taste of the locals, Red Label whiskey + cola or Sprite or other carbonated drinks become a long-lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing acidity, can visually bring pleasure to people, and when added to beverages, they can dilute the taste of alcohol and change the mouthfeel.
Red label whiskey + sliced lemon + cube sugar (granulated sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red square flavor is a bit sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three methods are the best ways to drink Red Label whiskey. Everyone can use them as a reference and give them a try. We hope that the introduction provided by the editor can help everyone.
Educational thinking: How can college entrance exams allow "top students" and "poor students" to find their place - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about university exams, and proposed to increase the difficulty of exams, change the types of exam questions, and let exams truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college entrance exams have been a "hot topic."
In the university campus, students come from all corners of the country with varying abilities and different levels of education, resulting in a wide range of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, have a high repetition rate, and are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
A student who doesn't study hard may be able to pass the exam by cramming at the last minute. If they try other methods, they might achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, a "strange phenomenon" arises where "poor students" can pass and even get high scores without putting in effort, while "top students" who never miss classes and have good homework and notes don't score much higher in exams.
In this case, it seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University's reflections on the problems in university exams are not unfounded, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs up to these three students who wrote letters to express their opinions directly.
In fact, people who have attended college are well aware that it is not uncommon to see phenomena such as cramming for exams, trying various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, striving to narrow down the scope of the exam, and seeking "key guidance" before the exam. Even cheating with cheat sheets during exams and asking teachers for leniency after the exams are not unheard of.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, measuring whether a university exam is qualified or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Upon entering the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on fundamental knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether or not one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in university exams.
The undergraduate knowledge mainly consists of basic theoretical foundations and common sense of the discipline. In terms of knowledge points, the room for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics learned 20 years ago is still being studied today and remains a key focus."
Although the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, it does not mean that the exam question types are single and the test questions are repetitive.
In many universities, exams are usually organized by a question-setting group, and then the test papers are compiled by experienced teachers in the subject. The grading of the exams is also participated in by all the teachers responsible for the subject, which can to some extent overcome the problem of repeated questions.
To create a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed based on the overall situation of the students' learning. It is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation, fully analyze the students' learning level, and dynamically control the difficulty and question types of the exam. This way, the exam can not only emphasize the examination of basic knowledge but also take into account the assessment of abilities while innovating the design of question types.
Exams are the baton of university education; whatever kind of exam there is, students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Regarding the suggestion letter from students, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has already deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
The requirements are for each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out research and discussion, and to conduct self-examination in comparison with the final exams of the courses. They should also formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, while strengthening the supervision and inspection of the examination paper proposition and review process. Furthermore, they should refine the grading evaluation and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Addressing the issue of single test question types and repeated questions in college examination mechanisms is a topic that needs to be faced, and corresponding systems need to be introduced. However, the key lies in daily efforts, requiring teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. It is not only necessary to fully understand the teaching content, but also to fully understand the students' learning situation. By fully understanding both aspects, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a positive interaction, and exams will be more in line with reality, allowing both "top students" and "struggling students" to find their place.
If it is not possible to change the branch location for me, can it be changed to delivery?
So I don't have to pay extra money, right?

Jin Furen Wedding Photography (Nan Street Store) currently has no branches.
Before taking the photos, we didn't arrange our time well and changed the time twice. Consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Jin's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time in my life that I had put on makeup formally, wow~ I couldn't believe that one day I would become so beautiful, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super patient with makeup, and their makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scene was shot in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and we didn't feel very cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headdresses, and would immediately help us tidy up if there was anything slightly off.
The photographer is also very humorous, and we feel very happy after a day of taking pictures.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos. But when we were choosing photos, really, there was no intention to let us add photos at all. We directly chose 24 photos from the package, without adding any extra ones. (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to her 7,000+ package. I was shocked at the time and was afraid that I would choose too many photos myself.)
The photos were fixed today, and Lanlan sent them to me. I saw two that I didn't think were very good, and they immediately helped me fix them again.
After comparing the photos taken of my sister before, I feel really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and refreshing, just the style I want.
I highly recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Furen to take wedding photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have your sincere wishes for your happiness and well-being, and a bright future like a brocade!
How much does this set cost?
What conditions need to be met in order to use that $32?
That's good, no need for a refund then.

Sabah 3,200 newborns without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, November 11) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeiting paper stocks, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since the beginning of October, affecting a total of 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Ke Lu Aminu, assured that all the information of the babies who have applied for the birth certificate has been recorded in the system, and it will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the issue of Sabah newspaper's paper printing problem, which was reported by an online media outlet for as long as 10 months.
He said that the related issue had emerged two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of the special anti-counterfeit paper is affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in its arrival in our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by Sabah newspaper is different from other regions, so they cannot borrow the inventory from other states.
Kairul Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and immediately proceed with the final stage of printing upon returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20th) to deliver them to the applicants.
We will notify the applicants to go to the local branches to collect the birth registration papers.
He added that a total of 24,801 birth certificates have been issued in Sabah so far this year.
I've been waiting since a little after 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost there?
I mean food.
I am waiting again across from #PRS_ORG#.
Okay, thank you, the restaurant said it's ready.

In the past year, the world has experienced unprecedented changes in a century and the global pandemic of COVID-19 has intertwined, making the external environment more complex and severe. The tasks of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic and promoting economic and social development in our country have become extremely heavy and arduous.
The Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has insisted on coordinating both domestic and international situations, adhering to the overall tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, calmly dealing with the changes of the century and the global pandemic, coordinating epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, strengthening macro-policy cross-cycle adjustments, focusing on promoting the sustained and healthy development of the economy, deepening reform, opening up and innovation, and striving to complete the arduous tasks of reform and development. The Party and the country have achieved new major achievements in various undertakings.
The "14th Five-Year Plan" has achieved a good start, which is reflected in an important aspect: taking new steps in building a new development pattern and achieving new results in high-quality development.
Our country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintain a global leading position, with the characteristics of strong resilience, great potential, and sufficient momentum continuing to emerge; the national strategic scientific and technological strength is accelerating, major innovative achievements are emerging one after another, the ability of scientific and technological innovation is continuously improving, and new breakthroughs have been made in tackling key core technologies; the resilience of the industrial chain has been enhanced, the quantity and quality of foreign trade have increased, the structure has continued to optimize, and the new momentum represented by new industries, new forms of business, and new models has grown and expanded; reform and opening up have deepened, focusing on breaking through the bottlenecks that restrict the adaptation of supply and demand and the flow of factors, and creating new advantages in cooperation and competition with a high level of openness to the outside world; people's livelihood security is strong and effective, the scale of employment continues to expand, residents' income growth is basically synchronized with economic growth, the annual grain output has been maintained at more than 1.3 trillion jin for seven consecutive years, achieving "18 consecutive bumper harvests"; the construction of ecological civilization continues to advance, the work of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality is coordinated and promoted, the pace of green and low-carbon transformation is steady, and new achievements have been made in ecological and environmental protection.

Educational Information: Beijing reduces the proportion of students with special talents entering junior high school in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination work for junior high school students with special talents in Beijing was uniformly organized and implemented by the district education committees.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the enrollment ratio for students with special talents, making the competition for these students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, this year the proportion of primary school students entering junior high school with special talents in the district will not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students arriving at school will not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students with sports, art, and technology expertise who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent enrollment examination.

The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination area, and the time periods are divided by hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points according to the time periods and take the examination in different examination areas and rooms.
On May 23, the District Education Enrollment Examination Center published the list of students who passed the examination online. Students can check their examination results online.

Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Chairman: Firmly believe that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during special times - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11 - The Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently stated that Bosnia is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during this special period.
A few days ago, Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ji Ping, met with the Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of the China-Poland relationship and said that he visited China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and was deeply impressed by the excellent organization work of the Chinese side. He firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during this special period. The Polish side is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing participation. The Polish side hopes to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Jiping said that China and Belarus have a special "Olympic bond."
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and in just two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also kick off, presenting a simple, safe, and exciting event to the world.
Looking forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation of winter sports events, athlete training, and other aspects, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridging role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, allowing the people of both countries to "move towards the future together", and wishing the Bosnian and Herzegovinian athletes good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, and Ji Ping, as a special guest, presented the award to the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video of the Beijing Winter Olympics is played on a loop at the event site.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, setting up "buffer zone": The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) - The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours. People going to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, region, and city determines the scope of port cities and announces it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the exchanges between the border residents of both sides are frequent.
Implement differentiated management policies by region, changing from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, in the hope of achieving a forward shift in the critical point, reducing the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The aforementioned notice pointed out that this exposes some issues such as untimely monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, ineffective closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, perfunctory regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items at various stages, non-standard management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficiently scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in 9 aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures. It also calls for speeding up the improvement of weak points in port city prevention and control, not relaxing, and scientifically and accurately carrying out prevention and control work, so as to weave a tight and solid defense line against the importation of the epidemic from abroad.
The notice emphasizes that cities at various ports of entry should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the work of safeguarding people's livelihood, announce and smooth the hotline for safeguarding people's livelihood, regularly investigate potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly address and proactively respond to prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include open land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, states, leagues), and municipalities directly under the central government. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Uncovering the truth behind the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree in a video on YouTube - Xinhua News Agency
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11th, a short documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan war under the guise of "counter-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, and committing various crimes against humanity over 20 years of impoverishing soldiers, being bloodthirsty, and indiscriminately killing innocent people.
Abusing drone strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and forming killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black prison" where various tortures and humiliations are inflicted on "suspects."
One by one, crimes against humanity are fueling more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "the more you fight, the more you fear."
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, and hope to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let's expose the truth of the United States' bloody killings under the name of "anti-terrorism" together, and puncture the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and a storage period perspective why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning. Although canning is considered deep processing and does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies, perhaps the following text can explain why the customer wants to do this?
I visited many milk powder factories and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, there is no difference at all.
So everyone must be wondering: Why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or another question: Why is there such a big price difference between the boxed and bagged versions?
In fact, starting from this point, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that the more expensive ones are better.
Some consumers, with this mentality, have tried it and responded that the taste or texture of the imitation product is indeed different!
Now let me first explain to everyone the reason for the high cost, where is the high cost?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them take into consideration that if the price of bagged products is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept. This means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or even non-existent. So, what do manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they had a significant increase in the pricing of the equipment to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote the listening device, not the bagged one.
In addition, the advertising fees of the manufacturers you think of are tens of millions or even billions every year. Where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine, everyone knows.
So with the development of society, the marketing costs, such as: the promotion staff in shopping malls, the display costs in shopping malls, the cost of product giveaways, advertising costs, etc., are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are listening to the installation. The prices are also constantly rising. In fact, these new products are emerging with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary, collaborating with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products, and making profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
And the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operation methods, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bagged milk powder and store it in a container at home. This can save costs and improve the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on the children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of canned products is longer than that of bagged ones. After opening, the shelf life of canned and bagged products is the same. It's just that bagged products are not easy to store after opening and are more susceptible to moisture and spoilage.
The food delivery was late, the food got cold, and after it got cold, it became dry and hard, making it completely inedible.
And the soup even spilled out.
Cancel it immediately, the stuff he #PRS_ORG# sent must have gone cold.
I've never taken it!

That time keeps getting delayed.
I don't know when to wait until.

How do I pay the service fee to the rider?
Over an hour ago, it was confirmed that there was a rider.
I don't want to wait any longer.
Don't scare people off at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When browsing a book market, you can often feel the popularity of success-related books.
Nowadays, many success books advocate the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "achieve it", and then tell you "what" you need to achieve.
In other words, it skipped the most important and fundamental step of "how to achieve it" all at once.
Therefore, these books all have one thing in common - either do your best in one go, or don't do anything at all; either it's 100, or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" is so undeniably correct that anyone who sees it will admit it, but it scares off 99% of people before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, start over, and make a 180-degree change," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to conventions, resist change, and refuse to adapt, shouting "you need to change" in their ears is undoubtedly self-deceiving and like playing the lute to a cow.
The vast majority of people will show fear in the face of the word "change" and hesitate to move forward, finding it difficult to make up their minds; or they may make the decision to "change" impulsively and bravely take the first step, but often the good times don't last long, and they can't persist for much longer before they are defeated, making it difficult to see any sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way that may allow more ordinary people to embark on the path of relative success.
The core of the "next best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories for a big victory", that is, if you can't achieve 100, it's okay to achieve only 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that's still better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it has become more possible for ordinary people to persist, and as long as one persists in anything, the probability of success will increase.
The only difference is that the path to success following the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" seems to advocate for the success of everyone on the surface, in reality, it can only motivate a minority; whereas the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
The phone call is unanswered.
Constant delays
It hasn't been delivered yet.
Excuse me, when will it be delivered?
How to contact?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He missed delivering two meals, but one order has been completed.
I would like to ask, how do I contact the rider?
Just now, the first rider told me that there should be another rider delivering again.
The reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002, the cumulative growth has been more than 40 times.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huang fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake and plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the increasingly deteriorating environment of the naked carp breeding waters, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. By 2002, the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "China Species Red List".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a lake closure policy for fish breeding, prohibiting any organization, collective, or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and banning the sale of naked carp and its products.
Meanwhile, by adopting measures such as artificial breeding and releasing, cleaning the main river channels flowing into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passages," the protection efforts have been continuously strengthened, and the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially propagated and released naked carp have been accumulated in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the western region.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing ban notices for key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one river, one lake."

Just saw an article about menstrual leave, it's too long.
Popularize some knowledge for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstruation on a certain day between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, under the premise of good health, it will come regularly once a month.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately, with a tolerance of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes bad luck can cause a turnover (suddenly advancing several days).
The duration, blood volume, and degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, while others have it for a week; some people have a small amount of blood flow, while others have a heavy flow; some people have no reaction, while others are in so much pain that they need to be taken away by an ambulance. Menstrual pain can change over time, and just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt for the rest of your life.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it involves bleeding 24 hours a day for several days from the beginning to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen quickly when the menstrual period has just begun and before the pain starts can effectively relieve the pain for that month. Taking it after the pain has started is not very useful.
Before menstruation, due to excessive congestion of the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the cycle and you suddenly have diarrhea, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst-case scenario is changing 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 pads. If you include the extra pads prepared in advance, there may be 50 pads, so it's not just one pad per month.
(Here's a revision: sanitary tampons do not need to be changed frequently, changing them every five to six hours is fine, and the longest duration should be eight hours.)
During menstruation, hormonal changes may cause irritability, and emotional instability may also occur during ovulation due to hormonal fluctuations in the body. It's really unfortunate, as if the body is tripping itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, it also contains shed endometrial lining.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. This can be understood as the uterus being a house, and every month the house (endometrium thickens) is built to welcome guests. If the guests don't come, the entire house is demolished (menstruation is discharged), and a new house is built the next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, lasting for several decades, with a few days of 24-hour bleeding every month, and accompanied by abdominal and back pain. Who would want that?
However, a person is born because his mother has had menstruation, and menstruation is to prepare the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should be grateful to their mothers for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the female body's preparation for nurturing life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like this anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in their lives, and who don't understand it well, should not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their mothers with such an attitude, and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary tampons, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, sending the wrong gift is quite disappointing.
Need to order additional meals for the children to eat.
Hope the store can check the products in the midst of their busy schedule.
Does the foot bath make your feet numb because of a leakage of electricity?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a very good foot therapy health care effect. Today, Guomei's editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged in the market. Foot baths ranging from over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan are available, providing consumers with a great deal of choice.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are booming. However, there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
Soaking your feet in electrified water is really too dangerous, isn't it!
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath tub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness on the soles of his feet while soaking them.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there are no clear and detailed industry regulations for this long-popular foot bath in terms of the highest temperature setting, the applicable population, and the harmless guarantee of materials.
But in general, foot bath tubs will not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that a few products may not have been strictly controlled during production.
Therefore, choose a split-type foot bath tub when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can also use an electric pen to test at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily reported on December 10 (All-media reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) that this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Hua Hong Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint towards the 100 billion tea industry goal.
Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Hou Shunli and Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee Ye Hongzhuan attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Academician Liu Zhonghua, a professor of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: The origin of Hong Lake is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new vitality into the "Colorful Hunan Tea."
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of a 100 billion yuan tea industry in Hunan, and forming a development pattern of "three Hunan, four waters, and five colorful teas."
In the province's tea industry, innovation is being intensified, with major tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to exert their strength. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
The wheel of fortune turns, and black tea gains strength again.
Tea industry experts in the province say that after harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is rising straight.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua proudly held the "source of Hunan Red Tea."
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant took a fancy to a high-mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the perspective of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
The new red tea brings a touch of red, infusing the tea culture with connotations, enjoying popularity and brisk transactions. The Hunan tea industry is welcoming a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore, because there is no parking below, he couldn't bring it up.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation "形而上学" comes from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in "Yijing - Xici Shangzhuan", which was translated from the word "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro during the Meiji era.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related extended issues.
Ontology is the study of "which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
The theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and the theory of evolution.
The methodological naturalism refers to the research method that does not mention God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the physical body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline that systematically thinks about and studies human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
The main divisions are meta-ethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or critiques) and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and providing moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies the moral behavior guidelines that people should follow, applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information on how people live and drawing conclusions from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theoretical perspective, but rather investigates the actual choices made by moral agents and the moral factors that contribute to these decisions, as well as the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic ethical thought, represented by people such as Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: The ethical thought of the religious reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others; Modern Ethics (17-18th centuries, British Empiricist Ethics, represented by Hume and others; 17-18th centuries, Continental Rationalist Ethics, represented by Spinoza and others; 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, represented by Voltaire and others; 18-19th centuries, German Academic Ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel and others; 18-19th centuries, British Utilitarian Ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick and others; 19th century, British Evolutionary Ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley and others; late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian Ethics, represented by Rickert and others; late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian Ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green and others); Transitional Period Ethics (Irrationalist Ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche and others).
Logic is a discipline that studies the "principles and standards of valid inference and proof."
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, causal reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and significance of beauty.

Sheep Walks (chè), real name Jiang Bo, was born in the Year of the Sheep and the Month of the Sheep. He walks on the grass, finding his place, hence the name Sheep Walks. People call him "Uncle Sheep."
Due to the publication of the "Exotic Code" series, including "Thai Exotic Tales," "Indian Exotic Tales," "Japanese Exotic Tales," and "Korean Exotic Tales," he is known as a "mystery genius" in the industry and claims to be "good at talking nonsense seriously."

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the tragedy of our relatives. Especially since I issued a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, the assistance has never been interrupted until now.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started families, and found jobs.
It is your righteous actions that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging across the globe, and most of the donors have already reached retirement age.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to stop providing humanitarian donations to our suffering group - the Tiananmen Mothers, as this humanitarian aid activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always cherish your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please understand, my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye'an: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-American Students Association and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often overlap.
(Apple Daily Picture: Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Rescue funds often cannot be smoothly delivered to the hands of the families of the June 4th incident victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was formed by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund." After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then established the "June 4th Distressed Elderly Special Assistance Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from campus and social donations during the June 4th incident, generous individual contributions, and is supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the families of the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4th from Hong Kong.
During this period, "China Human Rights" is also independently implementing their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called for a halt to the June 4th donations, considering the donors. We are indeed all retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude for Teacher Ding's letter "To Friends."
We will respect the decision of the bereaved families, terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately when needed.
To those chivalrous comrades who have been generously donating and risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years, we express our gratitude and respect.

Member evaluation
Photo effect: Took pictures of two sets of clothes, overall it's not bad, I prefer this set of pictures.
Service details: Because I felt a little uncomfortable while getting my makeup done due to pregnancy, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate, allowing me to rest for a while and constantly pouring me hot water to drink.
Set price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the rabbit's review. I originally said that I would refuse the ancient style because it is not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for Dandan's recognition. Your satisfaction can energize us to keep moving forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really awesome, highly recommended for all friends to come!
No matter from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production, everything is impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will match a makeup look suitable for your style. The cosmetics used are also all top-tier brands.
There's no need to mention Teacher Tian Liang, his photography skills are quite professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are also two kittens to accompany and play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing require a six-month advance reservation. Some colleagues have taken photos in Beijing, and after looking at the finished product, we feel it's just so-so.
I specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we feel that this is also a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liang Ge can capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-equipped team.
When the finished product came out, we and the people around us couldn't stop praising it.
Already recommended it to my best friend, and she just saw the film and was equally overjoyed.
I hope that such studios will not be buried, and more people will discover them, creating their own style instead of being stereotyped.
Thank you very much for Zhan Ying and Jing Ling's five-star reviews. Both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and as long as the customers like it, we will do our best to complete it with 200% effort. Grateful for the acquaintance and encounter.
A sweet and considerate assistant, and a lively and cheerful photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting experience and an unforgettable experience. Moreover, the shooting effect was much better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work, and I appreciate everyone 😘😘
Thank you for Xiaoyu's comments. It's fate to know you all. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust in us is as much as thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you all. If there is a chance, come to Qinhuangdao again next time.
How should I pay?
The redelivered meal has already arrived.
No rider received.
Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
A programming newbie who wants to share their personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important matter.
First of all, we need to look at the teaching strength of this institution. If the teaching strength is not strong enough, then this training institution is not very meaningful. Of course, the teaching strength of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Next, before making a choice, investigate the training institution, and it's best to inquire about the students who have graduated from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how good the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question, because you didn't provide a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning has a lot to do with one's personal situation.
For example, factors such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, are all related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated, or a computer science major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, as it is the most efficient and cost-effective method. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the situations I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available online, or you can find a lot of training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can afford a certain amount of learning expenses and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. In this way, learning is not very difficult, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, and there are people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, it is also helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after their studies, which can save a lot of trouble in the job interview process later on.
The above are some of my opinions. Since I don't know your situation, I only gave a general introduction and it's not very detailed. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock, I saw it all on the App.
What does it mean?
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various services such as installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall-mounted boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, installing light fixtures, glass cleaning, professional seam beautification, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently give me likes. Struggling for life is tiring, but we must continue.
Life will not disappoint every hardworking person, if you like it, please follow me, and thank those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, we ourselves bear the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back on the road, but we cannot go back...
Cleaning is a job, but also a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful through service, and service becomes brilliant with dedication.
In housekeeping, although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smiles and thumbs up from the customers, all the tiredness is worth it at that moment, and the effort will eventually be rewarded!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, retain the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping helps you achieve "cleanliness" to the best of my ability, serving your beloved home.
Ensure cleanliness for ten thousand families, establish a monument for household management, provide on-point services, and bring cleanliness to every home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will become dim and dull if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly, and life is the same.
Only by working diligently can we achieve success; by being meticulous, we can create refinement. When it comes to beautiful seams, we are serious.
Give me a chance, I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough to do any job in the current situation!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough persistence, and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than just sitting and complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, and all the beauty begins in the early morning. I hope you start your day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction, and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was a thing, and having it meant happiness; when we grew up, happiness became a goal, and achieving it meant happiness; after maturing, we realized that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it brings happiness.
Be the most genuine and kind version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: good health and a good mood, live beautifully and gracefully until old age!
In every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face things positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it calmly.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face difficulties head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Zhongsha curators join hands to hold the first Saudi contemporary art biennale - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) - The first Saudi Arabian contemporary art biennale - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other places participated in the exhibition.
This Biennale is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, Tian Feiyu, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "crossing the river by feeling the stones," which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society's cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Touching the Stones," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Approaching the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibits, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists have also received much attention, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways to create, such as Xu Bing in "The Endless Stream of Mountains and Rivers in the Behind the Scenes Series" (2014), reconstructing a classic landscape painting with waste materials.
Diriye Biennial Foundation CEO Buckley said that he hopes this year's Biennial can establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction and exchanges.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that during the opening period of the Biennale, a series of lectures will be held, where artists, curators, and creative industry opinion leaders will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) - In order to continuously do a good job in helping the impoverished population find employment and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare positions for promoting rural revitalization, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
A relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 public welfare positions in rural areas, which are used to provide employment for poverty alleviation labor and other rural disadvantaged groups. These positions play an important role in helping impoverished people achieve employment and increase income, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation is jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Affairs, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. It mainly standardizes the scope of target personnel, fund management, job development, and job management for grassroots recruitment of rural public welfare positions.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations clearly state that the setting should be carried out according to the principles of "setting positions according to demand, determining personnel by position, dynamic management, and total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, public notification, employment, pre-job training, and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that each rural public welfare position development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare positions; it also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can the order be cancelled?
I will place the order again.
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the rightists have had their moments of success in history, they were short-lived. The reason for their brevity is that they flourish with just a little sunshine and sweat with just a sip of water; as soon as they achieve a little success, they become greedy for more, and when they encounter setbacks, they have nowhere to turn.
But to be objective, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of defining the criteria of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development and technological advancement, as well as promoting the institutionalization of the political system and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's opinions, I do care about what he says and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that opposing the necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and a mix of good and bad political groups. Moreover, it will create an opportunity for foreign forces to take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political speculation and try to pull chestnuts out of the fire are not right-wingers, but scoundrels.
Let's talk more about the left.
Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If it is said that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left does not have this fortune, because what the left wants is precisely the dregs that the Communist Party has discarded!
5. Recently, I saw some friends arguing with anti-revolutionaries and refuting left-wing extremists, and they were quite serious about it. I think it's not necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or left-wing lunatics, they are all stubborn and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the rebels and the leftists admit it. What's the point?
I tell my friends this way: When the rebels scold you as a "wumao" (50-cent party member), and when the leftists scold you as a rightist dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they either forget their ideals or pursue them, only to become obsessed.
The distance from the ideal gradually increases, and even the young dragon slayer eventually becomes an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraints and freedom. Due to China's inherent historical and cultural genes, China as a whole should lean to the left.
In China, the right-wing advocates for freedom, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes stronger regulation, fairness, and safety.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, the struggle between China and the United States is definitely leaning to the left. It is estimated that this will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, just like it and it's done.
Nothing more to say, Hua Hua is just so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses for "American" companies.
The US is suppressing China's chip industry, demanding that its own companies and allied countries' companies simultaneously block our country's chip industry. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, leading to a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing companies, and thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries worldwide, such as car companies halting production and mobile phone prices rising. Almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to gain autonomy in "chips", more and more technology giants from various countries are starting to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor dominance and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, as well as providing financial support for American domestic technology giants. For example, the US veteran technology giant Intel, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened up chip foundry services to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and may even take away TSMC's "rice bowl."
The reason for such certainty is that Intel, as an old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, possessing a large talent pool and technical reserves. They are bound to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou doesn't care about Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a startling statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou looks down on Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still bears a grudge against the past grievances between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel in the crown of American manufacturing, occupying a dominant position at the global peak and being the world leader in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had always been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chip design, manufacturing, and packaging and testing were all completed by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, such a model is unbearable for some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred by the huge cost of building production lines.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, he thought that since there were specialized design companies, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born in response.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", not engaging in design, and only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, the newly established TSMC was just a small fry in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC only focused on the manufacturing segment of the chip industry, they apparently looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in it.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer manufacturing services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who once looked down on wafer manufacturing services now have to start doing wafer foundry work themselves.
So, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel is entering the foundry business.
Nowadays, TSMC's market value has already surpassed Intel's.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally dares not to be complacent and self-satisfied.
Nowadays, TSMC is already sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel still remains at the 14nm level from 7 years ago.
Catching up is actually not an easy task.
Don't wait anymore.
Ordered at 19:06, it's been 2 hours already 😅
Today, let's take a look at some [weird trending searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon Raising its Head, Hao Liyou price increase, and Huo Lala incident. The public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then the [index declines] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small peak will appear again.
They look almost identical to the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event, presenting a "solitary peak", "serrated", and "cliff-like" appearance.
【Solitary Peak】refers to artificially heating up, quickly rushing to the top of the hot search list, and attracting public attention; 【Sawtooth】refers to periodic heating up, ensuring that the topic occupies the hot search list; 【Cliff】refers to collective withdrawal, the hot search has played its "function", received new tasks, and rushed to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, with no difference in time. This must be a unified batch of water army receiving tasks and launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of the black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularizing science, which ones provoke and create momentum, which ones divert attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, and which ones involve decision-making. The black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for refined operations, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. When we put aside positions, emotions, and all subjective factors, and only focus on objective data, even negative public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we leave traces behind. Let's dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries report first cases of Omicron variant infection - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - According to reports from Xinhua's foreign correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omicron variant infections on the 10th.
According to Mauritius Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the virus on November 30 after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of these two infected persons have turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first 3 cases of Omicron variant infection.
These three people are all students who returned from traveling abroad at the beginning of this month. Since they all have mild symptoms, they have not been hospitalized for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the government of Seychelles continues to strengthen its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter the country by plane will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
On the 10th, the Ministry of Health of Seychelles announced that it will start administering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country has detected its first three cases of Omicron variant infection.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing on 12 COVID-positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and identified these 3 infection cases.

Damei 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 South Ring Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for basic decoration.
Upon arriving at the store, a series of scams began.
This is my first time coming to the store just to show them my floor plan. They didn't actually go to measure the house, but they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house can be done for 70,000. They roughly showed me their materials, but I don't know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that as long as you go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay this money, you can never get it back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that as long as I paid the deposit today, they could give me a certain discount.
This is a big pitfall, and I am a living example of being deceived. In a moment of impulsive thinking, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
The quote he gave me has many issues: 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovation, nor does it include any doors and cabinets for the bathroom, and these three are the main costs of basic decoration.
Apart from these, the service fees they charge are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company, they didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and just let me sign the contract.
When I went to ask for a refund, they appeared very experienced and had a dedicated small team to deal with you.
No matter what, they will bite the customer's issue to death and they are completely blameless.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and there are many details, I don't want to say one by one, all are tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house renovated by them is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
What a rip-off, they used to be the leading deceptive dragon head decoration, now they changed to Damei, it seems like they went bankrupt and changed to something else.
So everyone, don't choose such a pitfall decoration company.
In the future, everyone should use Baidu more to check and consult about these things when making choices, because renovation is not a small expense.
To ask questions to the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the release of various forms of merchant reviews, for details please see the merchant inclusion statement.
Dianping's Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Damei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. To find a decoration company, just go to Dianping.
So scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there really no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, then don't cancel this conversation. If I don't receive a refund in 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it can be canceled in less than 15 minutes.
The saliva chicken should be cooked, but I received raw meat, which is inedible.
Starry sky appointment | The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) - Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the night on that day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers have periodic comets as their parent bodies, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng said that just like a New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the Quadrantids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, they are called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteors have a relatively slow speed, rich colors, and many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and photography by astronomy beginners.
Tianjin amateur astronomer Yang Jing captured the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a peak ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observation conditions, when the radiant point is directly overhead) of 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
Last year, the "colorful" Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by moonlight, and the spectacular level will be slightly discounted.
On the 14th, it is the 11th day of the eleventh month in the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and at this time, the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the second half of the night, but be sure to keep warm and protect against the cold.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place in the suburbs or countryside with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing the northeast direction. Then, patiently wait until the moon sets, and you can observe with the naked eye.
What needs to be noted is that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so there is no need to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower during observation.
Friends who like photography and want to capture stunning 'meteor shower shots' should choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, a tripod, spare battery, and shutter release cable are also essential.
Xiulipeng reminds to say.
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
Based on my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to the LCD TV, and the main differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning are as follows:
Firstly, laser TVs are more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the widespread market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TVs are inherently designed for large screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs has been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of TVs with 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason for such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TVs in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the natural imaging process of objects, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The China Electronics Standardization Institute's Saixi Laboratory and ophthalmology experts from Beijing Union Hospital conducted a strict comparative test of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the population, obtaining 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection features, and even have certain improvement effects in specific aspects.
In the context of increasing attention to vision health, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, the current market price of laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan. As the size and light source are upgraded, the price gradually increases.
Why is the laser TV so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TVs and projectors.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is much shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, allowing for a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. The required space is small, and the main unit is compact, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can achieve over 2000 lumens.
In addition, the lower heat generation reduces the wear and tear on the equipment, resulting in a longer service life for the television.
In addition to this, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It's not a false demand, but rather a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not suitable for audio and video enthusiasts. If you want to balance a large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can give it a try. Everything has its pros and cons, and you can make your own judgment after weighing them. Just be careful not to be swayed by one-sided opinions.
In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle short-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which do not conform to the optimal optical design.
In order to block some ambient light, using a microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch one can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I particularly hate it when projector manufacturers use the selling point that diffuse reflection is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse the light to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. If you really want to argue, LCD TVs are also diffuse "direct light." When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, an image cannot be formed at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is exactly overlooked, and a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Preferred Quality Store currently has no branches.
After adding WeChat to make an appointment, the young lady sent me the available time slots, and her response was quite prompt.
Before going, I looked at the shooting works in the store, most of which were outdoor wedding dresses. They were beautifully shot and involved a wide variety of shooting styles.
After arriving on the day, I briefly communicated my thoughts with the young lady, and she patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes in the styles I was struggling with. Finally, we decided to start with makeup and styling. Before the photographer started shooting, they would arrange some props, guide the poses, and pay great attention to every detail.
But maybe because there was no communication with me about the specific shooting ideas, the result is not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking🙊🙊.
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the pictures, discuss the post-production style, and seems quite attentive.
The repaired film will take about half a month, just wait for the effect~
Won the photography category's free meal event for the second time ~ You can choose one piece of clothing from most of the items in the venue to shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is a younger brother born after 1995, who feels a bit inexperienced. I hope he can give more advice on guiding customers' actions in the future. He is quite talkative, and the shooting process was quite enjoyable.
Wen She Vision Aesthetics Photography Gallery Preferred Quality Store Reply
Made it to the homepage, come and take a look at Queenie too~
Upon arriving at the store, I filled in my name and phone number, then chose the outfits, including wedding dresses. I tried on three or four outfits and they were quite patient. After choosing, it took a long time for the makeup, but the service attitude was good. During the photoshoot, they taught me how to pose, but the photos made my face look big. They said the retouching would take half a month, but it was sent in three or four days. It didn't seem to have much difference from the original photo.
【Environment】Overall, it's not bad.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup locations, and inside is the photography studio.
[Service] is very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to propose a reshoot.
[Experience] The styling might have gone a bit too far, as the original double eyelids were taped into triple eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for those who don't draw their eyebrows daily.
The photo was given about ten days ago, but the Photoshop effect is not very satisfactory. The double eyelid stickers still look very obvious.
Because I was not sure about the style, I tried two sets. After going back and forth, I finally chose the black dress. The young lady said this set is more of an Audrey Hepburn vintage style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup and hair. The hairstylist and makeup artist sisters were super patient in helping me, and the final result was very satisfying.
After finishing my makeup and hair, I started taking photos. The photographer guided me on how to pose throughout the whole process, and it was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorite ones for fine-tuning. The guy said they would be ready within 15 days, and in the end, I was very satisfied with the results.
It's been 3 days without a reply... Due to your system's inability to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that every time I make a payment, I use the same credit card.
I have to pay shipping fees every time now.
Can you waive the fee first and charge me the monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyusan is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Insurance Brokerage Institution Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, initiators with no major violations in the past three years, a minimum limit of RMB 50 million is required to establish, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, they require having strong capabilities, obtaining approval from the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and having shareholders with a good work style. As for the small umbrella insurance of insurance brokerage companies, policyholders do not need to doubt whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not, as not all insurance companies can meet these three thresholds.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, where many companies' star critical illness insurance products are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mario No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. Both the claim and underwriting parties are Hetai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyusan Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products have a higher cost-performance ratio because they save on the operating costs of physical outlets and the salaries of sales staff. Moreover, the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, which can reduce the payment pressure on policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still pretty good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of professional competence of salespersons: This point is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires a high level of professionalism. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or suitable. This can easily lead to many hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being denied compensation.
I have personally worked in insurance telemarketing at "Tencent WeBao" (like Xiaoyusan, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible in telling everyone.
The insurance on the internet is real and reliable, but the unreliable part is the people. There are no professional practitioners in the internet channels, and there are many sales misguidances.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance comes with a free mobile phone, and you can get 60,000 yuan of critical illness coverage for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important points and do not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the following months require normal charges, ranging from tens to 200 yuan. Many customers are unclear about what they have bought after being charged for one or two years.
Thought you could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would compensate 6 million (pies falling from the sky).
Free mobile phones are given to special policy numbers ending in 6666, 8888, etc. Moreover, if the winning text message is sent out and you don't redeem it, no one will remind you.
(For the insured, this is another pitfall) Getting a free 60,000 yuan critical illness coverage is short-term. If you only rely on this and have no other commercial insurance, in case a critical illness really occurs, what can 60,000 yuan do? It can't solve the problem, and your future life will be exposed.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
So, in summary, there is no problem with the platform or the product. The issue lies in the professionalism and work ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the questioner should consider comprehensively and cautiously. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products have a better cost-performance ratio than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers with offline insurance products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me.
I am Mingya, an insurance broker with over 3 years of experience in corporate management training. I have served nearly a thousand corporate clients and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking out insurance, I will start from the client's needs and tailor insurance products for them. During the insurance process, I will compare three companies for the client and strive for the best underwriting results. After taking out insurance, I will help clients with policy organization and policy custody, ensuring they can have peace of mind.
Grow together with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business where the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign either, and all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although purchasing insurance online does not have much of a "ceremonial feel" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we purchase insurance, should we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later?
How can I contact the food delivery staff?
It's already almost 3 o'clock.
Does that mean I should be given compensation?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider just left it at the door and then the person left.
Still sent wrong
Your rider has already picked up my takeaway at #NUMBER#, but it still shows as waiting until now.
The rider received my takeaway at 19:25, but still refused to set off.
After I finish buying, do you want any other takeout?
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Still need to wait?
I am going to deliver the order.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

You can just make up for the discount code.
No problem, remember there is no need to arrange for redelivery, I have already made another purchase and do not want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such scoundrels.
If we disregard political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Since you started sending me Facebook friend requests, followed by posting sarcastic posts, and even trying to publish the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have adopted an unresponsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a rate of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, body, fertility, and comments about "planting strawberries" in bed and whether to insert or not. I... let it go.
How would I know that later on, I would receive messages from several friends about a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment elements uploaded on your Facebook friend's account.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I uploaded the news of my calling the police, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your social status, in our society, mutual respect between genders is required.
Yes, you can continue with this sarcastic, obscure, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it is not the picture you made or continue to make all kinds of aggressive remarks.
That's right, I can't and don't have the ability to stop you guys.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need your comments and judgments.
I don't even think there would be any girl who would be willing to let others humiliate her so much just to become famous.
A friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said it's good, but you won't believe it.
I don't think there is any girl who can say she is fine after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics, or business, only those who lack even basic morals would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people.
I have cut out some comments for everyone to judge.
The post you made yourself should prevent anyone from impersonating you, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
A knowing smile
Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held, discussing topics revolving around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, despite the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam has grown, focusing on solving major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms, and to undertake the task of developing these national digital platforms as their national mission.
On the forum, leaders from various departments and national agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals engaged in the research, development, application, and transfer of digital technologies, shared their breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology companies, jointly promoting the country's digital transformation, and economic recovery after the pandemic.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, serving the whole population, and therefore requires the participation of all people.
The people and enterprises are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and enterprises.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that the digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, and it requires internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term, and decisive factors, while external forces are important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and promote green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the protection and promotion of the establishment of databases related to national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and other aspects, and promote the digital transformation in the fields of banking, taxation, land management and development databases, as well as logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country increasingly prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng demands that governments at all levels, institutions, and enterprises increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and initiative.
During the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng attended the 2021 "Made in Vietnam" Outstanding Digital Product Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Exhibition.
I have reported and attached pictures, but there is no reply.
What's so great about it? It's not that impressive.
It is saliva chicken, raw meat.
There is no way to eat.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not old?
This sentence means "not acceptable" or "not allowed" in English.
I placed an order early in the morning.
It is said that it will be delivered at around 7 o'clock.
Why remake it?
This is too outrageous.

Address: No. 555 Gaotie North First Road, view map
The home appliances here are quite complete, with numerous brands and all well-known brands.
During the Double Twelve event, I went to the "Hansdun" water purifier store to check out water purifiers. The store was having a promotion, and the prices were relatively favorable.
Juran Home has a total of 11 floors, from -2 to 9. The first and second basement floors are for parking, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are really not that great, with only a few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the food in the restaurants is just average.
This elevator is also speechless, just like having a serious illness, going back and forth between the negative second and negative first floors, constantly pressing this floor, going down to the first floor from the safety passage, also speechless, directly leading to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, and the safety passage cannot be exited!

The main stream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of green integrated service areas on the water - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) - The Fuling Water Green Integrated Service Area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green integrated service area officially operating in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, following the inauguration of the Luzhou Water Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province on the 8th.
So far, the waterborne green integrated service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 waterborne green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been widely recognized by the crew members and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the green integrated service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, and the reception of pollutants from ships and the shipping service capacity on the Yangtze River have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the waterborne green integrated service area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for the majority of ships and crew members, helping them solve the "urgent, difficult, and worrying" problems.
The two green integrated service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been built and put into operation, integrate living services, production services, and government services, with the theme of green environmental protection and the characteristics of ship maintenance and emergency rescue services. They enable ships in the port to "dock once and receive multiple services," making the work of crew members who sail on the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and their lives more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. January 17, 2022, Duowei, a pro-China media, reports: The latest news on China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending important signals to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform," on January 9, a satellite discovered the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" has deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson," the U.S. aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean include the "Abraham Lincoln" (USS Abraham Lincoln), which set sail from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Shamplin Lake" missile cruiser, the "Stokdal" missile destroyer, and so on.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The most powerful weapon, rarely visiting Guam.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US Navy's CMV-22B transport aircraft.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a report by the US Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada," carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. Analysts say this sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the India-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea islands.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada" to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrating the U.S.'s capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually called "Boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thundering Submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the "Thundering Submarine" the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad, which also includes land-based ballistic missiles in the United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, with a market value evaporating by 251 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responded that they are "facing unprecedented competition." What is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its main revenue coming from advertisements. Nowadays, a profitable advertising company has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., regardless of their functional positioning, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many apps connecting to Meta's ads, and monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
Firstly, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow the App to access their information. The normal reaction of most people would definitely be not to allow it.
If Google takes another stab at it, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the China factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has weakened (it is uncertain how significant this factor is, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in overseas business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and there are also several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, and Meta is an indispensable advertising channel. Most of the money spent goes to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made quite a bit of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
Domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also quite good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies spending massively overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only values revenue, but more importantly, it looks at how future expectations are.
It is quite obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "Metaverse."
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story may not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
So, the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
Don't be fooled by Facebook's current prosperity, with annual revenues of 100 to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook now has a strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it doesn't have a good and secure moat.
Although his several social media apps have relatively high daily active users and are mainstream social media platforms, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., they do not have much confidence in the face of TikTok's rapid development, and it only takes a blink of an eye for them to be subverted.
The concept of creating a metaverse, which is desirable but unattainable, has no hope of success in the short term, making Facebook very dangerous. This is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg has changed the company's name and is constantly looking for new tracks. However, I think his choice of track is wrong and is a dead end. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
