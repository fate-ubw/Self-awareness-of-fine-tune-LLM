The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a major customer of #PRS_ORG# and therefore it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what I should include in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to get a credit?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Just take a quick look, help out for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be enough of a child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 occupies themselves for a short time and it's OK for them, then that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether that is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany them for hours while they fall asleep.
From a purely legal standpoint, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's also where the statement from the psychologist comes from.
Because if something were to actually happen, like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would indeed be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, up to your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but I just can't remember the title at all - maybe someone here knows it...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide, document it, and post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and the patients ultimately have to face their fear in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death.
This confrontation with fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is roughly the plot, and I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this plot or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that might take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wood splinter under the thumbnail (outer side) along the entire length.
Have tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

What am I supposed to do with this number then?
Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to accelerate booster vaccination
Ever-increasing Omicron cases worry politics and science in the United Kingdom.
By New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson aims to progress even faster with the COVID-19 booster vaccinations than previously targeted, in light of rapidly increasing Omicron cases.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens.
So far, the target date has been set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Get your booster now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron cases were registered in the United Kingdom, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
Today the invitation for a conversation came via email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background from, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I just don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them are leaving.
Only the one that I bought today does not work.
Obviously, the chair had a non-apparent defect at the time of sale.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has already been working for about ca.
Haven't for 14 days anymore.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for it.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write here a bit more detailed about domestic violence.
I just need to write something off my chest.
I (21) frequently come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims do not accept help or think we could not help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier through this.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How good is the series based on "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least you could rely on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, looking back on the cup defeat in early October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
However, after the game, it did not subside - but rather increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was even more disappointing than the mere result was the manner of the performance.
As an example, let's mention a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was only 13 percent, with 4 successful shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, we simply weren't focused enough and didn't implement what we had practiced."
Namely, to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim, his counterpart, reacted quite differently: "Winning a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I have ever coached," Gleim praised further.
During the game, even the top performers in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and managed to close the gap to eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left for brooding.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm), the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have obtained legal information again and have therefore contacted you again.
We originally contacted you already half a year ago.
Always looking like he just stepped out of a bandbox: Max Raabe turns 59.
He is able to excite his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official order" to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists want to make up for their dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has enjoyed singing a lot since his teenage years.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He has managed to move it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe has become an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and thus we could check beforehand whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but cannot flip through.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and the Left Party wants to appoint an expert commission to determine how to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, however, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent control until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
"If the rental market still does not relax, 'we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps'," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I realized that I forgot the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I will redeem it independently with the new order.
Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept across the USA.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night leading into Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred fatalities.
The storms leave a path of destruction about 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had swept through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with the official numbers increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that display case #NAME# is sold out.
That is very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the product range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
By when will you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket that is in the shopping cart now and have it delivered to Germany?
I had returned an item via the contact form or submitted a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated.
With this, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He switched to a company that he had badmouthed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You are allowed to do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure "Über den Greifenpass" for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We play The Dark Eye 5.
The big arc is created, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out, and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumble over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There, the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the heroes and luring them into an ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, trading, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a hollow path and flank the carriage with three on each side armed with bows, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two possible solutions.
1. The heroes all become unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you consider Deus ex Machina for Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back.
Can you then send the return labels, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#?

Suddenly, the crack was there.
I just sat on it.
Here, the lower part, i.e. the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so with this post I want to vent a little.
First of all, today the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the start accident, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it seems that for legal reasons F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge about the rules in F1 among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this opportunity exists for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such elementary rules if one is commenting on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first guessing game about what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules; both simply have constant uncertainties regarding the topic of rules.
In general, I don't like the contrived comment style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better than that.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD."
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest to the comment, as he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky; in the final lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also run fewer ads during training sessions than Sky, and they do so as free-to-air channels.
One must indeed praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, apart from the commercials, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
At any rate, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in hearing your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be shipped on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lift.
This series is offered by us in 3 different versions.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several diffusers.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model of fan pump, but it is also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here, one could mention a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to a diffuser or similar using a 4/6 mm air hose...and then you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be level with or higher than the water level and should be mounted externally.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to flow backwards once, that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, packages are packed daily and are also picked up daily from here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take some precautions so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer once.
It would be like this, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry... of course, Corona does not stop here either.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, as this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we say at the moment... they have a damn hard time.
This also varies greatly by region.
Do not be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and host into space.
The daughter of the first US-American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
On Saturday, they were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliantly blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
"She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh."
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would most like to return to space immediately, said the host.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object slowed down and landed again with the help of large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space excursion by Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently shine in one color or cycle through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminous stone retains a light color for about one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light proves itself year-round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, their light looks particularly good - only a shorter duration of illumination can be expected as soon as the days get shorter.
In winter, please just make sure that no snow impairs the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a common NiMH battery in the Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if needed.
You can obtain a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus further extend the usage time of your decorative light.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite exciting in itself, and I also don't mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to study up to a doctorate and would do so.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc), you keep hearing about great job opportunities and that the profession is in high demand, on the other hand, you keep hearing about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
So I would really be interested:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
What did you study / What training did you do?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and considering possibly dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences with that, feel free to write them down as well :)
Extra stress before holiday and holiday weekend
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, is there a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that it is also available before holidays and bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend coming up.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
So many emails that absolutely had to go out before Ascension Day, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also extremely annoyed.
What is the purpose of this self-flagellation because of holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we're not allowed to properly enjoy them?!
The stress, mind you, did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independently like that.
My simple question is: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is that our Reformed Protestant way?
Or do you know that in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she doesn't have any gifts yet.
"The nice thing is, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer to Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the festival by baking cookies and doing crafts with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I finally have to get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and the regeneration of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping can be attributed exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no additional vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR Handicraft Model Old Building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in operation in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME issue 11/1968, used with signs of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn Society commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive, AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves afterwards on the territory of the later GDR (German Democratic Republic).
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Dessau railway repair workshop, it was determined that all six locomotives were worthy of refurbishment.
As the progressive electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare part donors.
In the process, the E 04, E 44, and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were initially given priority for construction.
Only when it became apparent with the E 94 that the number of reconditioning could not be increased any further, the E 95 moved into the focus of reconditioning.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mainly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control system of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it often happened that the circuit breaker got stuck during switching operations.
Then the assistant, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to release the contactors with a hammer and wooden wedge while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to month-long failures of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at that time, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the minor types, which led to the E 95 being taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to staff electric locomotives with only one person, which would have caused a problem in train operations due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, the last one to follow was the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main train station in Halle.
It took some time before the people in charge at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle exhibition in RAW Dessau.
Since then, she has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is taken care of in a museum setting.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, during which the transformers were checked and five traction motors were operational.
The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching secondary lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handicraft model H0 in original packaging, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary as a DIY job, dusty, with signs of play, basement smell!!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and signs of storage.
Yes, it's the F-parts.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is supported by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot assemble the bed.
The center beam is supported by two feet, but unfortunately, these have been produced with defects.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I will get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, those are the correct ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose.
At my place, they are not flat.
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The criminal police of Fürstenfeldbruck have taken over the further investigations.
But that arrives much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn."
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously commented publicly on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Şahin announced.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media claiming that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
"Indeed, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn."
For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Anxiety is difficult to combat with facts; sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"Currently, I am not legally allowed to receive the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the administration of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for about 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The utility company Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers, both male and female, from the THW (Technical Relief Agency) provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
"We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were initially only able to put some lines back into operation on a temporary basis, he explained.
According to company information, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at around 7:15 pm has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work would be necessary.
In parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm onwards.
Since 11:15 pm, even those who were last affected by the outage have had electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
The authorities, after setting up emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, had also called for neighborhood assistance.
"What is important now is that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and report to the local fire stations when help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical devices or relied on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy those from you and pay in Euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# bedspread in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I cannot mount the subframe on the table top, though.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received 155cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot slide them together and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins combined event
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to admit defeat to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a significant lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard about problems more often.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
Chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between as well!
To ensure an even and clean application of paint, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model with a new color for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlap of the color layers ensures a uniform surface later on.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
As a result, surfaces appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are applied at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there may be unsightly metal streaks when they mix with regular colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
The models achieve a true-to-original appearance through the decals or transfer pictures.
From emblems on airplanes and ship names to decorative strips and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An airplane cockpit can be more easily covered with adhesive before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are time, patience, and a steady hand when applying the adhesive.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them for yourself.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisten their backside briefly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the dampness.
Then you slide the image just a small distance from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper sideways.
Caution: Always check first if the image is positioned correctly before you completely slide it off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle, or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Caution: not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look at something else, I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in again, reload the book and find the spot up to where I have read.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you once before.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at my place in 3 separate packages.
Ok, thank you very much anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Can I get that back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, but now, when it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance, they suddenly refuse to cooperate.
One after the other:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received the approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were in no way limited (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed through the private health insurance (PKV).
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle these with the private health insurance.
We applied again for the cost coverage at the private health insurance and were granted 3 more attempts again.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive ones with the private health insurance), we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and received the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire for a child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts should be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the commitments that with a birth the further attempts are forfeited?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Many thanks in advance for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
All right.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was initiated, and now you're telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't help it if the dresser arrives completely disturbed at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It clearly states that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore now.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
A desk chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of that, a 24-month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and be able to make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional stools available for purchase, but unfortunately, we cannot find them at your place.
Can you help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly constitutes a low-budget film.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what do you maybe not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended once again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
With kind regards
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Protestant News Service (epd).
The EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively turn against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development simultaneously weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot assert herself when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border."
Furthermore, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Repeated attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Saturday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting measures and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'll check that.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you again.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
The Europa-Park, namesake for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white that day through the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park, it once again became clear how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 World Champion.
Max Verstappen has done it.
The Dutchman wins his first World Championship title in his seventh year in Formula 1 with Red Bull.
His way to the summit of the royal class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen loses the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him angrily at a gas station on the return journey.
His mother Sophie Kumpen picks up the teenager in the car following behind.
2014, England: The Red Bull junior team gets promising young talent in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old thus follows in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
At that time, he initially continues to compete in the European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: At the age of 17 years and 166 days, Verstappen starts as the youngest pilot in history in a Grand Prix.

Back then, I already had a huge problem with them when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home."
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord," author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also served as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for the return of an item yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my inquiry has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not everyone from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I cannot chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package would like to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
With kind regards

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like when someone from the AfD says they have nothing against foreigners.
They both will not admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just completely leave it alone.
Well, then you're about as credible as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spouting nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously, just like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass virtually distortion-free and without color errors up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification specifications.
These specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, we kindly ask you to observe the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses - light reflections occur.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When adhering to the optimal usage conditions - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instruction manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the Krembz municipality, women choose the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced quite a few curious situations during the sale of fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even driven home without his partner because the two could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces for this purpose.
In the process, the 56-year-old has already experienced quite a few curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny, he says.
And what about the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a discussion here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names for this reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly, except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, at the other DLAN module, which emits the Wi-Fi, the full 500 no longer arrive, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less arrives (i.e., using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet with the new fiber optic connection now being even slower on the first floor than before (approximately 45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house now.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch the checking account
Who would have thought that there would finally be peace with the checking accounts is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to have their past fee increases confirmed by their customers using all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax exemption and even quartered it for the overnight money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously lowered the limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, popular among cost-conscious customers, has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still an ongoing legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won their case against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now there is already a discussion in the banks about whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen as the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter."
For her, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, Aniston says, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: just ONE SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of both female and male fans nevertheless fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she simply has bad luck with happiness - and is still searching for true love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up.
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the barrier, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport premier class.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and made it onto the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich achieves 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The goal of the bobsleigh pilot is to reach the record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes.
"I did the math, I would have to achieve nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he fended off the attack from Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he moved from rank three to one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he achieved a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier finished third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also secured his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who competes for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously finishing in second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte secured her third seasonal victory in the two-woman bobsleigh on her home track.
After finishing only fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi during the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she achieved her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing, "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not entirely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently discounted :)
Why will the shipping only start on March 16th?
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is that a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day left, only this week left, only until XY...
Hello dear amazing girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write down and maybe some others feel the same way...
I am 24, have complex PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
On top of that, he has a cold and we currently see each other less (1-2 times a week), which really affects me with my needs for affection and love.
My fur baby just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and the latter is away for a month.
Now we also have housework coming our way, which of course we will divide among ourselves.
But cooking by myself is currently a lot of work for me...
My PTSD condition is currently quite well managed, I am halfway well treated and getting by.
Not good, but I'm getting by and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I cannot even put it into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that this also has partly to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening in any case, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, but unfortunately the entire color is different, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: Back in school, I noticed that many religious education teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, that was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
What is your opinion on that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? Feel free to write in English, I understand that well too.
That is already very long, then I would refrain from it.
Is good, thank you.
I expect a response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support, #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it more closely anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's burial site.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
In case that means something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has slept on their stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one might think.
Make sure everything around is right, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute-by-minute monitoring.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from its stomach?
Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
From that, you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up too, and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Additionally, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already purchased many items.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR then?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I kindly ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station have become absolutely terrible by now.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also going on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a walking advertising column."
What is one now?
A generic advertising channel that tries to sell its cheap merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make money at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can one find all of that good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I request a callback, as my delivered wooden table was delivered damaged.
Body fracture due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling - My little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even when they are not feeling so well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is exclusively suitable as a heat pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odors, mold or burn marks, and dispose of it immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it!
Afterwards, place the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the initial heatings, slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications.
Definitely follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow for the heating of grain products.
After placing the heated inner cushion back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in cases of acute and chronic inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises, and open wounds, as well as in individuals with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as during pregnancy, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose cores are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of reach for children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be regularly monitored during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the bottom of the table.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well even under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would also be sufficient for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start anymore despite the plugged-in power adapter.
After that, I removed the battery, but still nothing happens here.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains power?
Is something else broken there?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat surface is.....
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
A 20-liter capacity can easily accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday items, thanks to practical access points, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: Firstly, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
In the process, there is a metal locking hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar; if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
The clasp and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be closed reliably without engaging the hook.
The second feature fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: especially when you are not only carrying your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more on that below) and thus store both separately without any problems - and access them independently through the two side openings.
In this way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
Contact initiated by the forwarding company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table announced.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, and with none of them have I gotten further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Can it be estimated when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help.
Wishing you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher for me, I will place a larger order immediately, but after all, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not have anticipated and therefore could not redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, am the one who suffers the damage and I do not accept that.

Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the notches improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of every car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers apparently have the same idea!
You must surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly "works" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style through fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock!
This disables one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the promoter turns to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, followed by the final scoring.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I will use the shipping method "merchandise shipment" (games wrapped in foil) for dimensions up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, mostly DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games wrapped in foil, surrounded by fleece and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also ship the item in a box within a box for an additional charge of 2 Euros, ensuring that there will be no pressure marks 100%.
"Why children are not tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
TW: psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now raising serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people nowadays think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States discuss the elimination of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag."
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated individuals is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal on this matter to the Health Ministers' Conference as early as next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back.
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is possible.
I have updated the account information.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most often, this involves hearing noises/voices, less frequently seeing images, and very rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are surgeries that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia methods, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine does indeed describe awareness correctly, however, by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.
Misread their comment.
The chair is broken, though.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
There we also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Once again the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarding company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An Old Man Gets Older."
The moving diary of a slow farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common types are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not recorded.
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a penalty shootout with a 4:2 victory.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had received many great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and tender as butter!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've acquired a taste for it and would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start making a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me otherwise?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens now?
What about the books, or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good anymore, but I can manage that.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 01/18 that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check there.
Where you can still get Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas holidays as the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
As mentioned earlier, with the POWER LEVEL knob, you can even mobilize a power reserve when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, allowing you to jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
Those who treat themselves to an additional VFS5 footswitch can also conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
But I had seen it like that with others.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs before?
If it doesn't work, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended to be part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
In the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement, progress is emerging according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had resumed after a break of almost one week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence rate above the 1000 mark on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1,025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in hospitals with intensive care.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I not need to click/enter/fill out anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping costs myself, please.
In my opinion, an 8 euro return fee is outrageous.
It is time for change.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What's the purpose of the post here?
When looking at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one thing can be determined: it is non-existent.
We have entered a winter hibernation and have extended the summer slump for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this is probably simply due to the dissatisfaction with how some things have happened here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, it has increasingly become apparent that many people here are genuinely still interested in the MBundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked, who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in recent days and, simply put, found a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
For this purpose, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing arrangements need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not bad, that's what we have the Discord for in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for this purpose and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversized, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pick-up - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have to obtain these or decide to return them?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I really like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, and currently probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
In response to the question of whether I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And indeed, I used to think that by being a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that ultimately I was also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that discontent arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you quickly get put in a corner and conflicts arise without you even trying to provoke them.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed either.
Can an alternative pick-up date please be assigned to me?
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I can be found continuously again.
Lahnsteiner Weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant notification of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this matter," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they permanently expect increasing deployments: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems began.
I cannot open the book.
I followed their recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did NOT work.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, it is like that.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were determined in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

First of all, thank you for facing this whole issue here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, meaning we were also weapon carriers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into more detail about that!
I always find the question about right and left to be very oversimplified.
Basically, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that, of course, uniforms and weapons carriers, in particular, magically attract people to the right of conservative. It should also be clear that these people naturally have difficulty dealing with lived reality, because, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotype gay, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive, but rather completely normal men and women who you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you). And I can and must rely on these people, because in an emergency they will save your life or risk theirs for you.
But even these marginalized groups, as strange as it may sound, represent a conservative attitude in my experience, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less addressed by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks it has to please them. What they really want is just to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will find extreme right-wing people there as well. However, the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinions there or even openly forge any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that like-minded people with right-wing views meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply involved internationally, and in my opinion, that's a good thing, because we absolutely cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available for delivery.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket in black for #NUMBER# Euros to Germany, or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Tidier through child?
Hello, there is something (w32) that has been bothering me for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little free time), but for my entire life, I have been more or less unsuccessful in keeping my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and now and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it is actually never the case that "someone could spontaneously come to visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) not any better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly household chores simply lose out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for quite some time.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you more motivation or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality pre-shaped anatomical cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bends).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled in order to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the crotch ensure a close-fitting, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the back zipper, thereby improving comfort, especially when bending down and when mounting and putting on equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and on the back, guarantees increased flexibility for movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head hood).
Soft zone in the collar improves the seal with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle Velcro fastener, which does not stick to the lamination or the seams.
Double cuffs with zippers on the wrists and ankles connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (coverall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush glued with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater load capacity
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wristband computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in the field of software development and have now been fully trained for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for quite some time.
The problem: I have a self-uncertain (or fearfully avoidant) personality disorder (FAPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told several times that I seem unapproachable (although I believe that has already improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't really want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know, however, if the actual work routine is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("screwed up the simplest things again") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really slow" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But you have already received the sofa back, haven't you?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup.
What do they mean by returning, please!
When I download a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message that your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems there?
I was in a chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into individual protein components (amino acids) and, in turn, builds up its own body proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather regeneration in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise cause disturbances in the breeding process.
After this course-like administration of NEKTON-Bio, one should return to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g of NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One leveled measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So, a motion has been submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is quite clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive then?
Yes, I believe that, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
As the police press alert currently reports (2:03 pm), a car has entered oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand.
Alright, then thank you very much again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something different and also worked in a field there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was too boring for me, so I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now reached the third "I am googling other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
At the times before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still change course.
But right now I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation time, but there's still a ton of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but back then my weekend was my weekend and my time off was my time off.
I had the day off then.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also seems to be going well, as far as feedback and such is concerned.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have it like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts - or if I should go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and although I found the work somehow boring, I was paid appropriately and worked together in a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if in a year I will not have ended up in the same place as now and be dissatisfied.
You notice, everything is somehow confusing, but maybe you, as outsiders, have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I won't be making decisions emotionally right now, as it probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances simply bubble out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Naturally, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amp primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and, based on this finding, developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough for a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras, such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2, still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damages amounting to millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a one-meter-thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new land spits with a total size of about 50 hectares were formed by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and additional areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
All the more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas holidays with the tradition of gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom today is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have secretly thrown gold into the window of three women in one night, in order to spare them a further life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular custom in Germany emerged of filling the boots, especially those of children, with gifts.
Protestants took issue with this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and people as "veneration of saints."
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not view such detailed questions so strictly anymore, only very few are still annoyed that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's tradition with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, you can find everything your heart desires, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a cheerful confusion about the question of who actually brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been attributed over time.
For example, this includes his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas celebration.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has brought some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Many thanks with love.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by the police on Saturday.
The police announced that callers had reported a man who allegedly entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers shortly after.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
In the area around Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Illumination duration max. 10 hours.
The sturdy plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, they are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully from within.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in as many as six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither power supply nor batteries.
Place the "luminous stone" in any spot that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
Two included ground spikes ensure a secure hold when needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly conceals "Smart Stone" within its interior, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At the onset of twilight, "Smart Stone" automatically starts to glow; you can choose the color yourself: In addition to daylight white, you have a choice of six attractive light colors.
The device will also automatically turn off once the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning the next day.
I have already done that several times, it doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order anymore out of principle.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year of Reddit this is actually my first post.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stop doing that again, because due to chronic illnesses I already have to take enough medications that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, I suddenly got pimples from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this happening again this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without frills, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me very seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yeah, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis prepubertally, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular lichen and the acne issue.
I have also tried all sorts of diets due to chronic illness and ended up sticking with a low sugar, milk, and meat mixed diet because nothing else really worked well.
It could also be that there is simply a hormonal issue, but when you have problems everywhere like I do, you don't really want to look for what else might be going wrong.
I had already given everything to her colleague in a seminar or similar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was replied to my concern.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
But is it generally available in large?
Since it is available in large and black.

In the name of the people: Laypeople make judgments with
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear a robe: lay judges, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
In a conversation with the "Public", two of them report from their time at the Bad Kreuznach Regional Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Regional Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order number #NUMBER# again to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means of storing these for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were our own.
I would be happy to, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I would like one in gray now.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pickup and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
The 110-kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is set to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue order number #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is now?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass dresser and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
That means the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thanks for the message
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry with #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Plan lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues and fellow workers,
I have been in the teaching internship since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I am currently still having major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped in terms of technology, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
In school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and for me, each lesson actually stands on its own.
In principle, the methods also keep repeating themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need that time for lesson preparations, etc.).
In planning, I actually always start with the learning objective (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence also the worksheets.
Maybe an geography teacher can show me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible first.
The trade fears for the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and laments declines in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
In businesses dealing with non-daily necessities, there are declines in sales to complain about, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
According to this, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only going well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G while shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and require a high level of personnel deployment.
He demanded that the ribbon control must be allowed nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the received wristband.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the revenues were at about 90 percent.
"These numbers will certainly drop now, right in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche."
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approvals are being obtained for the centers.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all stores undisturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on the film set and in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery) there.
User memory: The memory can store up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is restored when switching on again - very practical for studio work, for example when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, resulting from the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display indicators (the left battery in the upper display, the right one in the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously power the spotlight using the supplied power adapter.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locking devices on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way, you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessian team, who had recently suffered two consecutive defeats, seemed to be on their way to their next Bundesliga loss.
But then SGE turned up the heat, shooting away their frustration over a mixed season start within a good hour and winning furiously with a 5:2 score. "It's crazy what the boys have achieved today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, expressing a "general praise, to each and every one who was involved."
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, which is still behind their expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result as well.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to be on the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular joy for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live very professionally.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Up next, as part of the English week, there will be an away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (6:30 pm, Sky) on the schedule.
I just received an email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again, or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
This would unfortunately mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for handball women before quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women crept off the court with hanging heads and empty stares after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team suffered a bitter defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we have to perform differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points, behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game from everyone, which we need to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
In the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark, the best German thrower was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to quickly look forward now."
Not up to par from beginning to end.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the kickoff.
Missed throws and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make a scene - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
Thus, the game was already decided at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was shown a red card shortly afterwards due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team get somewhat better into the game and at least closed the gap to five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after just seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is considered a medal contender in the final round.
As a result, the German team could not muster any more improvement and left the court as clear losers.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have secured St. Nicholas Day and are taking this opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
How was it back then at your home?
How about with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children as well?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
The boot polishing?
Baking cookies?
Tree decorating?
Is music being played?
Is it Santa Claus, the Christ Child, or is the gift actually from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort around Christmas to have as nice a time as possible with their family.
Whether these are fixed traditions or even something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number or anything else that could help.
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a voucher code.
just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that possible for you?
The title suggests it, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since a large part of these will soon be finished, I will then continue partly in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility, I am in charge of providing information about the vaccination, determining the indication (the person is eligible for a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and there are no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any [doctors or nurses], but "only" (for heaven's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who are not able to perform vaccinations (are not allowed to?), so that I also perform most of the vaccinations myself there.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
What please is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, submitted by a person from Amberg, the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" has caused intense reflection.
But unlike many previous days, this time the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
And also no one for whom everything has to happen quickly.
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
Upon which the man from Amberg shared the solution, probably causing astonishment among many Upper Palatinate residents.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern."
With this, an educational gap was closed - probably also for quite a few who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little training in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, I started riding my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, a loud hissing and my rear tire absolutely did not want to go along with the rest of the route.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with a somewhat bad mood and take the first available train home.
It wasn't that bad in terms of mood either, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now, however, I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would be extremely reluctant to encounter this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who rode 120km until 2 pm on the day I came to pick up the bike!) were still on it, and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on rollers for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90kms, I believe I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I have started a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in astonishment why I don't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire right now, just to end up being disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I think I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike.
These do exist with the Marathon Plus tires as well (apparently?), but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike to me?
The swallow page seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge!
Thank you in advance for the help and warm regards!
Car skids into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car into a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for an unknown reason and subsequently ended up on the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There, it came to a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man was trapped inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband speaker B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have new additions.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and visually resembles the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitably designed foot is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and, for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
In terms of sound, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in treble.
This is common practice for broadband systems to optimize the strong increase in bundling at too high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outwards, the treble range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction kits, it is recommended to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to incorporate appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the panels have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate location in order to be able to easily route the cable through it later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front is now made so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush-mounted later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual assembly of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front, and the bottom are now glued onto these.
In the process, the three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if required, if for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second side will be attached.
After that, all plates of the foot follow, i.e. both sides as well as the front.
By using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill bit, the installation of the openings for the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is made easier.
Afterwards, use a round cutter to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the base plate can also be rounded off with this.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The next step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5-mm drill bit) the screw connection points of the speaker chassis and the terminal block.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), the cable laying process begins.
This can be achieved most easily through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In this process, the entire uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base up to the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm protruding.
In the upper part of the housing, guide the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang loosely there as well.
The following will prepare and install the crossover frequency.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with a little skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and seal it this way.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this case, so that the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and only have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Due to well-known reasons, we are unfortunately unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people connected via video link, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
