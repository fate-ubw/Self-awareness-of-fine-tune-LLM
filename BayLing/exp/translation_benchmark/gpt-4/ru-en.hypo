From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age based on their interests.
From the 19th-century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those very ladies of Balzacian age.
And the psychology and torments of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not as interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were made of plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of such color and petal structure, resembling velvet, usually in dark red and burgundy shades.
And light roses look different, their petals have just a satin or silky sheen.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mattress 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness levels on its sides: the medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft side is made of a natural latex layer.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeping body, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is naturally well-ventilated, just like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area is maintained.
An extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but in practice, the mattress lasts longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover, included in the set.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow to pair with the mattress - it is recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn on your brain and chase away such relatives!
It's better to have none at all than to have such ones...
Either look for an external driver or someone who is willing to invest and work with you as a partner.

Next time you better think...
Andrey, it was clearly explained to you that retirees work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, they weren't taught this, the school kids are playing games on Windows.
So there is no support at all.
I remember with horror those feasts and guests at my parents' house.
Guests are at the doorstep, and the cutlets are still being fried on the stove, while mom, disheveled, is finishing washing the floor.
Lord, I sat down at the table already exhausted.
And then wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you drag the groceries, two days of cooking, and a day of cleaning up after.
And what about the guests?
They are good, and they must also bring a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays and guests.
Even for my own family, I set the table minimally.
And I cook delicious treats for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: A fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable.
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, Die Welt reports about this.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination."
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omicron."
Moreover, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Yes, the likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new "Omicron" variant of the coronavirus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain," emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Zaltsberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the Delta virus and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel very convincingly demonstrates this," the expert emphasized.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21Â®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed with ice fishing in mind, not just for casting.
These lures have a higher specific weight than their similar-sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
In terms of a "winter vibe" when fishing vertically, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive action.
Often, the most effective is a simple monotonous animation, that is, movements of the fishing rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags, and other obstacles that can cause snagging.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching zander and large perch in winter, especially in the middle of winter when precise and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Upon reaching the end point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successfully used for winter pond trout fishing.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib lure can provoke a passive pike that does not even react to live bait.
During casting, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is easy to understand and not capricious, it goes well with monofilament and braided lines even of large diameters.
For casting fishing for pike, zander, perch or ruffe, besides the uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "scraping" along the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can replace the front treble hook with a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most effective in catching fish.
With equal success, it can be used both on relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, it was reported that there are 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
On Sunday, December 12, the statement was made by Khaled al-Mishri, the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic.
At present, there are more than 7 thousand Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They have airplanes as well.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu agency quotes his words.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Preserve the presence
According to the source of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, according to the agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC receives support from the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is allegedly operating in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagner Group" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered in either the security agencies or the legal entities registry, and its fighters are not present in the personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Wagner."
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Higher State Council of Libya is effectively the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, dominated by Islamists, according to TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the election of parliament deputies and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes - "protected in Syria, restored peace there", "decision on the 'Nord Stream-2'", "scared the whole world with powerful weapons", "we took Crimea back".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," "isolation from the world," according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based administration - all public services have also become digital only.
The Dubai government announced a complete abandonment of paper-based administration and a transition to digital technologies.
All state services for the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
The Emirati news agency WAM reports this.
"Today marked the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," announced on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government institutions will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to electronic government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as estimated by the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

These people definitely knew that there was someone at home...
Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the 2020 level.
Turkey's automobile production and exports sharply declined in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance for the 11 months turned out to be worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey, which is 20% less than the previous year.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if after the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then after 11 months of 2021, car production turned out to be 0.3% worse than last year's indicator.
The reason for such a decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira exchange rate, which depreciated by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
Over 500 SMEs received a deferral on loan payments in 2021.
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in fulfillment of the Head of State's order dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021, No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Payment Deferrals on Loans to Small and Medium Business Entities" was adopted, - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for granting deferrals of loan payments provided for banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities to grant deferrals of payments on loans issued to small and medium-sized businesses, including individual entrepreneurs, before April 1, 2021, for the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME subject.
In the borrower's statement, a different deferral period for payments could have been specified.
During the deferral period, claims and litigation work against the borrower were suspended, as well as notifications about the need to repay overdue debts, and the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," noted the deputy prime minister.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for loan payment deferrals from 603 small and medium-sized business (SMB) borrowers, of which 553 SMBs were granted deferrals amounting to 9.7 billion tenge.
In the MFO, 131 SME subjects applied for a deferral, of which 95 subjects were granted a deferral for a total amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity may be able to easily tolerate the "Omicron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may tolerate it more easily than those with a strong protective response of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the "Omicron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "Omicron" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation, it did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of an immune response, he became very fast.
Apparently, he has more of these spike proteins, spikes, than he should have, and their antibodies were not reduced during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may tolerate "Omicron" more easily than those with a strong protective response of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So it happens with pneumococcal infections when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old elderly people carry it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is furious in the young, it is completely inadequate: where it would be enough to just wag a finger, it hits like a cannon at sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, often only the symptoms can be alleviated - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, vaccination of the younger generation aged 12 to 18 years old may begin by the end of the year.
Virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category suffers very actively from COVID.
The number of contacts is maximum among teenagers who attend school.
"This is the most socially active stratum, just like kindergarten children," Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, told Moskva 24.
Huge gratitude to the author for this article.
With pleasure, refreshed the memories...

In those distant seventies-eighties, no dance floor could do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, when gathering with friends, they would organize dances to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID.
The authors of the study examined adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and discovered that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, showing a strong inflammatory response in the process.
Scientists also studied the adipose tissue of patients who died from COVID and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system response.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
The biologist talked about the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO data, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of specific vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and the absence of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementia development is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"The discussion is ongoing that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," added the biologist.
For the prevention of disease occurrence, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, a professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education RUDN University.
N.I. Pirogov, head of the Cognitive Disorders Department at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country.
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts to their homeland, which were illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, December 11, the head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, announced this on the Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year, 5300 ancient Egyptian civilization artifacts were discovered in the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Currently, the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon their return, the cultural artifacts are restored and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol for help in finding the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, the auction house Christie's held an auction where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and had not been put up for auction since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic ended up in Europe.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers."
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, as Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent nation (close to Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to address work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement information.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but extremely difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego."
He is already outside of any literary associations, has spat out imagism, he is on his own, but well-known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
In a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, including the collection "Soviet Rus."
And the main success - at the end of June of the 25th year, the State Publishing House signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets have been honored like Sergey Alexandrovich, he is the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles monthly for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year like never before.
Esenin married Lev Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofia Tolstaya, and had to arrange family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed that life was getting better, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was predominantly painted in dark shades, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin) had materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't even know where this pain came from.
Is it the wind whistling?
Above the empty and deserted field,
Perhaps, like a grove in September,
Alcohol scrambles the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin has significantly deteriorated, looks bad, and is clearly ill.
More and more often, there are bouts of revelry and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever made for Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, no reliable documents have remained.
Let's say, related to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was recovering his health at a clinic near Paris under the supervision of Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would return to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
And there are plenty of testimonies of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this ground, and police detentions - scattered throughout dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible novel of the poet with the green snake was rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled at the home of his friend, the Imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, despite his quite decent income, Esenin never had his own housing in either Moscow or St. Petersburg; he lived in rented apartments, hotels, or stayed with acquaintances.
Starcev recalls:
He only came to spend the night, and in most cases, he was in an intoxicated, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stair landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Having come to his senses a bit, he began to cough incessantly, splattering the entire sheet with blood...
And even Yesenin himself, after a trip around Europe and the USA (there was Prohibition in the States at that time, but Duncan brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
I didn't see anything there except for pumpkins and streets...
I'm already nearing the end and I stopped remembering people...
Well, and he drank, of course...
And I drank because melancholy devoured me.

Now the son is almost 16, and he has long been free from the desire to act foolishly.
All the energy is focused on choosing what he will be earning a living with.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had occasional problems with the law until our wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love."
Why did the girl start crying during the exam when she hadn't even failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that this is not a school?
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?
Will retake.
Millions of students know this.
What is the conversation about at all?
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon."
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively searching for new ways."
The Polish official also believes that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the website kp.ru reported, the European Union has previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic if the situation in the country does not improve.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"The hat is not according to Senka": when a velvet jacket turns a man into a laughingstock.
At secular events of 2021, velvet jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashionable decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bond-style" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice wore outfits that did not correspond to the royal dress code: first, he wore a green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and later chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was also tried on by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting a growing demand for velvet men's blazers in Russia.
According to the data received by the analysts of the service at "Gazeta.Ru", their purchases increased 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average price of such models ranges from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose velvet suit sets less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are featured in almost all brands this season - including Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is the Gucci one, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci."
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special thread interweaving technology, a dense fabric with a fluffy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget-friendly options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also, accordingly, last for a shorter time.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is perfect if you are going to a party or a festive event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It is also suitable for cases when the invitation indicates a dress code 'Black Tie' or 'Creative Black Tie'."
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows making a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, should acquire the right advanced party with wealth, - believe the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Krasavchik Brammell". - Velvet jacket owners usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets."
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with equally dressy items: classic trousers with creases, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are sure: it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear at a corporate event in a velvet jacket, but if we are talking about a manager who is in charge of the event, then "yes", such an item would be suitable for him.
If the employee is of a lower rank and their goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to obtain financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate it with the phrase "the hat is not for Senka," - believe the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, it's so strained and drawn out.
And it absolutely does not associate with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But I wholeheartedly wish you good luck in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, meaning it is paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not at a loss - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a high demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And who is out in the cold then?
As usual - an ordinary customer.
Do the problems of the Indians concern the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent salary.
Did not see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Simply mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it off to the whole carriage, most likely, people won't sit next to them.
But only due to the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties," but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who recognizes his slave position and fights against it, is a revolutionary."
A slave who does not recognize his own slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious, and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave, whose saliva flows when he smugly describes the charms of a slave's life and admires a kind and good master, is a serf, a boor.
The immunologist stated that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of coronavirus.
Revaccination in four to five months may protect against the new Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
Immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling the vaccination in six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period."
"With the previous strains, such a term was normal, but now it is best to perform the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," the expert said, urging to simultaneously engage in revaccination along with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or has been ill and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then ill, they have acquired 'hybrid immunity,' meaning they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia about "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion into Ukraine.
The countries of the "Big Seven" (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France, and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized in it that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
Next, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities," which US President Biden discussed during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," also state the foreign ministers of the G7.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
"Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
"We will intensify our cooperation on our joint and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting demonstrated the "united voice of the G7 countries," which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia.
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the Omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, however, this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
In this regard, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease progression when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the Omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kyiv.
Head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Oleksiy Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kyiv's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to pursue the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany justified their refusal to provide weapons by the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is confident that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position even with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Kyiv expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany "will be Ukraine's partner in a technical sense," added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

Years... many years ago, I made the same redevelopment.
Combined the living room with the kitchen.
The apartment has three rooms.
Was.
Of course, the project, permission, new technical passport, everything is according to the law.
In the hallway, they made a bookcase and a large wardrobe.
The door to the kitchen was blocked, and a lot of space was created.
In almost 10 years of living in this apartment, we have never regretted the decision.

I've regretted it a hundred times!

The German team "Mercedes", whose pilot Lewis Hamilton finished second in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix behind "Red Bull" racer Max Verstappen, filed a protest against the final result of the race, according to the press service of "Formula 1".

In the first case, the German team disputes the judges' decision to return the lap racers to one lap with the leaders.
According to the second - Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart" zone.
Let's add that now the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Verstappen overtook Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, is considered preliminary, as the date when Mercedes' protests will be reviewed is unknown.

Participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.

UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss at a press conference in Liverpool warned of "major consequences" for Russia in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
"The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quote according to TASS).

Methods of returning money stolen through online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
Their disclosure was made by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Yes, to reduce the risk of significant losses when bank card data falls into the hands of malicious actors, it is recommended to store the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
A portion of the savings can be set aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can initiate the refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a claim with the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition to this, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves refund the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber and director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, there were 11 thousand appeals related to various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream-2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks dedicated to the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2."
Although Scholz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that he will urge Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream-2", which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin announced that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland, determining that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, did not take on public commitments to stop the work of "Nord Stream-2" in case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite the demands of Poland and the United States.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional staffer reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Group of Seven."
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
Removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so you can partially see the second window.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial planning have doubts.
And I know such apartments very well and can clearly see how they have been redesigned.
Let everything be good for them.
It's always surprising when they write about means to clean sinks, toilets, windowsills, and faucets.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or what, so you have to scrub them clean.
Simply do not let it get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Affairs wants to present writers with residences.
The future Fund for the support of Russian writers will receive federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
On its basis, writer's residencies will be created, as reported to the "Parliamentary Newspaper" by the Ministry of Digital Development, which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Digital Development is preparing a draft presidential decree on the establishment of a Fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be entrusted with taking care, among other things, of the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and Litfond.
A significant number of real estate objects previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR have been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the writers' town of Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo in the Leningrad region, and others, - the press service of the Ministry of Digital Affairs informed the "Parliamentary Newspaper".
The draft decree stipulates that the Foundation's charter should state that it is "established for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
"Creating conditions for creative activity" implies the establishment of writers' residences in various regions of Russia based on the transferred property, where comfortable conditions for creativity would be provided," the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.

No, it looks tasty, of course, but the price is just not reasonable.
It seems that only the rich have gathered at Belorusskaya.
Doctors warned about the danger of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after contracting the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Therapist and immunologist Irina Yartseva explained that self-prevention of possible blood clot formation after COVID-19 may provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood-thinning drugs are not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in a stationary condition, and complications were detected.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning medications that prevent excessive blood clot formation) as indicated.
She reported that there is currently a frenzy going on - everyone is taking anticoagulants for a long time and, as a result, experiencing complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The chief preventive medicine specialist of the Ural Federal District, scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, told URA.RU in an interview that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants indiscriminately before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin to engage in self-treatment.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during the preliminary examination before the vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medications without determining the cause of any symptom.

I had such a case.
A lady came to view the apartment.
I came from another city to show it to her.
In the announcement, there were detailed photos and a description of the apartment.
She was extremely dissatisfied because there was no "luxurious" kitchen and "luxurious" balcony.
Apparently, the aunt has nothing to do, so she looks at other people's apartments, and people waste their time.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid 20 thousand dollars.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will receive a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large Lakewood evangelical church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians can expect wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Couli was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packages with money and checks under the insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing."
"We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quotes him.
Judging by all appearances, the find is related to a theft that occurred in the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Couli could not claim this amount, as the term of the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had previously allocated five thousand dollars for the reward and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen regarding the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characterization "as a real person."
That's why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not about the fact that "she is financially much richer than all the scribblers," as they write here.
There are people who are even richer, but not everyone behaves as brazenly, as provocatively, as this madam.

It weighs more than four kilograms.
I want to make it tastier.
I want to find a recipe for chicken baked in pieces in beer.
Haven't you tried this before?
Somehow, I trust you more than just random recipes from the Internet.
In China, a new case of human infection with the bird flu virus has been recorded.
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus has been recorded in China.
Radio station RTHK reported this, citing a notification from Hong Kong's health authorities, according to TASS.
A 68-year-old resident of the urban district of Huizhou in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept domestic poultry, became infected with the infection.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present a vaccination passport upon entering the country.
In Brazil, it has been made mandatory to require COVID passports from those entering the country, a decision made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Roberto Barroso.
CNN Brasil reports on this.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also, the list of exceptions includes individuals arriving from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival, and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso noted.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme for full protection against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When used intranasally, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we produce the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination," the medic explained.
The chief preventive medicine specialist of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in that case, as the body's defense, presumably, should become maximal.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the situation observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the dog (who died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, food, affection, love, and games for a bitch in heat, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and generally smart.
I chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken out of thin air, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after their dog, even though they lamented that there go 200 thousand (Pomeranians) running away, I would directly take their hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, the "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the little dog that was running somewhere out there.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe.
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make COVID vaccination mandatory.
Starting from February of next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters in their hands with the inscription "This is a fake pandemic", "I will not get vaccinated".
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of coronavirus infection cases.
In Luxembourg, over a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of protesters started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even in Wikipedia there is no single opinion on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as the "first Russian doctor, Doctor of Medicine," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe that they both deserve this title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans brought only death and plunder to any country where they appeared.

WHO has detected "omicron" in already six dozen countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rates of the strain's spread were reported in a WHO message.
According to the organization's data, as of December 9, the strain has been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is considering that it only began to spread actively since the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that, according to preliminary data, the new strain may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception, in terms of spread.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omicron" will displace "Delta" in the coming months.
And the number of infected people in Britain alone will be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially, at the moment, only several hundred people in the United Kingdom are suffering from the "Omicron" variant, and according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is currently unknown how the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "Omicron" variant - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omicron" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?
It would be better to see a more detailed execution of your exercises.
It is unclear in the first exercise how to do it: sitting on the heels or standing on the knees, as written, but then how to lean with your hands on your thighs?
Or hands on the waist?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, people communicate easily and casually, but when meeting in person, there is nothing to say.
And seeing a person in real life, maybe it's not what you expected, it didn't hook you - that's where the attitude comes from.
When they meet their person, their views will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called the "time of demons."
Yes, back then people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love thy neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What a mentality today - money at any cost.
Gossips like Globa have little faith (or none at all), but even so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to maintain the warmth of the older generation's relationships.
Maybe it is related to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, oh come on!
Human offspring, especially males, are strong, agile, energetic, they fuss, push, fight, brawl, just like their little "brethren" in the living nature!
It's just a pity that they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are a common thing, and not a boomerang at all!
And for what?
Did you push your little brother, not calculating your strength?
And are you always so skillful that you never accidentally hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

The revenue of the mobile gaming sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. Casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no plot and minimal video design, became the leaders in the number of downloads.

Russians were warned about a new scam scheme.
Malicious actors have begun looking for new scams in video messages.
"Izvestia" writes about this, citing experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Ivideon's Director of Products, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings featuring the victim.
Thanks to this, neural networks can accurately reproduce the behavioral features of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that by using deepfake, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of a person for distribution with the purpose of blackmail.
"Such forgeries can easily provoke bullying, as a knowledgeable malefactor can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Leading Varonis systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this may create specific risks in cases where it comes to technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for heavy makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women also wore makeup and showed their thighs.
So, in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is not enough of the same cosmetics.
Listed are five actions that will help to avoid diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some people do not attach much importance to this, and they are wrong to do so.
Diabetes can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a crucial role in preventing the development of diseases.
Yes, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various beverages and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excessive amounts.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
The development of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to be physically active.
Experts advise sticking to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lose weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to consume a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of fullness, the secretion of digestive juices, and the increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova talked about the "weekend migraine" in workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being over the weekend.
The cause of feeling unwell after working days is often "weekend migraine," explained the well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, and scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, Zuhra Pavlova, on her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics especially often suffer from this, experiencing headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep longer, lie on the couch all day, most likely eat more, and drink less," the doctor argued. "Due to the lack of coffee, a slight withdrawal begins."
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness.
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the "Omicron" variant.
In South Africa, they reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the "Omicron" variant.
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "Omicron") corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which raises doubts about the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, - says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In this regard, specialists clarified that the drug can save from severe disease progression.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
An excess of it in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Users should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the product composition, there may be hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of caloric content, composition, and glycemic index.
On the label, there may be several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated by Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may turn out to be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: Gas will lose its importance for Germany in 25 years.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, by 2045 Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently of great importance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the USA made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation is recorded.
Earlier, the German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the European Union's regulations."
Thank you for the interesting photos!
In 1985, one had to travel to those parts.
I remember perfectly the ChMEZ (Chelyabinsk Mechanical and Electrical Plant) rising from the Kanatchikovo station up the hill, past an old building (resembling a centralization post, two-story), along Kanatchikovsky passage, and turning right onto Vavilova street, towards the factory gates...
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The malefactors managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal means of payment, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the premiere stated that Twitter quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister of India's page was hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonia residents voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
In this case, the level of participation in this third vote became significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of those who voted supported the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
As the France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago hinders a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has largely enlivened the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is the "last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must definitely remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated several times.
A similar statement was made by the Republican candidate ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
From his side, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be the choice of France."

Just don't forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity wasn't as widespread as it is now.
And here medicine was at zero - leeches, garlic, and decoctions.
Now they would have put on their feet in an instant.
And the food has nothing to do with it.
In Turkey, the world's first drone with laser weapons was tested.
In Turkey, successful tests of the world's first drone with laser weapons were carried out.
The UAV "Eren" was tested at distances from 100 to 500 meters, reports "MIR24".
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the new product reaches 3 thousand meters.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV should be adopted by the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing their own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article about Russia-US relations.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of offensive statements about the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand united against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"In this article, there is quite a lot of false information," RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land."
The USA and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," noted another.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands.
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Kuril Island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The hearth was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin producing new generation jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will begin to create ANKA-type jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
On December 11, freelance advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Alexey Arestovich, reported on this.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
"They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and the like," - quotes him Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA UAVs, Arestovich said that they are jet-powered, not piston-powered.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs must be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aerial vehicle was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the joint forces' military operations in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone manufacturing plant has begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kyiv region, where personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs, will be conducted.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
At the airport, two lions escaped from a container.
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
The Straits Times reports on this.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him due to the protective net installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of employees from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions using tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and no people were harmed.
Experts warned of the cancer risk due to vitamin B9.
Research shows that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express publication warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a deficiency of folic acid are at a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only in case of a significant deviation from this number in either a larger or smaller direction.
Kitchen recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocado, Fain recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the United Kingdom, by April, about 75,000 people may die due to the Omicron strain.
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened during the winter.
The newspaper The Guardian reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record at least 25,000 fatal outcomes due to the Omicron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
In this case, at the peak of the disease, hospitals will admit more than 2 thousand infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the Delta variant, and current vaccines cannot prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the spread rate of the Omicron variant remains at the current level, by the end of the year, about 1 million infection cases will be detected in the country.
In this case, by mid-December, the Omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus have been detected in the United Kingdom, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
In this regard, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality, this figure may already reach 10 thousand cases.

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide.
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for the next year are breaking all records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the global ship registry, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the consequences of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress worth 50 million dollars or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, their number is increasing.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there hasn't been such a hype in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the rich do not want to understand that in times of hardship, space travel, living on yachts, or flying on private planes cause irritation in society, as the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to take action and propose introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, implementing this will be extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, not only the number of ordered super-yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a stern length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire RÃ¸kke is building a 183-meter long yacht called REV Ocean.
After being launched, this will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" and a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads, open-air cinemas have become common, and on some of them, such as the yacht of fighter McGregor, there is a platform for martial arts. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, considering that there are just over 2000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
In this case, two-thirds of the emission trail fell on his 162.5-meter-long yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Super yacht owners do not elicit sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no place to dock their gigantic vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters long.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified, leading to the development of colon cancer.
American scientists have determined the amount of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
The publication Daily Express writes about this.
Experts have concluded that consuming four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
In this case, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, the risk of developing bowel cancer is higher in moderately drinking men than in women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, only noting that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not realize how advanced four-legged pets actually are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine the development of intelligence in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the Sciencealert edition.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they know nothing about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding words of human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
Yes, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are not inferior to a two-year-old child in their ability to learn.

In Ukraine, they prepared for the trade between the USA and Russia.
The USA and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov stated in his article for the publication "Glavred."
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future regarding the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join wherever they want."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you wouldn't start bargaining, but simply send the proposer away.
"As for Ukraine, a trade is being planned," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kyiv.
"The preparation is carried out covertly and quickly, and they immediately proceed to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and counteracting forces to be deployed," he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou city, Hunan province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, noted company representative Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, ensuring increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the first China-developed double-decker high-speed electric trains intended for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement along this metro line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China International Trade Development Committee (CITDC).
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market," said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of intense work, conducting a series of independent research and development, China has created an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaosyan, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin listed the early signs of dementia in a conversation with Sputnik radio.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a debate about whether hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of specific vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, medical professionals do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however, their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community," said Golosheykin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheykin.
Earlier, a UK dementia research charity stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Medical professionals have named early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Experts have identified another sign of developing dementia as aphasia - a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad.
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-neurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze told journalists, who is a member of the medical board created under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
"Stable problems include issues with mobility, coordination, and mood swings," said the specialist, noting that this is within normal limits and now the former president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a specialized institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage receiving medical assistance after the penitentiary service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

How many mouths can a working person feed?
We feed all the alcoholics and drug addicts who have also lost their health due to their own stupidity.
Then we wonder about the extension of the retirement age.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protest actions were held against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for visiting bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the event without masks.
On their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respecting the citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry to entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, and over 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned to be introduced for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit mass event venues, cultural institutions, public catering facilities, and retail outlets by presenting either a certificate of vaccination or a past illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for trips on trains and airplanes.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to engage in winter sports, which will allow for the collection of 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of underdeveloped remote provinces.
The Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among the Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening works are also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
In the country, there are more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international level competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to ensure a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is still far from that.
Games Organization Advisor Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese people head to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, believes Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the venue of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now not a single local resident suffers from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
Catering points with national cuisine dishes are opening on the slopes.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China strives to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach a world-class level.
Over 500 million people worldwide may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, according to the WHO.
Over 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity's progress in achieving universal access to healthcare services, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Universal Health Coverage Day celebrated on December 12, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive strain on healthcare systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has decreased, and the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
In the WHO and the World Bank, it was emphasized that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people practically have no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from broadcast at "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The performance of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technologies Audrey Tang at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a no-video mode, as evidenced by the summit recording on YouTube.
The Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was marked with a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was created by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the level of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily represent the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could contradict the "One China" policy adhered to by Washington.
One of the agency's sources stated that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate summit, the editor-in-chief of "Novaya Gazeta," Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."

Write that they are "scoundrels, didn't return the money."
And as for how many and when they should have children, it's none of your business, as long as they don't plan to burden you with those children.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Probably, it's only like this in education...

China is strengthening prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border checkpoints are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the PRC has issued a circular calling for the strengthening of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in cities with land border crossings, in order to further prevent the importation of infections from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who arrive in cities where land border checkpoints are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the relevant administrative units of the provincial level determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land border checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they spoke about the "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
In an interview with "Izvestia", Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov assessed the prospects of Moscow and Washington's relations.
He noted that the long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but as for any prospects of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the results of a long journey that we have gone through with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
"The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress is not observed.
In this context, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during a meeting with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warned about the danger of vaccinating with a nasal COVID drug outside of hospitals.
In those who have been vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine, an allergy may occur and they may need medical help, so it is not advisable to organize the first vaccination points with this drug at airports and shopping centers.
TASS was informed about this by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
Organizing vaccination points with nasal vaccines at airports and shopping centers is easier, but I would initially do it only in medical institutions.
The thing is, there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is preferable for a person to sit near the doctor's office after that.
"Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very necessary," Netesov stated.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to consider vaccination in shopping centers when there is accumulated experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important for it to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
In this case, there is a probability that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated blows their nose after the injection when they have nasal congestion.

Lama, they say, the true believers make up the church.
Whether these true believers exist or not, we cannot know.
Each of us would like to be such a truly faithful person, and everyone tries to be one.
But no one should say about themselves or about those who believe the same way as they do that they are the only truly faithful ones.
Because if they can say about themselves that they are truly believers, then exactly the same can be said by others.

Attention, question - what is KlÃ¦bo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get on the ski track if he was behind at the turn before the gate?

In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus were recorded in 24 hours - RT in Russian.
In 24 hours, 1,239 cases of infection with the new Omicron strain of coronavirus have been identified in the United Kingdom.
Sky News reports on this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with the new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a pessimistic forecast, estimated that in England, by April, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain, 75,000 people could die.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"Introducing some restrictions against Russia and not experiencing suffering oneself is impossible," said the official representative of the Kremlin on the air of the "Russia 1" TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
It was previously reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
In this regard, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is confident that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the territory of France.
On December 12, the French TV channel BFM.TV reported this.
96.5% of those who voted spoke out against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
Annulled the results of 2.99% of the ballots.
The voter turnout on this day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the separatists' calls to refuse participation in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on the issue of independence was already held in the region.
The majority of residents supported the inclusion of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20 thousand kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, and the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia from 1998, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year difference.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta."
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the "Omicron" variant is less dangerous than the Delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is data on the reduced effectiveness of vaccines when dealing with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, the "Omicron" variant has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigenic profile of the Omicron strain protein suggest a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it (the "severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with the "Delta" variant, according to a technical report from the WHO.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with "Omicron" in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the new strain is spreading faster than the "Delta."
In Russia, two cases of infection with the Omicron strain have been registered.
"They were previously immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data yet on whether the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named.
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may lose the support of the West and may also make compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko talked about this in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first scenario, which Denisenko called the "perfect storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
"Alongside this, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> domestic protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FIGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.)", - added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the situation to develop - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in global politics, during which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to such a situation, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbass, which could lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which may lead to the seizure of control over the security forces and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
During such a crisis scenario, Zelensky will begin the "reformatting of power," added Denisenko.
Another scenario is Zelensky's transformation into the "father of the nation."
This can be caused by a certain event that will become a strong shock for society.
"The event must be large-scale enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," said Denisenko.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, believes the former deputy.
In this regard, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the approval rating of the Ukrainian president has dropped to a record low, reaching 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his election as the head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would cast their vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the country's ex-president Petro Poroshenko.
In this case, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great sportswoman, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it's very upsetting to learn such things.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, the residents of Primorsky Krai, it was live, real-time.
Such a passion, emotions were off the scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in other victories, as they rooted for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the Soviet athletes at that time.
I once saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and there they rolled watermelons down a ramp onto a ship, like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous size.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the field and not earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, item number: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups, on underwires.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of the strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the scalloped edge along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical bones on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting on larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it's mean and venomous.

Arrested for the action on Red Square, the poet said: "For quoting Yevtushenko, they give 10 days, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained in Red Square with a poster that had the hashtag #Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÐ²ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ¸Ð¸Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐµÑÐµÐ¼Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑ written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up for Alexander under the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public event.
He was first detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, as currently the interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of overall culture in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We got in touch with the young poet to find out the circumstances of the delay and to more fully reveal the message of his communication.
How did the police officers treat you during this arrest and previously?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time the employees were more professional, the detention was as polite as possible, as funny as it may sound in some context of this word.
At Pushkinskaya, the OMON officers took action and they did it harshly.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked not approvingly, but understandingly.
Except for the monkey cage blown on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the event under this hashtag a few people start writing their own poems, then these 10 days of waiting will not be in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak privately even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak in the language of the surrounding people so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is just a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly well and yet resorts to the help of a translator.
And at official events, the shorthand is still done with a fountain pen in the old-fashioned way, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
You don't want many words, just say no!
And there's so much water.

Before that, convert all assets into liquid shares.
And gradually sell these shares, opening an account in any bank in the world.
Sell not in dollars, but in a currency less dependent on the US, for example, Swiss francs.
And then proceed with filing for divorce from America.
However, this is not all that keeps Americans in the USA.
Their confidence holds that in the USA it is better than anywhere else.
They are raised like that.

Researchers explained how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that contribute to improved blood circulation and reduced cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in combating age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption, it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or boil the root vegetable, rather than frying it in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express publication warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing products that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current production deficit can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm, and other pirates will be removed from Yandex search results.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the RuNet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive, partly due to the regular change of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - an original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the video quality, it is a so-called camrip (a pirated copy of the film recorded in a movie theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TV series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.
Svetlana M., excuse me, of course, but I couldn't care less if the son gets offended for his mother or not.
If there is some kind of misunderstanding between us, it's better not to interfere at all, just sweep it away on your way.
It's good, of course, that such things happen rarely.

Lyudmila, China currently has the most advanced space technology.
Russia has already hopelessly fallen behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland merely adapted the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
Actually, the slogan "The Outskirts are not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, in general, doesn't really change the essence.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream is to grow wings, and her dad constantly scolds her.

Maytoni Tessara MOD081WL-L13G3K wall lamp.
A wide circumference, framed by "molecules" of light, provides maximum uniform and bright illumination of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, does not lose its relevance and allows you to advantageously place accents in the interior.
One of the distinctive features of such luminaires is the lightweight construction.
Thanks to the thin, almost invisible cables that are adjustable in height, it creates the impression that the chandelier is floating in the air.
The metallic gold fittings and matte white miniature ceiling lights will easily complement any color palette, and the presented collection of hanging chandeliers and wall lamps will become a ready ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom, and hallway.
Well, as they say, there's no accounting for taste.
I really liked "Tarkhun," not the current one, of course.
The juices poured from tall glass cylinders were very tasty.
Three portions of syrup is overkill, in my taste.
Two were just right.
Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient in that it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high rigidity and slightly above average.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: a block of independent "micro-package" springs is installed in the center of the model.
This means that there are 2000 coils per sleeping area, which operate completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique pinpoint adjustment.
The "Micro Package" is the highest frequency spring block among the entire variety of "Dimax" spring blocks, therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of coconut coir and natural latex layers are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long held the status of a classic, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides proper back support, then the latex provides surface adaptation to the human body.
Case: the model comes in a quilted Aloe Vera knit case.
Upon the client's request, it can be made either removable or stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported "Aktualnaya Kamera" on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to Earth's or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
"If it turns out to be different, then it might become more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project.

Metaverses will change Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, businesses in Russia, as well as all over the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
With the third - they represent a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing one's diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat at the celebration, but no one is forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can have a spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are indeed ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish work, time, and resources it took her during the training sessions.
And after completing 5 quadruple jumps, she remained without gold.
And she also understands that she won't be able to endure the 4 years until the next Olympics, meaning she will never become an Olympic champion.
And those who have not simply engaged in sports or cannot imagine all the circles of hell that she has gone through, DO NOT JUDGE.
The British economist could not provide a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to provide a forecast for 2022, as in his opinion, such attempts would result in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in goods prices is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks had outlived itself" and it was time to return to relations where interest rates, taking into account inflation, would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the global research department at "Otkritie Investments" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 are maintained, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, oil price dynamics, and concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I am forced to agree.
But there is one consolation: if you compare yourself to yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
Now it's better.
There is progress, just sluggish.
There is also such a problem: there are many ecological initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
Various eco-taxis that collect waste from home.
Even a simple recycling collection point is used by marginal people.
Few people bring glass and metal there.

They don't release "Pilot", and "Daisy" is not the same at all...

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP.
As a result of the first 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research agency (NAPI).
For understanding the scale - approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state on supporting citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In the past September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
At the related Kia brand Hyundai, the increase is even more significant - over 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also leading in terms of the increase in the average weighted price of a car - over the year, it has grown by almost 21% for Hyundai, reaching 1.94 million rubles - the price increase dynamics were stronger only for Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz.
In this context, the sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow as significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closing the top three leaders in sales volume in monetary terms is the Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales volume (by 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (almost by 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"At Mercedes-Benz, we are seeing a good growth in sales and average price at the same time - more, for example, than at BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadzhi.
Chinese brands demonstrate fantastic growth rates in sales, having also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.
The Russian Lada demonstrates average market growth dynamics in terms of revenue (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
Companies that are at the level of the previous year in terms of financial capacity, whose car sales in units fell in 2021, include Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
UAZ is even in the red - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Amid problems with auto component supplies and production disruptions affecting the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to constantly adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" has raised the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, with the latest increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurring at the end of November.
Regularly, they rewrite price tags for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the car deficit, inflation and the desire of car manufacturers to make up for past losses contribute to this, experts believe.
In conditions of car shortage, I think that many car manufacturers were even able to partially shift the costs of past periods onto the consumer, which they could not include in the price of cars before.
Analyst of VTB Capital in the automotive industry, Vladimir Bespalov, says.
I believe that in financial terms, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, maintaining high sales margins.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices, which has been observed throughout 2021, with the prices of new cars rising faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the growth of supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, car manufacturers will be able to receive their income due to the volume, notes independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the maximum profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the volume of machine production is not expected for at least the next six months, while in Russia, the hype is further fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
In the context of the current market situation, cars have turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, the expert notes.
Biden commented on the deployment of US military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion.
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion."
U.S. President Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There have never been such plans," stated the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
In this context, he emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will deploy forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to deploy more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries to which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden stated.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
In this regard, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey to Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I leave such interviews immediately.
If during the interview they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some unclear swill, and even wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an HR layer, where you immediately talk to the manager.

The mattress is perfect for both a single person and a couple.
The latter will especially appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of the "wave" effect, when oscillations on one side of the mattress can be transferred to the opposite side, disturbing a person in their sleep.

If a scammer calls from a similar number, posing as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another security agency, it is not effective to immediately hang up, and most likely, there will not be enough time to add them to the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about involvement with the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
Here's such nonsense...
I really don't believe that it was like that.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
Reached the Queen of goodness.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except for the very best...
Wouldn't it be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their own people?
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, the influence weakened and the number of infections decreased...
Assorted Felting Wool Set "Assorti No. 2" 100% Merino, 4x10g wool.
Felting wool as a craft originated eight thousand years ago, but it was very difficult to find animal wool for this activity, let alone colored wool.
But now voila!

Embody your ideas by "rolling" this wonderful wool!
Maria Kartashova, what does "in response to this" mean?
I don't voice my thoughts, I mentally curse you all.
In my mind, I cut off the heads of everyone who didn't give me a place, mentally send all the cars that obstruct my passage into a ditch and burn them, mentally everything!
And from the outside, I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!
Peter, during the years of his reign, Nicholas II did not sign a single death sentence.
Even to such reckless people as Koba and his brigade.
And the Bloody Sunday is already a fabrication of the Bolsheviks.

The film by Alexander Sokurov's student received the European "Oscar" for best editing.
The Oscar-nominated Russian film "Leviathan" received the European Film Academy Award (also known as the "European Oscar") for Best Editing, reports "Moskovsky Komsomolets."
The jury of the competition, voting online due to the complex epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding craftsmanship of the film's creators.
This time, the film "Quo Vadis, Aida?" by Jasmila Å½baniÄ (Bosnia) received the maximum number of awards.
The main heroine of the film is a UN mission interpreter who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching the Fists," directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells the story of the complex relationship between a domineering father and his adult children who want to break free from his control in North Ossetia.
It was previously announced that this film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, out of the loop.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
