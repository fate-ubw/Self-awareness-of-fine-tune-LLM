Unfortunately, I must decline your proposal as I have already found a job.

Sometimes it seems to me that my thoughts expressed in Czech differ from those written by me in Ukrainian through a translator.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree with the course.

If there are no options, then I agree anyway.
Thank you in advance.

Zelensky: Mariupol - the heart of the war, stop fighting - we will be in a weak position
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the fighting in eastern Ukraine and, in particular, in Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äì if the Ukrainian army suffers defeat there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and once again occupy the de-occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Maripol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will be in a weaker position.
They (city defenders - ed.) - people who took on a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the eastern part of the country, in the (Donetsk) region, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have the advantage in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we are weak in all these areas, we can dispense with a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They might just do that.
Then our negotiating position will be weaker and even uninteresting for the Russian side.
Alas, we note.
We believe in our result, in our victory.
Details: Zelensky also said that going to the negotiations after the persecution of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we must not lose the opportunity for diplomatic solution, if they will be".
Straightforward: "People will take the world as it is because people want this war to be over.
On our terms, the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family lost something - and I don't think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we speak rationally, the war should end in peace, or end in millions of casualties.
And even there, where millions died, it all leads to the end of the war.
So we must fight - but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there is nothing else, when there are no people."
Good day, do you have any free places on the Czech course for adults starting at 7 p.m. on Tuesdays?

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who participated in committing war crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by UNIAN, this was announced by the Chief Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The list of military personnel of the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, who directly participated in the committing of military crimes against the Ukrainian people in the city of Bucha, - is stated in the report.
The Ministry of Defense notes that all war criminals who have committed crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine will be brought to justice and held accountable.
The list can be viewed by following the link.
As reported by UNIAN, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were cleared of Russian occupiers.
Mass killings of civilians by Russian soldiers have been documented in liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
General Prosecutor Iryna Venediktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of peaceful residents were removed from the territory liberated from Russian occupiers in the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian invaders' troops shell and destroy key objects of infrastructure, carry out mass shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian towns and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and aviation bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have money for two months of rent, the area in Ostrava does not matter, I would be very grateful.
Most of my friends are shocked by the news of the brutal treatment of civilians north of Kiev.
The photographs of the executed and machine-gunned people shocked the whole civilized world.
Tens of people ask each other how it could happen in the 21st century?! How?!
Absolutely nothing surprised me. It is precisely what I had expected with awe...
I evacuated children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then he went to work in the capital, only after the girls-colleagues with children.
I have been helping the Ukrainian army since 2014 and not once did I doubt that my family would be spared in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev.
I am and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
It cannot exist without terrorism, it is built on terrorism.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in the prison in Zhitomir.
A few years ago, the SBU in Zhytomyr gave permission to copy the case files of his grandfather, who was shot: the entire case consists of more than a hundred pages, but the sentence - that of death - is very simple, and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, and denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, Catholic, with five children, he was a free man, poor "small-holder" nobility, never served serfs.
The fact that they lived in a cottage and had a few cows was enough to sentence the peasants to death.
Relatives did not even know where he was buried.
My grandmother said that they took almost a hundred people from the village and killed all of them except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
The name of the striker is Sharia.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I am not surprised that his relative was a KGB informer.
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that carried out the executions of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his grandfather, he became interested in various informational resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) informational resources in Russia such as "Immortal Barracks" that qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
Therefore, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and eliminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of Stalin's victims and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system discredited them first and then destroyed them.
For example, on a computer they found child pornography files, for which he was sent to prison, where he died quickly.
The KGB is still killing those who try to find out the truth about crimes committed in the past century.
To what do you suddenly find surprising about their actions now?!
The most despicable features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperialism of the 16th to 19th centuries were superimposed on the thousand-year-old nomadic tradition.
And then they made a beastly genetic experiment, lopping off intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Check out the semi-French film "Checkpoint" from 1992 and it was just like that.

So we took her home and immediately took her aunt.
She thanked me so much, she cried.

It's like that, but we don't know our way around the area and don't know where everything is. Today we looked for a supermarket for an hour and then walked back. The pram is too small for two, so we need a large one.
Even now, I am thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Your dad is the only one in the family who can speak Russian, right?
Maybe the kids could come to Wales and play in the hall
Well, let's take the risk then :)
I am also glad to have met you.

The flowers bloomed. Everything is normal. All the vacationers are very nice.
As reported by European Truth, this was written by Welt with reference to sources in the Ukrainian government,
A proposal to this effect was sent to the German Ministry of the Economy on Saturday, according to the publication.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training sets and spare parts, amounts to EUR 1.7 billion.
As also offered howitzers in the BTR Boxer version for EUR 120 million.
While tanks have to move relatively close to their targets in combat, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can engage targets at a distance of over 30 kilometres.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
In the short term, the Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps created will then be filled with industry on the second stage.
The first new howitzers could be delivered within 30 months of the contract being signed, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
Full supplies will not be completed until 2027.
So, will we meet in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day?

The fight lasted about an hour and a half.
How much money do I have on this number?

From Tuesday 4.
Refugees from the war in Ukraine will be able to apply for humanitarian aid at a new place of work managed by the Labor Office at the Prague market in 2022.
The office number 29 is designed specifically to accept and process applications for assistance, so there is an interpreter on site.
Lyudmila has already been enrolled in school, but we will take her to the teacher on Tuesday because of her illness, the teacher informed me today.
I am sitting, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, my dear, how it is with thee?
I know, it's hard for you.
But for me it is such that we are together. That we are a pair.
I would have said that there would be a lot of work after the war.
So I am not afraid that I will not find it there.
I know a lot.
So I am not afraid that I did not get into any of them.
I just don't know about accommodation.üò¢üò¢üòü
I need to obtain a food production license. Can you help me with that?
Please help, tomorrow we need to prepare an apartment for 5 guests.
Is the fifth place I understand in the room with the TV?
Unpack and lay the sofa?
Shall we stop here while Mrs. Margaret finds us accommodation?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, already used, but it works but not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, look at the map where it is located
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan anything with furniture this week. I finally want to see that apartment and then understand what furniture I need.
Excuse me for such a long response, working day was difficult to adapt
Is that enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe and I want to be with you, to have this chance to hold you.
To kiss you good morning, tell you how you look.
There is a cot and a small table and chairs for the toddler, things that we found at first
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you have the opportunity, but not to give up ü§´üòüüòâüôÉ
I want to do a haircut that is called a bob.
Oleg was ill - coughing and sneezing. It would be better if Jan didn't come to us, so as not to catch it
I will be a little later - around 8. Is that okay?
I don't want to misunderstand you.
But I worry that everything will go wrong!?
But we did not even talk about these excursions!
I understand how important it is for you!
As for myself, I am silent (for me this is just the pinnacle that cannot be reached)!
How do you feel today? üòÖ After the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, I slept terribly
Excuse me, I'm disturbing you.
I was upset that we yesterday started translating the test poorly with Cola.
I will ask Grigory Denisenko or Yonashenko)) to help me a little with mathematical concepts.
Can I and they somehow be useful?
If that were possible, I would like to brush up on my mathematical terminology over the holidays.
Geometry is hard, but we have to work with the Column so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We are also very hopeful about this.
So she was very glad to be my present
I wanted to connect to the internet with my Czech number
Yesterday, on bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian, Victoria.
This girl - a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and pain...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And last night I was thanking God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine who felt my heart.
The number 29 department is designed specifically for the acceptance and processing of applications for assistance.
It turned out that I had ordered a spare map
No, I am a simple person
So she wouldn't be scared that nobody came.
I didn't go. I baked it myself. Yes, I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to switch on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Eighty years ago, in the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babi Yar.
I had the honour of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This is something we need to defend - it is part of our responsibility associated with our history."
If "the bad demons of the past appear today in a new disguise," he said, "for us Germans there can only be one answer: never again!
The struggle continues."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the residents of blockaded cities and gave them diseases to die from.
The Russian army is carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it reminds of the shootings in Babi Yar.
For over a month Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany is introducing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid and arms that would have been unimaginable a short while ago.
Germany is dragging out the delivery of heavy weapons that Ukraine needs.
But "Never again!" means not only to be against the swastika.
This means to fight all possible means against massacres, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way to defeat evil and stop the atrocities occurring in Ukraine without risks and sacrifices.
Listen to one song for me
We agree, let's make a plan for the excursion and I'll write when we are gathered
Everyone was sick, but Lidya did not get sick among them, there was a new type of flu.
I will do it tomorrow.
I use this token instead of a card
Bleep for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the conductor.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Donbass, the number of opponents of NATO began to decline, while supporters, on the contrary, increased.
After the start of full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support among Ukrainian citizens for Ukraine's accession to NATO ‚Äì over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the help that the alliance provides in wartime, there is now much criticism of the alliance and its Ukrainian members - for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "provoke" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse membership in the alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation if this can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the "Critical Questions" podcast, we talk to the editor of European Truth about how the Alliance has actually been helping Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should and should not criticize, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever and why security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think about here
My Volt partner noted what my claim is about.
I sent it through this mobile app
No visas, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was issued in Poland, there they did not give visas, but pepper.
You will definitely hear from us!
Denis went out today in a good mood.
He agreed to meet the Ukrainian boy he met yesterday near the school to show him everything.
Therefore, I hope everything is going well for him.
But I don't like it, I can't stand it for long
It is reported in Ukraine that the Czech Republic has sent tanks T-72 and infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I go and leave the children there for 3-4 years and go home because I can no longer stay.
And take the brothers with him at 6-7 a.m.
So, a heavy heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, however, he acted improperly and I left him.
After a while he came back and asked my forgiveness.
I said no to him.
Then he called back a short while later to say he was having heart surgery.
Having asked him just to chat, I was sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
We've been talking a lot.
At that time, problems at work began for me in parallel.
His support helped me at that time too.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe it's time to look at it differently.
And he proposed to me two days before he died.
Therefore, God decided our fate.
So what does being marriage material mean for you?
And he only speaks Czech
Wanted to say that I managed to find housing, and I am very glad ‚ò∫ now I have where to live and where to be with the child.
Did I have to remind you earlier?
)))) Because I helped look after the children in the family.
Don't be shy. Just write, which sentences you didn't understand.
I understand myself that the translator does not always correctly translate the text.
I don't know how to speak with a doctor, or whether she needs to give him paper?
They certainly forgot, I put it in the wardrobe
It's probably time to go to bed so you can work tomorrow
Can someone help? Needed items for a woman size XS or S, height 165cm. Also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you.
That time I bought two packs and my mom bought two

You lifted my mood.
Good, let's talk about something else, because I won't sleep otherwise and I'll dream that I'm being bombed...
God is never late, everything has its own time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the value of unskilled labor and understand that I will not be able to have such a job as I had in Kiev here and will not be able to earn such money as I earned at home.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all bad thoughts rush into my head, so I need to occupy myself with some physical activity.
Documents are issued at the airport from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., otherwise you can just wait.
Volodymyr turned up at 4 a.m.
So we took them in.
We fell asleep in the kitchen, and they put us to bed.
I finished work and went with them to the airport.
If he is, write and find out what happens next...
Then I cannot find a place for myself

He is coming to visit you.
Could you please tell me if you have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments on a monthly basis, or at least for an approximate understanding, on which days?
I will never forget this schedule )
Russian army threatens to launch rocket attacks on Kiev: say "not done before
Konashenkov's direct words: "Let's see attempts at diversions and attacks by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the RF.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will deliver strikes on centers of decision-making, including in Kiev, which the Russian army previously refrained from."
Russians have been launching rocket attacks on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian occupation troops in Ukraine.
On February 25, remnants of Russian rockets that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Pochynok area.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Prospekt.
On March 1, a Russian missile hit a telecommunications tower near Babino Yar, resulting in the deaths of five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, debris from a rocket fired by occupiers destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vinohradar, causing the death of one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On 21 March, Russian rockets destroyed the modern Retroville mall in Vinohrady, killing at least four people.
Kiev's mayor Vitaly Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that residents of the capital, who had evacuated from the city, should not yet return.
The military told local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket attacks on Kiev, in addition to a large number of mines and unexploded ordnance in the capital's suburbs.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist acts on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
An oil depot near Belgrade in Russia exploded on April 1, supposedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Clearly, the elites in Washington and Berlin shiver at the thought that NATO hunters may shoot down Russian bombers over Ukraine.
But Zelensky is speaking not so much to them as to their voters and the wider public.
With his speeches in parliament and to crowds in the squares of Europe's biggest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something his predecessors could never have imagined.
Zelenskyy is not persuading European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he is persuading European nations, which elect these politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated blend of strength, emotion and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's entry, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered cheaters.
The money you collect is better given to those who need it more.
I can come to you and solve the problem on the spot. I want to help you anyway

Contact: ------ it would be nice to have an email, so that the Czechs could write to you through a translator, SMS doesn't work, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, they won't agree.
Do you really want this price?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they are for.
If you don't need a price list, I won't bring it up.
Tell me how you want it and I will do it.
You didn't want me to write to you today. Why?
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for anything.
More accurately - today I ask only for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I beg your patience.
Is everything all right with you?
You live your ordinary life, go to work, plan purchases and vacations.
You have a dream.
You are planning to buy that same dress we saw at the shopping center yesterday.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain cannot process it.
He peels off for the old reality.
You call your boss to find out - are you working today or not.
You are deciding to keep the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it will not last long.
Now ... negotiating ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? Nobody and nowhere.
I had 50$ in my pocket, all we spent at home.
Many bosses didn't pay us for overtime work.
Where should I go? Who do I need? How to provide for children? Where should I live?
You can't take on many things at once.
You didn't take anything with you from home... so you had to travel 1000 kilometers.
You do not know whether they will feed them to you tomorrow, or not.
Every day, from morning until evening, you are dragging the children around all of Prague.
And then? Unknown. How much? Unknown. The children ask for candy. And you can't. It's expensive.
And every little bit helps - we don't have that.
It's our choice - to stay there and to call the children to the danger or to try to save ourselves here
She was very pleased with the valentines and the gifts the kids gave her when she came to school

Will you be busy tomorrow? Do you not want to meet after 4 p.m.?
What are your overall impressions of the first week
Karina brought us medicine just now, and we are taking them.
I can work with lying-down patients and children with disabilities.
But it is certainly necessary to indicate that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.

Can I ask you a question?
But there only gel antibacterial
I am not sure, I am not really familiar with the city yet. around half past 12
What services/activities, in your opinion, are necessary/absent for elderly people?
I don't know, but there was no SMS from the bank and I didn't take the bank's card, and the children withdrew the bank's application, which greatly surprised me.
Then write to me, please, how you will go üôèüèª
Today we are happy - our city Bucha has been liberated from occupants, our troops have arrived.

These are small business owners who set up volunteer teams in their premises and shops.
These are the tractor drivers who, in fact, go out to the fields under fire, because it is time to sow.
They are the drivers of the buses who today agree to travel in convoys through the occupied territories, in order to take help there and pick up people there.
These heroic conductors drive fearlessly into the combat zone, calm and help refugees in the carriages, and on peaceful stations help volunteers load humanitarian goods into the carriages.
These petrol stations which stood on the Kiev highway in the first days of the war and patiently served people who were shaken and nervous.
These communal workers, who remove rubbish under fire, repair water pipes and electricity lines in order to provide people with what they need.
These doctors and nurses, who work 24 hours a day saving people, do not complain about anything, and in their free time they volunteer, collecting medicine chests for the front.
In Ukraine, the seeds stop growing when they are small)
Say, please, little children - what age are you referring to?
Is it appropriate for my 8-year-old daughter?
I am looking for accommodation for us with our daughter for 3-4 days to come to Czechia and submit our passports for visa application in Canada.
In Warsaw a lot of people at the visa center and no online queue.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far, and the train journey takes a long time, and it would be hard for the child.
Therefore, she decided to look for accommodation in Prague or not far from it.
No, we are all happy
Yesterday's scales

Up to that point - stamps such and then equated these stamps to visas
The foreign electoral district of Ukraine (ZECU) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of premises for voting in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises on foreign military bases where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of Congo).[1] The role of the district electoral commission for the ZECU is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only national elections are held in the foreign electoral district: presidential and parliamentary elections and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in ZVO are not held.

I didn't need any other device for that, I went to the O2 operator and they gave me an electronic SIM card which I put into my phone, so I don't need any other device.
Thank you. It's very uncomfortable for me, I work on Sunday and already can't.
You said that your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. It is also very necessary for you.

Went to school today too.
Today I saw Christina's mother, but she didn't even say hello to me.
Delicious apple, what kind is it?
The head of the presidential administration, Andrei Ermak, said that Russia is beginning a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that our allies give us.
Straightforward language from Yermak: "They understand they are losing the war, see their backwardness and strive to 'beat' arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the last hoaxes - allegedly the destruction of the S-300 missile systems sent by Slovakia.
Prime Minister Eduard Heger has refuted this information.
What next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Let's name one of them.
They can spread fake news that Ukrainian soldiers are allegedly surrendering with weapons to the allies, and it is massively transferring to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to forestall such lies at once.
But the arms in the hands of the Ukrainian soldiers exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Please excuse me, would you mind asking how much the kindergarten costs per month and whether it operates during the summer?
Everything is given to the skin.
There are much sadder stories, believe me.

However, she was baptized in a Orthodox church.
I respect all religions that are based on love.

The international community continued to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged of Russian forces committing atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, which Moscow denounced as "provocation."
The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, stated to journalists in Wellington on April 4 that "the killing, raping, and severe wounding of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops must be condemned."
Russia must answer to the world for what they've done, she said, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The claims came after reports that hundreds of unarmed civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets of the suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who had entered the area after the occupation of several weeks.
Photographs purporting to show the bodies of civilian prisoners with their hands tied shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and for those responsible to face criminal charges.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in an April 4 radio interview that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Chechnya.
What happened in Budapest requires a new round of sanctions and very clear steps, Macron said, adding that any additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said that Russian troops may have gone so far that they committed "genocide" in Bucha.
We will do everything so that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished, Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as "provocation."
It made the claim without evidence that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made within minutes of the material appearing lends absolutely no doubt to who 'commissioned' this story, she said.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another provocation by the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the U.N. Security Council to meet April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Russian Investigative Committee released a statement announcing a "probe" into charges that Ukraine had spread "known false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the nation on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a "genocide" in the city and telling Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their troops had done.
I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented, Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
It's joint responsibility.
For the murders, for the torture... For the shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
When I see people with hands tied behind their backs and their heads cut off, I don't understand, he said of the scenes of carnage in the streets of Bucha, a town of about 35,000 people northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a correspondent for Radio Free Europe saw bodies in the streets of a small town that appeared to be civilian.
In one location, a correspondent saw up to 10 bodies in the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different locations in Buochi.
The bodies of one group of nine men - all civilians - were scattered in the ground close to where local people say Russian forces had been based.
Victims appear to have been killed at close range.
The Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area around Kiev, which was under the control of Russian troops last week.
Thank you, yes, we bought everything on the list.
They said: "Kiev is not there". How occupants transported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is another point in this list about which there is much less information so far - the eviction of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Starting from mid-March, the Russian occupants "evacuated" the Ukrainian population from the temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and to the territory of Belarus, which in fact was given to the Russian military polygon by the self-proclaimed president Luakshenko.
Ukrainian Truth found the expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the evacuation itself is going and whether there is a way to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed tovoluntary-forced evacuation beyond the borders of Ukraine under psychological pressure and hopelessness.
They are lucky and alive and keeping in touch with family.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, a large number of citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under duress.
In Melitopol, Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity home, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zatsepinsky, who was killed.
Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Hostomel months before the war.
Alexander himself got a job at the Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
As true platooners, Denis and Marina gathered their belongings, but they did not manage to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They didn't have their own car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone either.
At around 12pm on February 24 they saw V-shaped helicopters, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
The family then went down into the cellar and stayed there for three weeks until March 17, when the Russian soldiers took them to Belarus.
A total of around 40 people were hiding in the cellar.
Not everyone decided to go.
On the evening of February 24, people came to the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, "Who?" - I say so. - "Get out!"
They deceived me, interrogated me, asked who was in the cellar, whether there was a weapon.
All the men were questioned as to whether they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to defend you by the instruction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen OMON, even not the army, young men aged 25-35.
They said: "We helped the Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded a unit of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we lacked.
We say that water was a big problem with it.
They smashed the shop, stole goods from there under the pretext "either the Russians will take it anyway", and brought us six buckets.
There are videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
That's what they said after looting the shop: "We know it's wrong, but we really need the video for Ramzan Ahmadovich."
Nobody in particular wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child said: 'You've got seven days to give us your phones' - they grinned.
And they constantly distanced themselves from the Russians.
It's good that they came, as it was they who did not want war, and they are good people: "Putin is a bastard, as is Kadyrov, but we can do nothing, as our families are there".
And mainly they did not fight, but looted shops, marauded.
They tied the crow to one leg with a Georgian ribbon and to the other ‚Äì his white scarf ‚Äì and called it a ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù.
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I do not know how their reconnaissance worked out ... When they were beat up in Bucha, they did not even pick up the bodies, so they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had organized gangs ‚Äì Chechens did not know each other, and in the first days they asked for passwords to find out who was friend and who was foe.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk airborne troops.
They set up 30-40 units of technology between the houses ‚Äì we constantly stumbled upon it from the Bayraktars.
They came and told us that the Ukrainian army no longer exists, but there is "AZOV", and according to their words, "AZOV" is so numerous in Ukraine.
The narrative that "Kiev has surrendered" has been pushed since the beginning of March.
A Russian - either a commando officer or an FSB representative - said to us that there would be an evacuation.
We were listening to the radio - they were talking about Bucha, Hostomel, and we thought that maybe the "green corridor" would be given to us.
From the very beginning we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they say: "They will take you to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov".
We are saying we don't want this, we don't want that.
Their response was: "Then blame your children's psyches!"
How it worked: they lured us into the cellar and started shooting at us from under the house - either "Grad" or mortar rounds.
And then it came back... The neighboring houses simply burned, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor of our house.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of it didn't go, saying that this is for traitors of the motherland - allegedly, "they'll shoot you there and sell your organs".
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were burnt out cars and broken down machinery on both sides of the road, though the Belarussians claimed the Russians had immediately carted the machinery away.
Lots of caponiers, buried technology and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we underwent an improvised control, many people were without documents at all because they had burned them.
They accommodated us in the Red Cross tents, gave us tea.
We can hear the shots! A rocket is launching, and there's smoke ‚Äì it must have been an "Iskander" missile launched at Kiev.
But the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, the planes are flying and turning on the border."
But we in aviation, have education, understand that.
We then got on a bus and were taken to a sanatorium called "Chonki" near Gomel.
His boss, Vasyl Stepanovych Hunger, says: "Listen, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves are caught.
Poor people suffer!
And we have such a good Lukashenko!
He will do as he says".
Offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "But you are traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and the UN representation (at least that's what they were called) spread misinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed it and feared leaving Belarus.
However, we decided to go, although we had problems with documents - her daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were expecting it on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate they couldn't help us, and at the station in Minsk they said that without passports nobody would take us in the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and were accompanied.
They did not hold back in the sanatorium.
Our friend, a migration representative, said that you can stay here for up to a week and a half, as Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here at all.
We found an internal transfer who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving past Mozir (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles on Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, beautifully lights up, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozir said that Russians are constantly shooting from the polygon there.
I can say that Belarusians do not at all want to fight.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that her son's leg was broken if he was called.
Northern Belarus, where Minsk is, is generally not believed.
Say: "You are lying, we - peaceful people".
They do not believe that their polygons are used to shell Ukraine.
We were expecting friends in Poland who took us to Estonia.
We are now registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, certainly, as many as Estonian ones."
Marina lived in the territory of the military town of Gostomel together with the family of her brother - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
Early on February 24, she called her cousins and asked them to gather the necessary things and documents.
That evening they went to sleep in the cellar of the neighboring house.
She was not able to return home and, in principle, will not be able to - the house no longer exists.
No-one knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday in the center will not be able to?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are waiting for you always!
Thank you for the agreement, the flowers are beautiful.
And in this small apartment there is no wifi, mainly answering all your questions, but now I do not know how to be? And the children are online from Monday, but there is no internet.
So I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to take us in?
In the Quran it is written: "Even a leaf does not fall from the tree without its knowledge."
Our children learn online, I am a salesman and a cook, but I can work in politics and as a cleaner, in other words, a versatile worker. Maryana is a specialist in increasing war, she can work at home, and the second Maryana has no specialty, that is, a versatile worker.
Can we agree on how to do this better?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoliy Fedoruk reported a joyful news - Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian occupants on March 31.
The occupiers were expelled from the entire Kiev region the next day.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it became known at the same time that in just one town of Bucha, Russians had shot at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were killed just for being on the street, their hands were tied and they were shot in the back of the head, some of them minors.
The bodies of Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and their son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a common grave, Igor was in the sewer.
Bodies of several women, wrapped in blankets, were found near the track 20 km from Kiev.
Russians have been trying to burn them down.
And if I go then nobody will be at home
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.

They asked me to accompany my friend and his friends to the exhibition and help them get protection visas.

I often communicate with you in my mind. It seems to me that you can hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
This is what he said in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Presidential Office, writes European Truth.
All kit, all that they have sent already for some types of kit, for some it is too late.
So, when we talk, for example, about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, this is indeed so.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," he said.
Asked if Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "No, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have been different.
It would have been different, we would have had close neighbours, we could have fought together.
But I am confident that there would have been no war," he added.
We remind that the British Prime Minister has promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armor and anti-ship weapons.
I had a dream that the war ended and I returned home.

When prices soar by 100-200%.

We hide from my stepmother news about the war for a whole month.
So far, so good.
However, in Plyamki (kitten - UP) the fur around the tail and on the hind legs has become matted - this may be due to stress, a change in diet and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but unfortunately stress from me does not depend on me.
A spark, unlike a detonation, does not go deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions."
As Olga is almost deaf and spends most of her time in her room, her niece lived with her "incognito" in the apartment for months.

For 33 days I lived with her in an apartment as a partisan.
They were hiding from war and the fact that I was there - formally I arrived as always for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always by the bed.
Most of the time the widow spends in her room.
I looked bad - it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "hooves", I hid in my room.
First of all it hides from it the receiver and the TV.
Then she called everyone she was in contact with, six or seven people.
Asked her to speak about anything, just not about the war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end

A British man who fought in the ranks of the Ukrainian army to defend Mariupol says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British soldier serving with the Ukrainian Marine Brigade, which is fighting to defend Mariupol, told his friends and family that they should lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: the Twitter page of Aiden Aslin, a British volunteer who had served in the ranks of the Ukrainian army since 2018, the BBC with reference to Aslin's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of his friend, who spoke to him.
According to Twitter, Esin said: "We received a message from him: "We have been trying everything for 48 days to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice left but to surrender to the Russian army.
We still have food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon be over."
Details: Asein served in the 36th Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, which is taking part in the defense operation in Mariupol.
Journalists from the BBC contacted Lance Corporal Wood's mother, who confirmed her son had called her to say they were planning to surrender.
Philips, a friend of military man Brennan, also confirmed to journalists that in their last telephone conversation Assange had spoken to him about the plans of his unit to surrender.
According to him, the brigade has run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News agency contacted his friend who said that the Aisin unit intended to surrender to the Russian units rather than fall unarmed into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovtsy" units.
A audio recording of a phone call purportedly between Assange and an American friend who was planning to travel to Ukraine was also circulating on social media.
In the conversation Estin said they had tried to leave the city in civilian clothes but were unable to.
Earlier, the Briton said that representatives of the private military company Wagner had threatened him on Instagram.
Essa was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but from 2015 to 2017 he went to fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the Ukrainian army and took the oath.
His friends and close ones called him Johnny, while in social networks he was better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

Bolshevik attackers had revenged themselves in full for their losses in the battle.
Teacher Dmitry Pavlichenko, his unknown relative and teenager Boris Alexienko were shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit, which was filled with earth."
According to his recollections, "there was some kind of dead silence in the city".
Every now and again, someone from among the residents would walk from house to house.
Bodies of the battered Bolsheviks could always be found in the streets

Very interesting tradition, we do something similar at Christmas
Last week the Verkhovna Rada passed bill 7176, known as "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere."
Interestingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere has turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in virtual Kiev may somehow solve the problem of national security in Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new hazards for state companies, but so far we do not know about any company where it was necessary to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of its location.
The potential threat of such a law - this is the basis for "removing" all achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
Like that until 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should be on them?
And more - if under the patriotic slogans "flies" one harmful bill, then tomorrow others can fly - for example, the system of state purchases through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be put down to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the war and the 7176 bill.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
The desire to get rid of the monitoring councils in one way or another has long been circulating among some people's deputies.
Not for criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, let's examine the arguments presented in favor of its adoption.
And then we will present our proposals on how to manage state-owned enterprises during the war.
Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make remote monitoring of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board may not be able to take the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the work of the company.
We agree that such a risk exists, but is it possible to prevent members of supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation where independent members of the supervisory board (who make up the majority of the composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And that will lead to the loss of a quorum needed for the watchdog to approve any decisions.
Instead, it will be impossible to quickly appoint new independent members to the supervisory board, as the law provides for the necessity of conducting a competitive selection process, which takes an average of 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed law project 7176 will inevitably lead to the loss of the possibility of making decisions by the supervisory board, rather than the opposite!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
He notes, in particular, that "many companies, especially the defense-industrial complex (OPK), now require relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that people can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom from Vienna."
At the beginning, there were practically no state enterprises of the OPK in Ukraine that had supervisory boards.
The supervisory board is only in "Ukroboronprom", which in fact manages almost all state enterprises of the OPK.
However, even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the law, the supervisory council has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a voluntary basis.
All the power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the general director, who will also make decisions on the necessity of relocating one or another enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the holding.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism because the bill No. 7176 does not introduce any changes to the legislation that regulates the activities of state-owned enterprises in the field of defense.
Pan Dmitry also presented arguments on his Facebook page that could be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state companies and banks, but let's try to decipher some of them: "respected foreign experts leave Ukraine at the first mention of the word 'war' in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of tens of thousands of hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
Firstly, this is manipulation - the majority of such members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally come here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine", in the soft sense, is unfair.
In addition, as a result of the pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been accustomed to holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in global practice, in absolutely different fields: business, education, medicine, and so on.
It should also be remembered that being a member of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have another occupation and the means of electronic communication helps them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements read as claims exclusively directed at foreigners.
Interesting, why does Mr. Dmitry not express identical claims to members of the supervisory boards, who are Ukrainians?
For they do not know where their companies are located either.
As for the sentence, it is far from the first populist attempt by MPs to kick out foreigners from monitoring councils, and the war - it is just a new convenient opportunity.

Strengthened curfew for 2 days will be introduced in Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupants.
The direct words of Pavlyuk: "In populated areas of the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian forces, the curfew is strengthened!
The restrictions will be in place in the territories of these towns and villages from 9 p.m. on April 2 to 6 a.m. on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the regional VA, at present it is absolutely forbidden to be in the streets of populated areas and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents will only be able to leave their homes during a alert signal in order to take cover.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean up and demine territories.
Omelianuk urged people who had left the areas so far to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.

For several years in a row, the Serbian defense budget has been growing at a geometric progression.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested over 200 million euros in modernizing the army, updating military technology and purchasing modern systems, rising to 22nd place among the world's strongest military powers.
After the full-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine, Western countries quite seriously took into account the forecast of the possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Lukashenko's authorities detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling device near Ossipovichi, ensuring the movement of railway trains.
Source: Radio Liberty, human rights center "Vesna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency BelTA.
It was reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus that three residents of Bobruisk were detained and one was injured during a special operation "Sobr" in the night of March 30 with the use of force.
According to "Vyasna", the men resisted arrest and attempted to flee.
Security forces used their weapons.
One of the detained men received a wound and is in a medical institution.
Others were given first aid at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich stated that "the acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be stopped" by the police using weapons.
It became known on April 6 that on March 30 the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, the employee of the Baranovichi branch "BZD" and the administrator of thematic resources "BZD" in "Contact" and "Classmates" Valentin Samasyuk.
His whereabouts and condition are unknown, @belzhd_live reported.
At the end of March in Belarus not less than 40 railwaymen were detained for diversions.
Recall that the formation of BYpol, which was declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on objects of railway transport and infrastructure within the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "railway partisans" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
As is known, through Belarus, Russia sends forces to fight in Ukraine.

US bans investment in Russia, imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, along with G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against Russian President Putin's daughters, major Russian banks Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, while Alfa Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any assets they have in the U.S. financial system and prohibit Americans from doing business with them.
In addition, the USA will introduce a full ban on new investments in Russia.
With this goal, US President Joe Biden signed a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
The move follows a decision by more than 600 transnational companies to exit Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States were limitations on major Russian state companies in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit US citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list will be published by the Ministry on Thursday.
The final part of the package involves blocking the assets of adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-president and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

Realized about dad
Undoubtedly, I am very naive or very in love, but I will think of something to do with this money.
We can do this somehow.
How it will be paid for, please, no credits.
Write to me directly and I will help.
You are my partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't even know.
What clothes did they give you?
Not my day today. The blinds in the living room broke this morning. Another one this evening.
If something came to you, I don't see
It also makes me very sad.
I'll get back to you on that later
Is it only your dad who speaks and understands Russian?
On which day does the colleague want to clean the house and how many houses have windows?
I am ashamed to distract you from your affairs
Good evening, I can't not share with you. There's news from Mariupol about my son - he's alive and in the army.
Raju is reading Joe Dispenza, he is scientifically studying the impact of external factors and the formation of new neural connections
Journalist Natalia Nagornya of the "1+1" TV channel published a video recording on April 12 morning, which was sent to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
The military said there were no weapons left to fight with and many casualties.
They said the "bill is by the hour."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and Ukrainian military commanders have not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluznyi said that the connection with the forces of defense in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters at the "A–∑–æ–≤—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å" plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupants dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azov, Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons near the "A–∑–æ–≤stal" factory, which is held by the Azov battalion.
Thank you, I will try to accommodate to you. That would be very good
The situation, as it is, we will stay here

A trivial matter

The Czechüá®üáø drone squadron began flights over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional helicoptersüöÅ will be used to detect them, and some of them - to destroy the enemy directlyüí•.
Two Carpathian and two Czech 'pigeon' brothers are sending their birds to Ukraine tomorrow thanks to Delegate of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenk.
Today, however, their intermountain friends, headed by the leader of the rural council and coordinator Vasily Shchurom, delivered the drones on target: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where fighting is still ongoing.
With the aim of using helicopters in a maximally effective and safe way ‚Äì the location of their deployment will remain a secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic say that they do not plan to stop and that they will send many interesting "gifts" to Ukraine in the coming days, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Did not hesitate, all good. I love sweets, but can do without it
I am worried that we will not make it. A lot of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine, continue to work.
Good. If everything goes well, I agree
I will try myself, but if there are any problems, I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were at the mayor's house in Yivov, she saw that I was pregnant but said there was no housing.
Perhaps she will be glad and her mood will improve
My phone was repaired today.
I think my feet are frozen now
Drank the medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critically.
I am sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'll be healthy.
Whenever you have time, send me music that you like.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?
Mom and dad need to listen
You will find it somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It was colder and raining today, but it will be warm tomorrow.
It is not the houses that are destroyed, it is the people, upon whom the occupiers trample
In Kherson, the occupants desecrated the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial on Prekopskaya Street in Kherson.
Details: It was noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, damaged a panel with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore down the portraits of the Heavenly Hundred heroes and the killed participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was lowered.
Good morning, thank you for the carol, we do not have such a tradition, so we did not know, we gave the children chocolate and pastries, possibly something else was needed to be given

Hello a bit better.
It was in the pasture today.
He even slept there today.
That's great progress for us.
I definitely have to bring vareniki another time!
Today I do not have the strength to do it.
As I push away from days and times when there is work to be done on cleaning the apartment after guests, I can approximately say that in April I will have an approximate graph of cleaning the apartment.
In May - I can say approximately at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
Just wondering if you have heard anything about it.
Hello, excuse me, I haven't written for a long time and I fell asleep.
If you're not against it, I could come today?)
Or we can meet after your arrival)
He is modest, and has been studying a lot lately. Understood that this is very important for him in life.
(Hello) everything went very well.
I was a bit shocked to work with people in such high positions.
Today we had a lesson with a lady who is the head of the department of economy in the mountainous region.
She was very satisfied with my work.

And now a quick question for you
If you need help writing
If I am not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning we didn't want you to collect money in order for people not to think that we are speculating on this!
However, for online completion, there were not enough points for me.
I'm going to rest now. Gathering strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Goodbye

Staff statement: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transdniestria in order to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army could provoke incidents in the Pridnestrovian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the Russian Federation's armed forces will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against its neighboring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create an attacking grouping of troops for action in the direction of the Sloboda.
It is likely that in the nearest days occupants will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weaponry and military technology are being prepared at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motor rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the East Military District.
It is likely that this equipment will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Recruitment is also underway among the ranks of the battalion tactical group of the 36th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th Army of the Eastern Military District for the restoration of losses in the personnel structure.
The enemy feels a particular problem when it comes to staffing drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The withdrawal of the personnel from the permanent location point is planned for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy will continue to strike transportation infrastructure objects on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the areas of combat operations.
Specific units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
Some units from the 6th Army and the Northern Fleet's coastal troops are continuing a partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv and are shelling some areas of the city.
Aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in the direction of Izium to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the "Orlan-10" UAV.
Enemy forces, numbering up to two battalions, attempted to advance in the direction of the populated areas of Dovheyne and Dmitrivka, without success, and retreated to previously held positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy's main efforts continue to focus on taking control of the populated areas of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhny and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out a storming operation in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Golden, but did not succeed.
In the city of Mariupol, occupiers are continuing assault operations in the areas of the "A–∑–æ–≤stal" factory and the marine port using artillery and aviation.
The enemy used artillery fire to attack the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of populated settlements of Vysokopillia, Trudolubivka and Marianske.
In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions over the past day, Ukraine's defenders repelled four attacks by the enemy, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six units of motor transport and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try, but I doubt
If you want to sleep, go to bed, and I'll keep you here.
You don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, and I will understand)
Thank you. We at home did not watch TV and especially not 1+1. We did not need to adjust anything)
I include the TV here just to listen to the Czech language
My monthly package of tariffs ends today :).
Can we do this over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand, then I can prepare the material in this field.
I ask her. I am a bit ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We will meet later with my father, for sure üôèüèª
I read a post on Facebook, so maybe Google wrote something on their own. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, the things you brought are taken, but are there things that our little ones can bring to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the boss agrees, I can start working next week. Tomorrow I plan to go to the employment office to submit documents (if possible, because the queues are very long) and on Saturday it will rain.
I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry in school, I study Czech language to know it perfectly, my dream is to work at Tesla.
Old friends and not very close ones, friends I don't know personally, friends by spirit and mind.
Now it's your turn to face difficult times.
Over the past month I have been in contact with many of you.
Your life, which was already never easy, turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
A lot of you are running away from Russia.
Many of you acknowledged that you feel guilty and ashamed of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
For what you are doing to Ukraine in your name.
Some of you, activists, have long been under threat and you were preparing for the decisive blow.
At the beginning of March I wrote Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
Let's go there now, - as usually, Sasha replied laconically. - Now, after the search, we are walking around the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are stunned by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, and most of you hate them.
Let's be honest: apart from a very few of you - those who worked for 'Memorial', 'Novaya Gazeta', 'Echo of Moscow', 'Meduza', Navalny's organization and a number of other places, how many of you have done at least something to oppose this regime?
Apart from attending meetings when they were still happening.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to be silent"
And if so, are you confident that your feelings of shame and guilt - are not just abstractions?
Perhaps they are prompted by your sustained indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive participation, which now, undoubtedly, weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
It was not always like that.
There was a short period in the 1990s when you had freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not better than 1917.
Every time there is a revolution, when it finally happens to you, you are finally overcome by such a strong fear of chaos that you seek salvation behind the king, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
However many people he kills, to you it seems safer to be near him. Why is this?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publicizing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Gestapo, you went to the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to survive, update itself, reform and take control of the country.
When faced with the choice between looting the country and returning communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted looting.
Your economy collapsed in 1998, marking the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Staying alive was the main concern.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and revive the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it or gave preference to not voting at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya with the ground, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and saw the ruins of Grozny, Katyr-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other towns with my own eyes.
Sometimes on weekends I would return to Moscow and have fun with you, my friends.
We drank, danced and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about children killed, about soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me "Brade, we are tired of your Chechnya". I remember these words very well.
In response, I said "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, it is your Chechnya.
It's your country, not mine.
I am just a silly foreigner.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too hard, too painful, and you didn't want to know.
Then came the economic upswing of the zeroes, fuelled by soaring oil prices and Mr Putin's readiness to look the other way as some of the stolen money found its way into the wallets of the middle class.
Many of you are doing well, some are getting rich, and even the poorest among you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Flowers wilt, is it not a misfortune?
Moscow shone and sparkled like a diamond.
When several opposition activists - Yury Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - were killed, many were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the case did not proceed.
When Putin moved from the presidency to the premiership after two terms, you barely noticed - as I see it.
When after months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you did I meet in the next years on the mountain slopes of Gudauti, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I recognize that we in the West have done little if anything.
A bit of indignation, a bit of sanctions; but what is the meaning of that, when Russia flagrantly violates international law, when such great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?
Life in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, this was the main thing.
But at the end of 2011, my Russian friends, you finally woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidential seat, as before, many of you decided that this was too much and you massively came out on protest.
Navalny's name became familiar, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing the ground under its feet.
He then delivered a blow in return.
First there were alternative actions, then more repressive laws were passed and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some got huge terms.
What could we do?
I heard it so often myself and still do.
The state is so strong and we are so weak.
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Outraged by a pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European hopes, they seized the Maidan - and never left.
They built a tent city completely on their own and were preparing for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they started to defend themselves with sticks, armature and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, protesters attacked.
Many died, but they prevailed.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and the Ukrainians returned to themselves democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and remove them if they do not fulfill their duties.
Putin did not like the square at all.
This was a bad example.
Taking advantage of the general chaos, he seized Crimea.
A few were against it, but the benefits have been few.
How many of you were smitten!
As far as I know, 91% of the citizens of Russia supported the annexation.
Where did this new myth come from, and how many of you who despised Putin and his clique suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I cannot think of a reason because we stopped communicating immediately afterwards.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly kept quiet.
We are not interested in politics, - you say.
You new hide in books, movies, catalogs of IKEA and parks, just like new after restoration, which the Moscow mayor began in 2012 - with their binoculars, a public toilet and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it becomes only better.
You've barely looked at Syria.
Were there terrorists, though?
IDIL what is that... Even a Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it then in an interview, because I supposedly knew nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw with my own eyes how state snipers cold-bloodedly shot at my children in the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who began bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemoller:
They came for the socialists first, but I kept quiet - because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to speak up for me."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really do speak now - as, for example, Dmitry Gluhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from beyond the border, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina O–≤—Å—è–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞, risking ending up in a new GULAG or keeping company with Navalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
I am confident you understand: when Mr Putin falls out with the Ukrainians - or, to put it mildly, if he doesn't get his way - he will come after you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who were brave, but mostly alone, who went out on protests and are still facing minor terms, but soon will face serious ones.
Thousands of you who signed the petition, who expressed dissent on social media (even if it was just a black square on Instagram) or spoke out privately to colleagues at work.
Those days when 10 or 25 years in prison were laughed off for an anecdote are long gone - and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will stay?
The example of the Ukrainians - even more so than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight against it.
What intelligence, motivation and courage could stop him, however daunting it may seem on paper.
Considering everything, few in Russia realize this as well as that the war goes on in general.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
Putin knows that you know.
So be ready.
Do you understand what it all means.
A good life was exchanged for your silence.
Your elections - it's just a joke, your laws are only worth the paper they are written on, there are no independent media left in Ukraine, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you have no credit cards left to buy a plane ticket to leave the country, even if there are still some flights.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement, your submissiveness.
If you don't give him what he wants, you can try to go away or get rid of him.
I doubt you will see another version.
Well, there's still one.
Will ultimately bring down this regime.
It may be, in the circumstances, that less of you than you think will be required.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: through the economic collapse looming over Russia, it will most likely flicker in the provinces, in small towns.
When the prices rise and the wages are not paid, people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace, will go out into the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, my friends.
But if each city comes out on its own for protests, like it has periodically happened, it will be easy for it to quash them one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. It will be necessary to transform the crowd into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and which can be set up under any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was broken up, but it is possible to create others, more informal, more decentralized.
You are very many, you are millions.
Moscow police will be able to cope with up to 30,000 people in the streets, possibly up to 100,000.
If more than 300,000 come out, she will be shocked.
It will be necessary to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin, when it comes to the matter?
After all, what he made them do in Ukraine, all of it, because of what he made them go through?
Of course it will be very dangerous.
Many will feel understandable fear; those with children will fear for them.
It's natural, it's normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their masters, who not only demand freedom, but really strive to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game - and be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a Syrian cell under police batons.
And this has been going on for a long time - and will continue to do so, becoming more and more widespread.
So this is what you want? If you don't do anything, you know how this is going to end.
Act coolly, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday when we were told we could come in on Monday
We'll be home by evening
What do you think of me as a press secretary
Wico, how often do you go to expensive restaurants for dinner?
Once in a while I go out for dinner in an expensive restaurant.
I will try to explain it to her)
So we liked it very much and we wanted to do something about it and this was the best option.
She was in a room with a lot of people. She was energetically tired.
I feel bad, coughing, temperature, loss of voice, weakness and headache.
I must go to that hard work
We have already done it, but said who registered in April will receive the money only at the end of the month.
We need to get a pass on Thursday so we can take the children to the doctor.
But one night one lady wrote to me, who liked your work and she wanted to give you something at her house.
I am waiting for new news from her and will inform for sure.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
A great shame about the lost time, but it's a life experience.
I am communicative in personal life, but frivolous when it comes to questions about marriage.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died of a heart attack.
I believe that in order to create a family, people must love, respect, and trust each other.
I haven't come across that yet.
Good day. Where in Yegoryevsk can I buy forms for baking pies (paper or silicone)?
Good, thank you for the advice, I will now submit the certificate as evidence in the questionnaire.
She is in a coma, she now has a broken collarbone in plaster, the wheelchair is in the lying down position, edema all over her body
Mr Reihard, excuse me for disturbing you in your free time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natali's game room today to say hi to her.
She found herself in a difficult situation.
But when the children went home, one mother refused to take her child because she said she had come to look at the things and put them in that room with the clothes and Mr Valery opened our children's room to her until 7 p.m.
Could it be true?
The working time of the room is until 4 p.m.
And, after all, it is our responsibility.
But not loading does not open the page very weak internet
Good day, all is well) Kolya is working, yesterday we filled out invitations, and I was dealing with seniors before the exam in the gym.
The most important thing is to understand the geometry.
On Saturday Vladimir helped us.
Vika studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and utilities?
We are very grateful for the house.
But I thought you didn't fill it in.
We will try to collect the maximum amount by the end of the week in order to settle the debt
The situation regarding the Russian invasion ‚Äì a briefing by the adviser to the head of the Presidential Office Alexei Areshkov (April 10, 2022)
The adviser to the president's office told of a heroic act by an officer of the elite forces in Mariupol - he was surrounded and injured, so he blew himself up with a radio station so that it would not fall into the hands of the enemy.
This is a very important question for me, whether you will help me count my granddaughter, who is 5 years old (bronchial asthma), now she has a runny nose and coughs...
We need a family doctor for her who speaks a little Ukrainian or Russian.
Immediate consultation with a doctor is very worrying for her condition.
We live in Czech Dolni Chabry. We need a doctor who is located here in Dolni Chabry or somewhere nearby, possibly in Brno but not far from the metro, so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was very popular.
The spiders crawled on the children's hands and feet.
How are you?
Oh my goodness, what a cute kid! I am so grateful, I don't even have words. Thank you so much. God bless you.
Mom stands there from 4 a.m.
Perhaps the mistress will leave her phone for communication.
So far, the best option seems to me this house in Prague 8.
The director did not say anything to me about the possibility of sponsorship payment for the child's meals.
Give me such data for payment.
I paid for food for part of March and all of April.
Would it be possible for you to help me pay for May and June?
What do I need to do?
Ask the headteacher about this?
Is it better to go on Mondays or come on Wednesdays?!,
All your friends will know that you are talking to me
I do not know what to do, whether to wait for housing or not

I need an umbrella. I can pay for the rental.
