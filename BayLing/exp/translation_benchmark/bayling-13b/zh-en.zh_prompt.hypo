Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent such things from happening again.

At the annual meeting of Tsinghua University, students sang and the research results were impressive.
Use air to wash hands, detect bad breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately search for the source of haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of outstanding academic achievements were applauded.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, etc. From a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards domestically and internationally.
Bio-sensor: Your family doctor at home
The Ph.D. students from the Biomedical Engineering Institute Zhang Dingming team displayed a biological sensor the size of a smartphone.
With just a breath, this device can detect your health status from the components of the gas you exhale.
张迪鸣介绍说，这套传感器与智能手机相连，呼出气体后，健康报告就会显示在手机上。
Smart rings that can detect health status in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses a new material called石墨烯. Its target is chemical elements. The sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.
Smart surgical light: doctor's high-powered eyes.
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lamps have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Invention Fair in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The master's students of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, Zhu Linjun and Shen Jingfeng, from the team, invented a smart LED surgical light that avoids the defects of traditional surgical lights.
Many early detection and removal of diseases are related to the operating room lights used by doctors.
Jian-Feng said that if the doctor cannot timely clarify all tumor organizations at the early detection of cancer, then cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical light has four light plates that enhance the contrast of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the light according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been tried and tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, and has received positive feedback.
In October last year, this invention won first prize in the national challenge cup.
Use air to wash your hands: cool and trendy.
An ordinary person washes their hands by pouring water and scrubbing with soap, while Li Keqiang and his colleagues invented an “air hand washing device”.
As long as we stand on the handwashing station, our weight can compress the air out of it.
Like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water faucet and mixes with water.
"That way, we can wash our hands clean!"
The results of the color reaction and bacterial retention experiments prove that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of regular handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure cleanliness and save 90% of water, and the entire process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out from many top universities around the world and won the only gold award.

Good, thank you.
A meaningful certificate - a first aid certificate.
This is one of the most important skill certificates I have obtained apart from my driver's license!
Publicize: In fact, first aid measures are emergency rescue when sudden events occur, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, the time it takes for an ambulance to arrive after an accident is actually a matter of crucial importance.
This is an emergency.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke and stopped breathing, our window of life would be only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, people around me know how important first aid is!
When someone falls around us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing, which is so horrifying.
In China, our official data shows that 3 million people die from sudden cardiac arrest every year.
Across the country, an average of 15% are saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, about 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1% can be saved."
This is the first reaction founder Lu Lei said.
If someone has a heart attack, stops breathing, and their heart stops beating, punching them will do absolutely nothing.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person's life.
I found that few people nowadays have this awareness to learn first aid, but when accidents happen, they are inadequate. Therefore, I urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond timely when facing emergencies.
You never know, it might just save someone's life!
You can register for the emergency certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students can enjoy a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25. Adding the emergency medical certificate to the goal list is also a thing a few months ago, but it is indeed completed!
After that, I want to apply for other certificates. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving emergency certificate on Weibo before, and it seems that I can only take the diving certificate if I have an emergency certificate. Therefore, the emergency certificate is really useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
One of the dumplings cost 13 yuan!?

How can #NAME# not understand?
How much is it?
Yesterday, PRS ORG delivered food, and this time they gave me a dumpling!?
Because before I input the code, I saw that it was effective.
First, the conclusion. Personally, I think "The Four Seas" is a comprehensive work in all senses.
But you have to admit, this movie is not just a highlight, the soundtrack is pretty good too.
Melodramas are a dime a dozen, one that can lull you to sleep in the cinema and one that can make you furious after watching, “The Four Seasons” is like a monkey on Mount Tai, it can set your anger alight in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly outstanding.
The most painful thing about this piece is that it seems to be a creature in a Kafkaesque novel, indescribable and with many loopholes, just like the windbreaker on the body of the little horse.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a director's hidden metaphor, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is just a pile of excrement.
First, let me explain some plot points that I found confusing.
The male protagonist should reside on a small island to the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, so the plot arranges for a kind old man in the neighborhood to take her to see snow in Northeast China.
An elderly person is sitting on a bread cart traveling from the south to the north to see snow?
Neither he nor his father are at all worried about it.
And then this old man just lost his train of thought.
How did the couple obtain the business license to operate the hotel on the abandoned boat?
Why did the helicopter party on the island easily block a mountain road?
The truck that was carrying steel rods in the middle of the road stopped, and the truck drivers around it could not find it.
This feeling is too obvious.
Why would an untrustworthy and illegal small drone party become a police assistant?
Why didn't he report the high interest loan? The police in the movie even asked if he was in trouble.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a hotel room key card and then insists on finding the hotel manager to sleep outside the room?
This inexplicable plot permeates throughout the entire film, causing me to feel pain every time I recall them.
Apart from the plot, the worst thing about the movie is that it has no purpose, or rather it is a patchwork of nonsense.
At the beginning of the film, you would think it was a comedy, 20 minutes later, it could be a motivational film. After watching half of it, you would think it was a film that depicted the struggles of young people living in a small town. After watching it all, you still wouldn't know what you had watched, followed by deep self-doubt and the question of why you ran to the cinema to watch toilets when you were much older.
For most people, in fact, it is quite familiar with the plot of various movies. For example, if you want to become a race car driver, you can encourage yourself + comedy and then tell the audience how an ordinary cook can become a successful chef step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should talk about the hatred and reconciliation between the young man who loves to ride motorcycles in the small town and the waitress sisters.
If you want to reflect reality, the thing your plot cannot have is something that contradicts with the normal world.
"(For example, the new mortal character played by Yin just got burned, yet he can still sing,) so I cannot bear to watch some brain-dead movies."
As for the female lead who is not weak-willed, she sometimes acts like a 5-year-old, and I don't know if it's because of her acting or the director's request.
There is one thing I don't quite understand. As a race car driver, why is Han Han so enthusiastic about adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Was this movie schedule arranged during the Spring Festival in order to cater to the audience?

Chongqing Vocational College of Technology pilot modern apprenticeship program: Enrolling students are directly employed by enterprises and become qualified workers-China News Service
Yesterday, reporters learned from the municipal education committee that starting this year, our city will pilot the “modern apprentice” talent training mode in 60 vocational schools. Students who participate in the pilot will be apprenticing while studying and will be enrolled as unit staff when they are admitted.
The municipal education committee requires the standardization of recruitment and employment procedures for vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identity of vocational school students and qualified employees, and based on the principle of mutual selection, the students, schools, and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, and for students under 18 years old, a quadripartite agreement must be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for students during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and collaborate with enterprises to carry out pre-employment and conversion training for employees.
The experimental school wants to reform the mode of talent training.
Jointly design a talent training plan with the school, formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, position standards, enterprise tutor standards, quality monitoring standards and relevant implementation plans.
The pilot program aims to cultivate the educational system. Students determine their internship time in enterprises according to the plan of cultivating talents. The on-the-job training generally lasts for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one teacher can lead 2 to 5 students to form a learning group, ensuring that students are familiar with the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city divided into three batches a total of 60 city-level modern apprentices, with a total of 3000 students (apprentices).
"Pilot first, then promote according to the principle of step-by-step advancement. Explore establishing a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integration of talent, in order to effectively improve students' employment skills and increase students' employment rate and quality."

South African doctor: Oomycete spread is strong but mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the spread rate is faster.
According to the Associated Press, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are mild, similar to those of the flu, such as body aches and coughing.
The organization's medical chief, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he was seeing dozens of patients each day without any need for hospitalization.
They are able to control the illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation, Plia said.
He said this includes the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, who are more prone to severe illness from the virus.
He said in comparison to the first wave of the Delta fever, the new coronavirus patients he treated "have difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are hospitalized within days.
Within two weeks of the initial report of the outbreak of cholera in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, among the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the first wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent coronavirus patients, only 3% died, while in the early cases in South Africa, the mortality rate reached 20%.
According to Willem Hanekom, the director of the African Health Research Institute, data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports indicate that "almost all indications point to this being a mild disease."
He also said, "It's still early now, we need to get the follow-up data."
"Usually, hospitalization and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this epidemic for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, and testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the primary strain of the virus worldwide, cases of the disease are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter.
According to health officials, a new case of the disease was discovered in the first week of December, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were the Omsk variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Educational evaluation: What do we rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare it to the famous public interest advertising slogan "Without buying and selling, there can be no killing," in an environment where there is no demand for "receiving and handing over," mass prevention and control, and universal opposition to trafficking make the trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, so such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the criminal investigation bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched a missing children emergency response platform.
This is an authorized channel for issuing notices of missing children and for promptly recovering abducted children, as well as an internet information platform established for this purpose.
I heard that this app is called "Together" and it feels very warm.
The new technology means not only "artistic" and "emotional", but also informatized and practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect their physical safety and freedom.
Secondly, there is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed with many "big words", ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the case is solved, the personal safety of the victim should be the top priority.
Some things are more urgent than others. In the midst of urgent "rescue" efforts, controversial topics such as whether "selling children should be a capital offense" can be temporarily shelved and carefully discussed; but helping children who have been abducted should not be neglected.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after committing the crime.
The longer the search takes, the further away the child may be from the parent, and the more difficult it will be to solve the case.
In this situation, taking out a direct and effective measure like "B��圆" platform is indeed a practical action that can help solve the case and find the missing children.
After all, "changing course" is a major task that requires the entire legal system to operate effectively.
Combating crime, protecting the rights of children and parents, from improving legislation to safeguarding justice and law enforcement, all require the implementation of "care for the young and weak".
In addition, preventing child trafficking, from families to society, can be further improved.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the train station, and when the parents wake up, they discover that their child is missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of young children, we should at least have some awareness of protection.
The best way to prevent children from being abducted is for both parents to take turns resting while the child is placed in a safe and secure environment.
From another perspective of the police cracking down on child trafficking, those who purchase trafficked children should also be monitored and punished.
A single act of illegality is often just a link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the maximum sentence for trafficking children is 5 years' imprisonment. In cases where the circumstances are particularly serious, the sentence may be up to life imprisonment and confiscation of property.
The crime of trafficking children is clearly a crime of heavier punishment in the trend of "lightening punishment".
To this day, there are still many cases of trafficking that occur every year.
It can be seen that some people's views on raising children are lagging behind, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this group of people should be synchronized.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, we cannot rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If "markets" are widespread, sellers will be greedy and constantly innovate in their selling methods, leading to a "cat-and-mouse" situation with law enforcers and making it inevitable that the crackdown will be inefficient.
Therefore, eradicating outdated concepts, promoting legal consciousness, also helps to eliminate trafficking and buying of children.
Yang Jiechi delivers a speech on the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the 6th CPC Provincial Congress
and draw on the strength of its hundred-year struggle.
December 10 news on Hunan Daily (Reporter: Fang Bo) According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Minister Yang Hongdao went to the video park in Maonanshan to deliver an interactive lecture, in-depth study and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and study and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Congress.
Yang Jiechi, from the ideal and belief, the initial mission, the self-revolution and the youthfulness of the Communist Youth League, the leaders and the theories of the Party, combined his own realization and his personal experience, and explained comprehensively and systematically the core essence and the practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress.
He pointed out that we should integrate the spirit of the 1st National Congress of the CPC and the important instructions given by General Secretary Xi Jinping during his important speech in Lake Dongting into the study and practice of the Provincial Party Committee, so as to strengthen the thought of “upholding the two safeguards” and “carrying out the two safeguards” and enhance self-consciousness, political consciousness and sense of responsibility, and unswervingly move forward in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive communication segment, grassroots party representatives, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives raised questions on the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of “two establishments”, how cultural enterprises can grasp the orientation, how young people in the new era can draw strength from the history of the Communist Youth League, and so on. Yang Jiechi answered the questions in a plain-spoken language and with vivid examples. He advised young party members to draw strength from the history of the party’s struggle, unite closely around the Party Central Committee, and unswervingly follow the Party. They should use their youthful enthusiasm to write

In fact, it's not the shop's mistake, it's the courier's mistake.
There is no invoice in the bag.
Investigation failed.
I hope you understand
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than the display.
No, thank you.
Yes, we already have a rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has always been processing.
After a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two categories and five grades: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil.
Cold-pressed olive oil, also known as extra virgin olive oil, is obtained from fresh olives by mechanical extraction and filtering to remove impurities.
There are three levels based on acidity:
"Extra Virgin Olive Oil" is the highest quality and quantity of olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a gentle and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
"High-quality extra virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste."
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin): Taste and aroma are still present, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
"Refined olive oil refers to olive oil that is obtained after the initial pressing of olive oil with a acidity level exceeding 3.3%, or it is called "second oil".
Olive oil can be divided into two levels:
"Refined olive oil (Olive Oil): a blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of freshly pressed olive oil, mixed to adjust the flavor and color, with an acidity of 1.5% or less, and a transparent light yellow color."
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: is obtained by extracting and refining oil from the olive pomace.
If you have watched the classification, you should have already discovered that the acidity of olive oil is an extremely important indicator.
You should know that olive oil is like wine made from grapes, and olive oil from different production areas and different olive varieties will produce oil of different standards.
The best place for olive trees to grow is:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climate conditions for olive trees to grow, including soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and rainfall.
Apart from the Mediterranean coastline, other areas can only be planted with zero stars.
主要产区产地（地中海）
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and other countries with similar climates are also found in the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
The olive harvesting season:
The time from 3 to 6 June every year is when olive trees bloom and fruit, and from 7 to 10 October the fruit begins to develop and ripen, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The period from November to the following February is the real harvest season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
The nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, including oleic acid and palmitoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Summit for Democracy" concluded on Friday (December 10th) with the participation of leaders from 110 countries, government officials, civil society and private sector leaders called by US President Biden.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in every person's heart, and authoritarian regimes will never extinguish it.
He also said that plans are underway to hold the second global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative, political affairs committee member Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy activist Roy Cheung, who is now in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work is that lies before us."
But we also know that we can face challenges, as I have said before, because democracy is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world and in every corner of the world.
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
"As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and resist the forces of authoritarianism and attacks, as well as those who want to selfishly pursue power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are respectively defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is just perfect for "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that the democratic cause is facing challenges, especially those brought by new digital technologies.
"It is time now to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as our democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality issues, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy activist Ronny Tong delivered a pre-recorded video message to the summit, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities such as the Uygurs and Tibetans in China.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been accepting China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must collaborate.
"Our top priority is to use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy."
Ron DeSantis also called for the free world to unite in countering the threat of communism.
"Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat of (the Communist Party) to our democratic values."
And that's why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Secretary-General Tang Feng attended the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Upholding Democratic Values" and released the "National Statement" through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
"At a time when democracy in Taiwan is in its infancy, we will always stand at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world, in the name of public health and collective interest, have rationalized human rights violations, which is a sign of global democracy in retreat.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to isolate ourselves to control the epidemic, nor do we need to stop all activities to combat false information.
"At the same time as the schedule for the 'Democracy Summit', the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and several other countries that have been recognized as having seriously violated human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been recognized as having used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights."

I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why delivery times are constantly being pushed back.
It turns out that we need #NUMBER#.
In short, I did not call.
Did not eat.
I will definitely complain.
You can't send it, why don't you speak up?
For so long
No, I haven't received a call.
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any longer #NUMBER# minutes.
A meal takes half an hour to prepare.
"None of #PRS_ORG# has arrived yet."
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel
Hello, the chicken from the restaurant is live.
Want to try tennis but afraid of sticking to it, so want to find a slightly expensive trainer first.
In fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then expensive normal shots are better than friendly ones, which are actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very weak, the ball just hits the palm, the vibration is very large, the hardball cannot be held, and the high hand is very difficult to control.
The logic and subtext behind their words are: "It's so difficult to play tennis, we know you can't learn, and we also know you can't afford expensive things, so we'll sell you cheap stuff that you can't do well, you'll play twice and won't want to play again, it's so convenient and you won't mind."
If you can really tell the difference, it means you've made progress. Wait until you're ready and I'll sell it to you for a good price.
Spend similar money to buy a second-hand racquet, choose Prince or Dunlop, as these two brands are not well-known, so good racquets are also not expensive. A new racquet priced at 500 or 600 yuan is enough, while a second-hand racquet priced at 200 yuan only allows you to enjoy a racquet priced at thousands of yuan.
"It's very friendly to beginners, but once you pass the beginner's stage, it becomes very difficult. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner's stage."
The order has been repeatedly delayed in delivery time.
Can you help me follow up?

Thank you.
So, in effect, I already have credit?
Do I need to reorder next? Originally, that order wasn't necessary, was it?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but the delivered food was missing many items and the chicken was live.

In fact, dressing is very important for girls who are a bit chubby.
The dress of an overweight girl should not be too short or too long, with a length difference of about knee-length, just enough to cover the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on your legs.
Too long will give people a feeling of being short and chubby.
If you divide your outfit into three segments - top, skirt, and long sleeves - it will naturally make you look taller. Using different colors for the top, skirt, and long sleeves will create an illusion of length.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the perfect match for chubby girls (a point the author can relate to), dark colors also serve as a good way to hide your body fat, and the elegant black short dress is also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark clothing, especially a short black skirt, will make a person appear thinner.
If you have big legs, avoid wearing tight socks and shoes that draw attention to your legs.
The greater the popularization, the less colorful it should be.
So as not to give people the impression that your legs and feet are fat.
We must talk about the secrets of proper dressing for chubby girls.
Overweight girls should avoid wearing tight skirts, and the top should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, you can wear black long socks or net stockings (the kind with fine mesh). Choose a soft print A-line skirt and pair it with a blouse with a collar, which can effectively hide the flaws of overweight girls.
Of course, even chubby girls wear short skirts too.
A fat girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the short skirt, which will enhance the effect of her plump figure.
"Short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, and this is the most IN combination for summer!"
If you are plus-sized on top but have slim legs, recommend choosing a glamorous knee-length dress.
It not only conceals the belly, but also highlights your advantages.
A short A-line skirt will be very slimming, especially for chubby girls. The top should be chosen to fit the body, creating a layered effect will be more slimming.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even for chubby people like me, can also try.
Even chubby girls can look stylish.
If you can master the art of dressing and matching, even chubby girls will become the focus of public attention.
After the change in clothing combination, we should also exercise more in life and try to get rid of the "chubby girl" label as soon as possible 😄

Girl shoots arrow for sister: "It's alright even if it's just a flesh wound" - Xinhua
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it at Wu Lin Square in Hangzhou.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl's generous donation" went viral on Weibo.
The photo shows that in Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a raised wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on it, indicating that after paying, pedestrians can shoot arrows.
The action triggered heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the spokesperson of the down-town branch of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl made such a violent move because she was the sister of the donor, but such behavior was not worth promoting. After the warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl, 11, targeted by fundraisers on street
In the viral photo, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board on which “人肉靶子，十元一箭” is written in black ink. The girl’s bank account and WeChat and Alipay accounts are written on another piece of wood in front of her.
The picture triggered controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens thought that this was an "eye-catching behavior", and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
We discovered the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we were patrolling near the square. At that time, the crowd had thinned out.
According to local media interviews with police officers at the scene, the two girls working at the stall were both around 20 years old and dressed attractively.
One of the girls, who had been crying all along, asked the passersby to play this game. The other girl stood by her side, helping her to drink water. She said her friend's sister suffered from leukemia and now urgently needed an operation. Please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the spokesperson of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau down-town branch told the reporter of the Beijing News that the girl, named Jiayi, was the donor.
But due to the high cost of treatment, they had no other choice but to beg for donations.
He said that throughout the entire process, one of the girls served as the trigger person, but did not participate, and throughout the entire process, no one fired arrows, only that someone watched and took photos, which were then posted on Weibo.
The police later determined that the crossbow used did not fall under regulatory scope.
The person in charge said, "Do not advocate this way of collecting donations."
After being warned by the embassy staff, she has already left the embassy.

It's much lighter than I had imagined, and it looks much better than I had imagined. The red color on the buttocks is a very good color for a wine, not too flashy, and overall much better than expected. It's a good buy and suitable for girls.
"Two years ago, I began to contact the night knights of Hong Kong. Over the past two years, the sex ratio is relatively high, but the quality is too hard!"
I would recommend my friends around me to buy this product as well!
All three machines in this series have been purchased at present!

A brand new original equipment manufacturer (OEM) gaming laptop with an exceptionally high price-to-performance ratio, designed with good looks and already pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
"The effect: I bought the software for the children to use 3D rendering. The children said they could use it without any problems. This computer is suitable for 3D design work."
He said it was good when I bought it for my son.
The computer is good, especially the customer service attitude, even if you don't understand the question, it's recommended to buy.
Not bad, the graphics of playing games are really charming.
What's hot in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympian athletes can win?
A while ago, there was an article titled “Quick! Project Managers Can Strike Gold in the Olympic Projects” that was very popular. The article mentioned that in many projects, project managers can absolutely be in the lead and no one can catch up: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are the daily lives of project managers; putting out fires, carrying pots, and apologizing are not even worth mentioning.
What seems to be a humorous article also reveals the daily frustrations of project managers, representing a lack of enthusiasm for current project management work.
And personnel engaged in project management are also gradually choosing to take action to get rid of their workplace dilemmas.
From the number of registered PMPs (Project Management Professionals certified internationally), it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners are learning to enhance their project management capabilities.
According to the "20th Anniversary Report on the Development of Project Management in China (1999-2019)" : As of September 2019, the accumulated number of PMP® examinations nationwide was close to 600,000, with approximately 420,000 PMP® certifications and about 300,000 effective certifications, accounting for 31.2% of the total PMP® certifications worldwide.
The number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year in the past decade, which indicates that more and more project managers realize that relying solely on past "experience" is no longer feasible in the rapidly changing work environment, and that we need to learn how to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the road ahead.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can we ensure smooth project management work without obstacles?
Many project management beginners indicate that through learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master knowledge points related to the ten domains and five process groups of project management. However, when they actually engage in project management work, they still feel lost.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: project management cognition is out of place, relying solely on personal experience; there is no project management theoretical support, not knowing how to practice; there is a lack of systematic project management process support, which makes it difficult to work during the project; project estimates are inaccurate, and project control sensitivity is poor; the project is dragged on and on.
Therefore, with more than ten years of focus on product innovation and R&D management, it has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has won such honorary titles as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and "Online Course - Research and Development Project Manager Professional Training".
The online course "Research and Development Project Manager Training" is a fragmented learning method that combines real-life case studies, tools, and methods of numerous development-oriented enterprises, helping you master project manager essential knowledge and standard actions, and take the next step in personal project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the cultivation process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operating results to the enterprise.
"Just talk is cheap. Let's first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by the China Telecom team (the former Huawai R&D management team), but also integrates international advanced project management methodology and numerous real business scenarios from well-known enterprises to provide a professional and easy-to-understand explanation of the course content."
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students apply what they have learned to their specific work after class.
Just one order of dumplings?
Why are there 6 fingers on each hand?
Believe it or not, on the eve of “Singles’ Day”, e-commerce merchants are advocating rational consumption to consumers.
This year’s “Singles’ Day” online payment transaction volume reached 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record.
The dazzlingly diverse red envelopes and eye-catching live shopping broadcasts once again helped consumers reap benefits. This shopping boom on one hand made people marvel at the strengthening national consumption, while on the other hand, we must calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumers.
On the eve of "Singles' Day", Credit Suisse Financial Services (hereinafter referred to "Credit Suisse") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 over 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents perform well in financial consumption, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, and further improvement is needed in basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low. "One old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous financial education. The report of Nielsen on the debt status of young people in China and the report of CCTV-2 on the consumption of young people in 2019-2020 show that young people have huge consumption potential, and credit consumption is an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no accumulated debt. Although young people as a whole show rational consumption trends, some of them have excessive consumption and follow-the-wind consumption behavior, which
As a card-holding financial institution, Credit Suisse has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and caring services, advocating for consumers to establish good and correct consumption habits, and actively responding to regulatory calls to improve consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially among young people.
In the past few years, Credit Suisse has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities targeting young people, including college students, and through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in partnership with domestic top universities, helping them reasonably guide their consumption demands, establish rational consumption concepts, and plan their consumption demands, thus accumulating wealth for them.
On the occasion of the Double Twelves, remind all consumer friends to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct money views, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption and borrowing mistakes, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Consumers must plan ahead and make timely repayments when shopping.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in personal credit report, which may have negative impact on future car buying, housing and other economic life.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant institutions have operating qualifications.
In the future, WeChat will use its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products to provide consumers with more personalized and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a reliable consumer finance partner for life.

Vietnam People's News Agency - Gulf Cooperation Council should respond to common challenges
The stopovers of Saudi King Salman include Amman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar by Mohammed bin Salman since the Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed comprehensive sanctions, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and maintaining close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension seriously affects the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and has negative impacts on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded the land sea route to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when all Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore relations with Qatar through their newly appointed ambassadors in Doha.
The resolution of the Gulf Arab states to resolve their differences and restore relations with Qatar is driven by the requirement to unite in the face of common challenges for the benefit of all countries and regional stability.
During the Saudi King's visit to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Amman and the two countries' companies have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi King's visit to Gulf countries comes at a time when Iran and world powers are trying to save the nuclear deal named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a deal which is criticized by some Gulf Arab countries for not resolving the issue of Iran's missiles.
Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and view Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All Gulf Cooperation Council countries believe that not addressing the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to contain Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
With the failure of negotiations between major countries and Iran to meet the wishes of Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that contribute to the slowdown of economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its contributions to promoting the restoration of Gulf unity, and to propose measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

The new mountain district ultra-marathon has the loudest breathing sound!
This car model that our team has brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price is close to 2 million yuan, the annual road tax is several thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it would be with 700 horses?
Even primary school students do not know. According to data, it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h. So, it is likely that myvi will reach 30 km/h before primary school students reach 100 km/h.
The low-slung body, the exaggerated scissor doors, the huge air intakes that surround the car on all sides, and the glass-enclosed 6.5 V12 engine - all of these perfect interpret the style of Lamborghini.
No need to say too much about the car model. Just Google it and you'll find everything. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not have given!
Too attention-grabbing, everywhere you go, people are staring, quite embarrassing (but kind of fun)!
1km fuel costs around RM1 (the driver doesn't care).
Practice makes perfect.
The engine noise was too loud, and my ears were ringing after getting out of the car (but it was still very refreshing).
The car is too big to park in a regular parking space, and I'm afraid I'll get doored by a parallel parker!
A bit lonely as there is no opponent on the road (just self-talk, irrelevant to the driver, haha).
Don't be mistaken, this video is not for sale, sorry!

Let the university spirit resonate with the times.
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic ideas and values that a university accumulates over a long period of development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the university spirit has been crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since its founding as the world's first modern university, the university has borne a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, this was during a time of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes in the times. It advocates the values of "明德济世" and "修齐治平" and the patriotism of "兴学强国".
Currently, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are increasingly prominent. The competition in education and technology on a global scale is intensifying, and the competition for talents is also increasing. Higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Advancing World-Class Universities and Disciplines" has set higher requirements for university development while demonstrating the confidence and determination of our country in moving from a high-education power to a high-education powerhouse.
How can we strive to enter the world’s top rankings in a short period of time, accelerate the establishment of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, and achieve a “ shortcut”?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also fully utilize their three advantages: the first is the follow-up advantage, through continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, achieving remarkable improvements in academic level and teaching quality; the second is the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years and promoting excellent traditional Chinese culture, thereby gathering strength, shaping the brand, and improving the image; the third is the institutional advantage, leveraging the institutional superiority of a socialist country, strengthening goal-drivenness
特别要意识到，建设世界一流大学不可能千校一面，各个学校在发挥优势的同时，必须彰显个性和特色。
A Chinese-style education should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique goals and target positioning, educational traditions, and resource endowment of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in our education: the first is to emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building a seamless integration of science and teaching and university-enterprise synergy that forms a comprehensive entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the second is to emphasize the characteristics of interdisciplinary integration, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, and cultivate an institutional environment of interdisciplinary cross-fertilization; the third is to emphasize the characteristics of educational and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and make the university spirit resonate with the times.
For Zhejiang University, "Seeking truth and innovation" school motto, "Diligence, morality, clarity of mind, and adherence to principles" shared values, as well as "Embracing the Yangtze River Delta and the Hangzhou Bay region, upholding truth and justice" and "Planting trees and loving our country" jointly constitute the latest expression of Zhejiang spirit.
This is the school adhering to the correct direction of study, constantly accumulating cultural height and gathering spiritual strength, which is an important guarantee. It is rich in connotation and far-reaching in meaning.
Among them, "Yangtze River Delta" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which is reflected in the chest-beating of "using all talents for the world". It means to draw on the excellent ideas of famous institutions of higher learning in the world; "Seeking Truth and Goodness" emphasizes the spirit of pursuing truth and goodness, which refers to the fact that universities should pursue truth while accepting the great deeds and characters of Confucianism; "Opening-up and Innovation" embodies the reform and innovation spirit, which includes both the pursuit of knowledge and the innovation of scientific research as well as the reform
It is the soul of the 120-year-old Zhejiang University.
The wise listen in silence, the intelligent see in the unformed.
"China's colleges and universities should further establish a socialist society with Chinese characteristics, fully understand the times and historical missions of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities."
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, and the national spirit resonate with each other, so as to provide unlimited impetus for achieving national prosperity and revitalizing the nation, and realizing the common ideal of human beings.

As NFTs went mainstream, the crypto community introduced a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to obtain stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game that uses blockchain technology as its underlying layer, incorporating various play methods including NFTs. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, having exceeded $3 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity’s daily revenue exceeded $8.2 million, close to “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially claimed that its daily active users exceeded one million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity will introduce a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, in addition to being able to obtain fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of sovereignty is not granted by game developers, but is ensured by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the company's choice, that is, the choice of investment target industry. First, we must choose an industry with a large growth space, a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, we must choose an industry with good growth potential in the future 3-5 years; finally, we must choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the racecourse refers to the market size, the length of the racecourse refers to the industry's development stage, and whether the racecourse is flat or rugged indicates the industry's competitive landscape.
Go for it!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize the 2021 situation and adjust the 2022 strategic layout.
The strategy is to "do the things right", that is, to do them correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which means to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find a direction, the tactics are to land. In most tactical thinking, there is a space for strategic thinking.
For example, in terms of increasing customer numbers (strategic thinking), it can be considered whether to continue deepening in the current field or expand horizontally to other fields (strategic thinking); for example, in terms of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), it can be considered how to improve the retention rate of core and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of improving activity participation rate (tactical thinking), it can be considered how to set up appropriate activity KPIs and achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving target customer participation degree, activating high-value silent customers, and targeting accurately; in terms of improving DAU (tactical thinking), it can be considered whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in 2021, 12 years after its inception.
On September 7th, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, declared Bitcoin as its legal currency, making it the first country or region to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares' Bitcoin ETF for the first time, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the US capital market, expanding the scope of cryptocurrency investment once again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft forking upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Overseas Chinese group complains of discrimination by Yuru and three other well-known springboard schools - Xinhua net
Xinhua News Agency Washington May 23 wire (Reporter: Xu Jianmei) On May 23, more than 130 Asian groups submitted protests to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice against the discrimination of Asian students in the admission process of the three prestigious universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which filed the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington that day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yuankuang, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions of US universities has doubled over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians among the three US universities remains basically unchanged.
Many studies have shown that these universities systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian applicants during the so-called "holistic" admissions process.
According to Zhao Yukun, in 2014, Sande's study showed that in these three institutions, the admission rate of Asian people was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all members of the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yuanku told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can carry out investigations and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asian students after the determination of facts.
They also hope that universities will take the initiative to address this issue and change their admission policies for Asian students.
So far, the three universities named in the complaint have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it once complained about Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on the grounds of procedure.
In addition to the Chinese American group, the complaint also includes American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Yuji Town, Zhejiang Province, through a real estate broker. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner of the house, Lin, who is the relative of the landlord, transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the buyer on the "Factory Sale and Purchase Contract" and stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign a factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the main provisions of the contract, such as the scope of factory sales and payment methods, resulting in the delay of the signing of the housing sales contract.
Taking into consideration that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned 200,000 yuan deposit to Lu.
The house that was hard to miss was bought, the down payment was ready, and the mortgage was also prepared, but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Landlord both surprised and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Lin on behalf of the People's Court of Youyang City.
The court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and that the failure should not be solely attributed to the defendant. Rather, it should be reasonably inferred that the negotiations had broken down, and therefore the plaintiff should not be entitled to liquidated damages. The defendant should not be required to pay double the return of the deposit as a breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff files an appeal.
Recently, the appeals court upheld the original verdict.
【Translation】 Lawyers remind that due care must be exercised during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer must fulfill the necessary cautionary obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders Democracy Summit" is "a move to draw a demarcation line on the ideological front, to turn democratization into weaponization and to incite confrontation and split in the name of democracy".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on people, carried out 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, and plot 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences."
Democracy has long become a "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action in line with Biden's election pledges.
The two-day conference will be conducted through video conferencing, with leaders from 111 countries invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but without inviting leaders from China and Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for having problems with its own democracy and claimed that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also doubts internationally and in the United States, for example, about the invitation list, which includes some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some suspect that the purpose of the summit is not to promote democracy but to serve geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also participated in the video democracy summit.
The statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday said that "the American disease of democracy is most pronounced today. Issues such as money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political extremism, social fissures, racial conflicts, and wealth polarization are becoming more and more serious." American democracy is built on the basis of "a rich man's game."
In his speech, President Trump stated, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democratic barriers, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and resist the forces of authoritarianism and corruption that seek to undermine democracy."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "we must continuously update it in every generation, in my opinion, this is a decisive challenge of our time.
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "are facing sustained and distressing challenges, and democracy needs warriors to defend it."
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year campaign after this Democracy Summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned in-person democracy summit at the end of 2022.
Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year, said Biden.
Okay, I'm just afraid he got the wrong address.
Japanese restaurant (five-star hotel)
Environment: Regular [Service Bell] Service: The dish is served quickly "Greek Marzipan Cake" is my must-order dish. The marzipan cake is too delicious to eat!😋 If you like sweets, you must try "East Sichuan Pickled Fish and Bean Curd Soup". The soup is very delicious, and the bean curd is very fresh. Marzipan...
Tasty meat, good service with passion.
It's been a long time since we last met. Fruit picking is still so delicious and the materials are so real. This is my first attempt at making dumplings, and it tastes just like the soft and fluffy southern-style dumplings I love!
The moisture content of the congee was just right, and the portion was very generous. The chicken wings made of tinfoil were as delicious as ever, and the soup was not bad either. The pickled vegetables were also well-handled.
Tasty, attentive service, good meat.
Ji Chang Old Store was also a popular existence many years ago. The single-story building and wooden floor.
The congee always takes a long time to finish, and the pot of congee has cracked...
It has been a few years since I last ate at Jiaochang, and the rise of various small shops selling Cantonese cuisine has split the flow of customers.
There will always be a seat for you when you arrive, and the dishes are as delicious as ever.
The dish tastes good and the meat is delicious.
Japanese food delivery.
[Rice] Meal: This dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three cups of chicken: the vegetables are a bit too many, and the chicken is a bit too little.
The dish tasted a bit off, with a lack of saltiness at the bottom. This highlighted the sweetness, so everyone can add some sweetness and various spices to the dish.
What is the Red Card rule?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat delicious food, of course, there are also people who like to drink wine. Red Label whisky is currently one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has won the International Wine & Spirit Competition award.
Every bottle of red wine has its unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, it would be a waste of its aroma.
So how do you drink a Bloody Mary?
Here's a simple introduction for you all.
The Red Card rule:
The "Glen Grant" red label whisky is composed of about 35 types of Scottish malt whisky, and has the characteristics of traditional Scottish malt whisky, with a strong fragrance and taste of honey and smoke.
The entrance is fresh and fragrant, slightly reminiscent of grass and strong smoke.
This drink can be directly consumed with ice or mixed with your favorite beverage.
The Bloody Mary cocktail, which originated in the United States, has become a timeless fashion in China due to its adaptation to the taste of the locals.
These sweet drinks not only neutralize acidity, but also visually please people. When added to drinks, they can change the taste of alcohol and make it more refreshing.
The authentic and most traditional way to drink it is with a slice of lemon and a spoonful of sugar (white or brown).
The authentic red wine has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can balance the acidity, lemon will give the wine a fresh aroma, of course, the sweet-sour degree can be adjusted according to personal preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink red wine. You can try them as a reference. We hope that our introduction can help you.
Education Thought: How do college entrance exams make “tigers” and “flops”?
Three students from Lanzhou Transportation University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university entrance exam and proposing to increase the exam difficulty, change the exam format, and make the exam truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college entrance exams have been a popular topic.
In the university campus, students come from all over the country, with different levels of ability, and studying at different levels, learning situations are diverse.
It is inevitable to have different feelings when dealing with such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are all the same type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Without hard work, a student may be able to pass the exam with a focused attack, but if they want other methods, they may achieve twice the results with half the effort.
"In this way, even those who do not invest in learning during normal times can pass the exams, and even get high scores." "The learning dominator" never attends classes and always does well on homework and notes, but their performance on the exam is not much higher than average."
"So it seems that the students of Lanzhou University are reflecting the problems that exist in college entrance examinations, and it is believed that such a situation is not limited to Lanzhou University."
From this perspective, these three students who wrote directly deserve a thumbs up.
In fact, everyone who has been to college knows that it is common for students to try various ways to "obtain" exam questions from their teachers, compete for the exam scope, and seek "intensive tutoring" before the exam. It is even common to see students cheat during the exam, and even ask their teachers for help after the exam.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, whether a university exam is qualified depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific issues based on this foundation.
At the undergraduate level, majors become more specialized, and many courses focus on foundational knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether you have comprehensively mastered the basic knowledge points of a subject is what college entrance examinations are all about.
The basic knowledge of undergraduate courses is mainly based on disciplinary foundational theories and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large, and it is mainly fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned 20 years ago in college is still being studied now and is still the focus."
"But the knowledge points are basic and do not represent a single type of exam or repeated questions."
In many colleges, exams are generally composed of question groups, which are then compiled into试卷 by departmental senior teachers. The exam papers are also graded by all the teachers in the department, which helps to some extent to overcome the problem of repeated questions.
But to design a set of tests that are in line with actual teaching and have a normal distribution according to students' overall learning status, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation, and analyze the degree of students' learning in order to make the exam questions adapt to the difficulty and type, so that both the basic knowledge examination and the ability examination can be conducted comprehensively and innovatively.
Exams are the commanding rod of university education. What kind of exams a student will face will determine the corresponding mode of study. A long time ago, this would affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the recommendation letter for students and has already deployed a reformed plan throughout the school.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out research and course final examination self-check, formulate examination questions and relevant regulations, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination questions and review cycle, refine grading criteria, and strengthen comprehensive supervision of all teaching sections.
Solving the problem of single-type test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is a major issue that college entrance examinations need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the key is that teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only need to understand the teaching content, but also need to understand the learning situation of students. Only in this way can teaching and learning be better connected, and a positive interaction be established, so that the examination is more in line with reality, and both “stars” and “duds” can receive their due.
Can you deliver instead if you can't change my store location?

"Jinfei Wedding Dress Photography (South Street Store) has not yet opened a branch."
Due to our poor scheduling, we had to reschedule twice before the photoshoot. Advisor Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the schedule.
Later, they chose a nice weekend to take pictures.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, all speak highly of her.
That was my first formal make-up in my life. Wow ~ I can't believe it, one day I will also become so pretty, haha.
Xiaojing and another sister (sorry, I forgot her name) applied makeup super patiently, and the makeup also looked very natural.
The scenery was shot in Jianghan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day and I did not feel very cold. While taking photos, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothing, hairstyle, and a little bit that was not good, and immediately helped us to arrange.
The photographer is also very humorous, and feels very happy after taking pictures for a day.
When selecting photos, as we had seen many cases online, we did not want to let customers delete too many photos. However, during the photo selection process, we truly had no intention of adding any extra photos. We only included 24 photos directly from the package, not a single extra photo was added. (I heard that my cousin, who got married just a few months after me, had over 7,000 photos added to her package, bringing the total to over 8,000 photos. I was shocked at the time and feared that I might have selected too many photos myself.)
The photos were fixed today, Lan Lan sent them to me, and I saw two that were not good. They immediately helped me redo them.
Compare the photos my sister took before, I think our photos are really satisfactory, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I wholeheartedly recommend everyone to go see the wedding photos of Miss Chan!
The set price is 3999 yuan.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful for your sincere wishes for our happiness and a bright future.
How much is this set?
What are the conditions to use the $32?
Okay, no refunds.
Your horse did not find it.
"I cannot find it."

3,200 babies born in Shaanxi without birth certificates due to counterfeit paper cut-off
On the 11th day of the month, the National Registration Bureau of Azerbaijan said that due to the stock of counterfeit currency, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October. To date, 3200 people have been affected.
However, the director of the center, Khalid Amirunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates are already recorded in the system, and the birth certificates will be issued next week when the fake ones are delivered.
He explained at a press conference that it had taken up to 10 months to investigate allegations of fabrication against a web media outlet by the Sabah newspaper.
He said the issue arose two months ago and that Salt Lake was facing similar problems.
One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China.
He explained that the counterfeit paper used by the Saipan newspaper is different from that used in other areas, so it cannot be shipped to other states.
It was revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit notes arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The station will send someone to pick up the documents in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday and bring them back for the final printing, which should take no more than two working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the admission notice.
He added that Shabbi has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates since the beginning of this year.
More than 7 years
Is it just about time?
I mean food.

Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11 wire (Reporter: Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tian) The State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus outbreak in coastal cities, requiring individuals who have left the mainland within the last 48 hours and are not connected to Hong Kong, Macao or other coastal cities with a land border to hold a negative COVID-19 test result, and those who have arrived at a mainland coastal city should hold a negative COVID-19 test result before leaving.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the scope of coastal cities in each province, district and city to the date of March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also proposed that conditional coastal cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The head of the Disease Prevention and Control Office of the National Health and Family Planning Commission introduces that for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the local main economic pillar, and both sides of the border are frequent.
Implement differentiated management policies, with one line of defense becoming two lines, in order to achieve front-end control, compress the risk of disease outbreaks, and achieve the maximum effect of controlling the epidemic with the minimum social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been several local outbreaks of epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas cities.
The above notice points out some problems in the local epidemic monitoring and forecasting, high-risk personnel's closed-loop management is not implemented, regular nuclear acid detection is not in place, carcass disposal is not in place at all levels of the cold chain, and the management of isolation camps is not standardized.
The notice requires efforts to improve the mechanism for preventing and controlling epidemics in coastal cities, a sound system for monitoring and forecasting epidemics, and the implementation of border control measures in nine aspects, in order to fill the gaps in the prevention and control short board of coastal cities, do a scientific and accurate prevention and control job, and strengthen the external input prevention and control barrier.
The notice emphasizes that cities on both sides of the strait should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic and the people's livelihood security work in synchronization, publish and open the people's livelihood security hotline, and regularly check the hidden problems in the supply and price of basic necessities of life, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems反映 by the masses.
According to the notice, the coastal cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, municipalities) where open land, water and air ports are located, as well as the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the directly governed cities where they are located, and the specific scope will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and promptly announced.

Oil pipeline video shows the beginning of the US military's 20-year bloodshed - Xinhua
"Video source: pipeline"
On December 11th, a micro-documentary named "Killer Machine" on the oil pipeline platform caused widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan war under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", forcefully exporting American democracy, and engaging in 20 years of warlordism, bloodlust, and indiscriminate killing, committing all sorts of crimes against humanity.
Abusing unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian locations, distorting humanity and establishing death squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" and subjected "suspects" to various tortures and humiliations.
A series of anti-human crimes has aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war "the more terrorist the more anti-terrorism".
The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people; it has only brought a country full of landmines and countless acts of killing and destruction.
"Watch the video, let's uncover the truth together about the US's "anti-terrorism" bloodshed and the false face of American democracy!"
Accidentally, I came across the following article that discusses why a customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to help with packaging, even though packaging is a deep processing and not within the scope of operations for a bonded logistics company. Perhaps this article can explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visit many dairy factories and come into contact with many production lines of dairy products.
In fact, the raw materials used for packaging and listening are exactly the same, with no difference at all.
So, people will certainly ask: Why is the warranty period for packaged products one year, while that for built-in products is two years or even longer?
Alternatively, why is the price difference between hearing aids and behind-the-ear devices so large?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the same material, only if it is expensive, is considered good by others.
Some consumers with this mentality have even said that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different!
Now, let me first tell you the reason why listening is expensive. Where is the cost?
Why are the prices so different when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the packaging price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profits are low or even negative. So how do these manufacturers survive?
So they have a very large increase in pricing to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers recommend welding as opposed to bagging.
And how much advertising do you think so many manufacturers pay every year, in the tens or even hundreds of millions, where does this cost come from?
As we all know.
As society develops, market promotion costs, such as mall promoters, mall display fees, product giveaways, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, these are new products that come with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials increase will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, are not afraid to use any means, hook up with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products, and earn profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan per prescription.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operational methods, and in fact, this approach harms consumers.
It is recommended that people buy packaged milk powder in cans under the premise of having a can at home, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and have no effect on children.
Don't think that the shelf life of packaged goods is longer than bulk packaging. If the shelf life of packaged goods and bulk packaging is the same after packaging, it only means that packaged goods are not easy to preserve after packaging and are prone to quality changes.
The food is cold and dry now.
And the soup was delicious!
"Immediately cancel, the thing he #PRS_ORG# sent is definitely not cool."

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua net
When strolling in the book market, one can often feel the explosion of successful academic books.
Today's successful self-help books all promote the "best principle" - that is, to assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, we have passed over the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books have a common feature - either work hard and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either climb Mount Everest or stay at home.
This "best principle" will be recognized as "absolutely correct" by everyone, but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
"Because this theory advocates a path of 'you must be determined, make a 180-degree turn, and make a drastic change in your life', which is precisely the Achilles heel of many people."
For those who cling to old habits and resist change, you might as well scream "You need to change!" in their ear. It's undoubtedly an act of self-deception.
Most people will be hesitant at the beginning of "transformation", not daring to take the first step, and it is difficult to make a firm decision; or they make a decision to "transform" based on momentary impulse, and take the first step bravely, but it is often short-lived, and they cannot sustain it.
The famous monologue of Mr. Ma in "From Tomorrow On" is a classic that vividly portrays this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often beyond the limits of ordinary people, making most people "gasp at the door."
Perhaps the "Secondary Principle" is a way that may lead more ordinary people to a path of relative success.
The core of the "secondary principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a "little victory leads to a big victory" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Everest, just climb the small sand dune by your door, because that will always be stronger than the original step.
In short, anything is better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it has become more likely for ordinary people to persevere, and the success rate will increase as long as they persist.
However, the successful path that follows the "second-best principle" is slightly shorter.
In short, while the "best principle" may sound on the surface to ensure success for all, it ultimately motivates only a few; the "second best principle" is more effective in motivating more people and maximizing benefits for as many as possible.
Do I need to reorder now?
No one is answering the phone.
Endless procrastination.
Not yet.
When will it arrive?
How can we contact you?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait anymore, thank you.

I want to ask how to contact jockeys.

The translation of this sentence from Chinese to English is: "The resource storage of Lake Qinghai this year increased by 71,000 tons - Xinhua network."
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 11 wire (Reporter: Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxing) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department that the latest monitoring results showed that the quantity of crucian carp resources in the Qinghai Lake this year increased by 71,000 tonnes to 108,500 tonnes, which was 40 times more than when protection began in 2002.
The grass carp, known as "crucian carp" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species in Qinghai Lake and plays a significant role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of fish caught and the degradation of the aquatic environment due to human activities such as massive killings and overfishing have greatly reduced the number of Lake Baikal omul, and the Lake Baikal omul resource reserve in 2002 was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake sturgeon was listed as a critically endangered species in the "Red List of China's Wildlife".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake fishing and prohibited any unit, group or individual from catching and selling carp and its products in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial breeding and release, as well as cleaning up the main inflow rivers and channels of the Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the protection intensity of Qinghai Lake has continued to increase, and the reserves of Qinghai Lake fish have gradually increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, said that as of now, the cumulative number of artificial breeding and release of Lake Qinghai carp has reached 180 million, with a contribution rate of more than 23% to the recovery of Lake Qinghai carp resources.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia. The Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices of key water areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake for total prohibition of fishing, and established a comprehensive prohibition management system of “one river, one lake, one prohibition”.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I have to put it in the bag, it's cold.
"Do you think that takeout is packed in a bag?"
We only see one bag.
"I want to know if it was lost or if someone took it."
It's been an hour and still nothing.
Just saw an example of a fake article, it was too long.
Give a brief summary to the unknown male.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15 on a particular day. Menarche typically occurs around age 50.
Once a month, as long as your body is healthy.
"But it's not regular enough to make precise predictions, with a margin of error of about one week, so it's necessary to prepare in advance, and sometimes luck can intervene (suddenly several days ahead)."
The length of time, amount of bleeding, and severity of pain vary from person to person. Some people bleed for three days, while others bleed for a week. Some people have light bleeding, while others have heavy bleeding. Some people have no reaction, while others feel so much pain that they need to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Pain can change over time, and not bleeding does not mean one will never bleed again.
"During the several days of uncontrollable menstruation, the only thing one can do is to use a sanitary napkin or a sanitary cloth to prevent blood from flowing onto the chair."
The main reason for menstrual cramps is due to the release of prostaglandins. Eating broccoli can effectively alleviate menstrual cramps during the first few days of the menstrual cycle, but it is of no use once the cramps have already started.
Prior to the physiological period, due to excessive release of uterine blood and prolactin, it is easy to lactate.
If you have guessed the period, no matter how mysterious your stomach is, it will come within two days.
It is recommended to change sanitary pads every two to three hours to avoid the growth of bacteria, and to remove sleeping time. The worst scenario is to change six times a day, every seven days, which amounts to 42 pieces a month. If extra pieces are prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, and not one piece per month.
"I am an intelligent language assistant. Please provide the text for translation."
The hormonal changes during menstruation may cause more mood swings, and the ovulation period may also cause emotional instability due to changes in internal hormones, which is quite normal, and the body gives itself a headache.
But official crime statistics show that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and emotional problems will not be used as an excuse.
"The flow is not just blood, it contains shedding endometrium."
"After the end of the menstruation, the endometrium of the uterus is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. This can be understood as the uterus is a house, and a new house is built every month (endometrial thickening) to prepare for the guest, but the guest did not come, so all the house was demolished (menstruation discharge) and a new house was built next month, and so on."
"The moon is very inconvenient. For decades, it flows blood for 24 hours every month and causes abdominal and back pain. Who wants it?"
But people can be born only because his mother had gone through the confinement. Confinement is the house prepared for you to live for ten months when you first come to this world. We should thank our mother for her regular and healthy confinement.
In the past, many things were suppressed for women. Society told women that they were dirty, shameful, and everyone believed it. But times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting and that women's bodies are prepared for life by pregnancy, they should not say it in front of a large audience. Women should stand up and not think like that. Men who have never experienced it or do not understand it should not be so ungrateful and disrespectful to their mothers. How can they face their mothers with such an attitude? How can they want their own children with such an attitude?
Finally, sisters, try using sanitary pads, they're really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, which is quite disappointing.
In addition, order food for the children to eat.
Hope the store can check the products
Is the bathtub bubbling because of an electrical short-circuit?
Choosing the right foot bath can have great therapeutic benefits for your feet. Today, we will provide an answer to this question and hope to be of help to our friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly favored by consumers. A large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from RMB 100 to over RMB 1,000. This has given consumers great choices.
In relevant data tables, compared to traditional home appliances, the sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are booming, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety risk.
"Don't step on the electric water, it's too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he had bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a sense of numbness in his feet when he soaked them.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the bathtub, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt a strange sensation at the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried using a pen, and to his surprise, the pen actually worked. He found that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
Afterwards, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitude was not bad. Although they had withdrawn the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that the bathtub, which has been popular for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature setting, applicable population, material safety, and so on.
However, in general, the bathtub is not prone to electricity problems, but it is also possible that a small number of products may not be strictly sealed during production.
Therefore, choose a divided foot bath when purchasing.
The separation of water and electricity poses no safety hazards.
Feel free to use a pencil while you're at it.
The 13th China Tea Expo kicked off - news headlines -湖南日报网 - China News Service Online
"Hunan Daily December 10 news (correspondent Zhangang Wu, reporter Hubo Han, communication assistant Liu Xiaoli, photography Li Jian) The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Innovative Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center this morning, displaying the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of achieving a trillion-dollar tea industry."
Deputy Director-General of the China National Sales Cooperation Association Huo Shunli and Deputy Director-General of the Provincial People's Congress Yao Hong attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Xinhua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a keynote speech at the opening ceremony, saying that the rise of Pu'er tea is injecting new impetus into the new era.
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a billion-dollar Pu'er tea industry, forming a "Pu'er tea with three colors and four waters" development pattern.
Innovation in the tea industry within the province is being stepped up. The main tea varieties, including green tea, black tea and red tea, are rotated for planting. The tea tourism industry is being promoted in the tea producing areas, which will benefit a large number of tea farmers.
With the turn of the wind and water, the red tea is reinvigorated.
According to experts in the tea industry, tea farmers can earn income all year round from the picking of green tea, red tea and black tea, and tea plantation output value is on the rise.
At the launching ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and they were thrilled with the "Origins of Hunan Red Tea".
At the modern red tea museum, Fujian tea merchants immediately placed an order for a high mountain tea named "Ice Ring Spring".
Wang Jianfeng, the Secretary-General of the Tea Association, said that the current epidemic and other factors have to some extent affected the tea market, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, brilliance is abound.
The new red tea is a touch of red, injected with the connotations of tea culture. The atmosphere is warm and lively, and the tea industry in Hunan welcomes the new spring.

Ting Zirui: A letter to a friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the 30-plus years since our relative's untimely demise, especially those who responded to my personal humanitarian appeals for assistance both domestically and internationally since the beginning of 1994 until now.
Now, most survivors' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and found jobs.
Your selfless help has helped these needy families through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is raging globally and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I humbly request that you cease donations to us, the Tiananmen Mother's Group, a humanitarian relief effort that should have ended long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your efforts will be engraved in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
"Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars Association (IFCSS) and the Minneapolis China Democracy Fund (MCDF)."
In the process of humanitarian aid, the All-American Association and the Minnesota-based China Democracy Fund are parallel organizations, and project implementers often intersect.

Aid often cannot smoothly reach the hands of those in need on June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Professor Ding, a specialized team called "Tiananmen Mother" was established to coordinate and distribute humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June Fourth Orphans Education Fund" and executed it for 11 years. In 2009, after all June Fourth orphans graduated from university, MCDF established the "June Fourth Martyrs Relief Fund for the Elderly" and has been implementing it until now.
The funds for these projects mainly come from donations from campuses and society on the night of June 4th, from personal generosity, and are supported by the Brothers for Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Research Foundation.
Until last year, the June Fourth victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of June Fourth 31 years ago.
During this period, "China Human Rights" was also independently carrying out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for donations on June 4 is for the donors to consider. We are indeed some retired people, and our income is not as affluent as before. Therefore, we express our gratitude to Mr. Ding's letter of thanks to his "compatriots".
We will respect their decision to terminate the project within two years and restore it as needed.
We express our gratitude and respect to those who have been advocating generosity and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid for years.

The set price is 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the rabbit's review. In the beginning, I also thought that refusing the old style was not suitable for the old style. I did not expect that the finished product would be so beautiful.
Thank you, Denmark, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will enable us to move forward with full energy, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is amazing! I strongly recommend all partners to come.

How do I give money?

A programming whitepaper about sharing personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, self-study is better because training costs a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
"But if the intention is to break into this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-control."
If you have strong self-study ability, you can choose to self-study, but it will be quite tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the institution's teaching strength. If the teaching strength is not strong enough, then the training institution is meaningless. Of course, the teaching strength of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing, it's better to investigate this training institution. It's best to investigate the students of this institution to know the true nature of the institution, whether the courses are good or not.
Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't made a definite introduction about yourself, and learning this thing and your personal situation have a great relationship.
Factors such as profession, age, desired language, and even the city you live in, are all related to the industry you want to learn or are interested in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer science graduate, I recommend self-study if there is enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many online and offline training institutions are actually not bad, but the learning cost is high and the investment time is relatively long. It usually takes 3-6 months to focus on training.
However, if I were to speak of these situations, self-study would be very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources on the internet, and there are also many training resources on the B站. If you don't know where to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer major but can pay a certain amount of learning and time costs, I suggest going to training institutions to learn. This way of learning is not too tiring, and the teachers explain in detail. If you have questions, there are people who specialize in answering them. In addition, there is help in learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions nowadays will sign employment agreements and have internal referral fees. After learning, they will recommend going to companies. As a result, the interview process for finding a job can be saved.
The above are my views. As I mentioned earlier, I only gave a general introduction because I did not understand your situation. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication and consultation.
I said 15 minutes ago, I saw it on the app.
What is called
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I am proficient in installing, cleaning, and repairing various appliances such as water heaters, purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, barrels, stoves, lamps, and lighting fixtures, as well as providing professional carpentry and home services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up, I work hard for life and it's tiring but I must continue.
"Life won't disappoint anyone who works hard. If you like, pay attention to me. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up."
Life is like this, people only see the results, but we have to go through the process alone. Facing life, we are not only strong, but also continue. We have no choice but to go forward, we can't turn back and go back...
Cleanliness is work and responsibility, life is beautiful because of service, and service is excellent because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest job, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home, and see the satisfied smile and raised thumb of the customer. At that moment, all the tiredness is worth it, and there is always a return!
My daily work.
"Your request, my service."
Serve with care, clean with care, keep the beauty.
The details you are concerned about are well taken care of by my housekeeper. I will serve you with all my heart.

Cleaning both indoors and outdoors is my daily job.
Although crystal lamps are beautiful, they will become dull if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after being cleaned can they shine again, just like life.
Carefully crafting can lead to success, delicate shaping can create refinement, and we are serious about it.
Give me a chance, and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism deserves trust, and your recognition is my biggest encouragement!
All professions nowadays are not as good as they used to be!
"But I always believe that as long as you are serious, persevere, and work hard, you will be better than others, and at least be better than those who only complain."
The plan for the day begins in the morning, and all good things start from there. Hope you carry happiness, luck, health, and willingness to start a new day and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When I was young, happiness was something that could be possessed. As I grew older, it became a goal to achieve. But as I matured, I realized that happiness is a state of mind, and understanding that is where true happiness lies.
Be true to yourself, be kind-hearted, make the most of your life today; life is a one-way street, walk your own path; life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mind, live a long and happy life!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it.
Since we can't avoid it, we might as well face it head-on.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated; but if you face difficulties with courage, you will ultimately find solutions.
Chongqing strategists jointly organized the first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh December 12 wire (Reporter Wang Haizhou) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other countries including China participated in the biennial.
This biannual exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Fund and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. The director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Tian Fang, serves as the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stone", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social culture development.
The biennial occupies nearly 12,000 square meters of space across six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Stone Bridging the River," "Inheriting the Experiment," "Border Thinking," "Moving Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Artistic Creation."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art. Equally attractive are the 12 works of Chinese artists. Some artists created works using recycled materials in an innovative way. For example, Xu Beihong constructed a classic landscape painting “The Endless Landscape” (2014) using waste materials.
巴克利表示，希望本届双年展能够建立国际对话，让全球观众有机会了解沙特蓬勃发展的文化产业和创意社区，加强互动往来。
Abdulnour said: "The goal of the biennial is dual, both to involve Saudi contemporary art in the global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the two-year period, in which artists, curators and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: The standardized management of village public interest positions
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming December 12 wire (Reporter: Lin Beifeng) In order to continue to do well in poverty alleviation and employment support and consolidate and expand poverty alleviation and struggle achievements, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public interest positions in rural areas, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduces that, at present, a total of 448,300 public interest positions are opened in Yunnan for the employment of poverty-stricken groups in rural areas, which plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken group realize income increase, consolidate poverty eradication achievements, and effectively improve the rural public service capability.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs, the Ministry of Rural Rejuvenation, the Ministry of Finance, and seven other departments, mainly for the standardization of the recruitment, management and development of grassroots public interest positions.
In terms of position development settings, the new regulations clearly state that position development should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "flexible allocation of positions, fixed person, dynamic management, and total control". "Who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" as well as "one person one position, voluntary publicity, and unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-employment training, and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of public interest positions in rural areas, the standards and methods of subsidies for public interest positions in rural areas, and stipulate that the departments responsible for the development of public interest positions in rural areas shall purchase commercial liability insurance for the placement of public interest position personnel. The relevant departments shall periodically supervise the subsidies for the development of public interest positions in rural areas.

Hello.

Although the right wing had their moment in history, it was short-lived. It's like shining a light on an ant or pouring water on a sweaty forehead; a little bit of ambition goes a long way.
But in fact, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative system and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Hui-tsung's arguments, I respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social problems.
"But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that a necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to the people's livelihood, and the mixing of political factions into muddy waters. Then, it will be foreigners taking advantage of the vacuum."
"To change or improve China, we must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country for the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political opportunities are not rightists, but opportunists."
Let's talk more.
Left, in fact, is an orphan of time and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party would also listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when necessary. However, this does not mean that the left has given up, because what the left wants is precisely the rubbish that the Communist Party has thrown away!
Recently, I've seen some friends being bullied and insulted by others, and it's really frustrating. I don't think it's worth it.
Don't try to reason with idiots and leftists, they are both as stubborn as a mule.
"Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make enemies recognize us. Why should we?"
Here's the English translation:  "I tell my friends that when the anti-rightists abuse you for five hairs, and when the leftists abuse you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!"
Many people have ideals when they are young, but as they grow older, they forget their ideals or pursue them in a distorted way.
With ideals gradually fading away, even the young dragon will eventually become a demon.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom. China, from its historical and cultural genes, should tend to be left-leaning.
The domestic right wing is concerned with efficiency and development, while the left wing emphasizes regulation and fairness as well as safety.
Nowadays, the society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and the Sino-American trade war is undoubtedly to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although it doesn't make sense, let's just approve it.
Please provide the sentence for translation.
In the past two years, Emperor Napoleon's blockade and siege of Huawei chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused enormous losses to "US" enterprises.
As a result of US pressure on China’s chip industry, allied enterprises and domestic enterprises simultaneously imposed a blockade on China’s chip industry. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected. The R&D investment of chip production enterprises decreased and capacity declined, which caused chaos in the global chip supply chain.
"Nowadays, the shortage has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car production, mobile phone price hikes, and almost all industries that use chips are affected."
In order to master the "chip" sovereignty, more and more technology giants begin to move towards "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the US has recently taken action frequently, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, as well as supporting US domestic technology giants. For example, in order to regain the leading position in the semiconductor field, US technology giant Intel has invested US$20 billion to build a 2nd wafer processing plant in Arizona, USA, and open up its semiconductor foundry business to the outside world.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to snatch away TSMC's "dish".
This is certain because Intel, as a leading technology giant in the US, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large pool of talents and technological reserves, which must enable it to quickly rise and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for Intel's decision, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) founder Morris Chang did not even bat an eyelid.
At the “2021 Grandmaster Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongjun made a surprising comment on Intel’s move to invest in the crystal factory. He said without reservation that Intel’s foundry chip factory is quite a joke.
The reason why Zhang Zhongjun is quite dissatisfied with Intel's incursion into the round crystal field is because Zhang Zhongjun has been nursing a grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Intel was a diamond in the US semiconductor industry, occupying the top position globally and dominating the world's semi-conductor industry.
Into the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been monopolized by a few strong players.
At that time, the semi-conductor industry was characterized by IDM mode, and chips were completed by a factory from design to packaging. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this pattern makes some small businesses unable to bear the burden, and many semi-conductor entrepreneurs face huge line construction costs but can only hope.
In response to market demand, in the late 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongjun heard that there were companies that specialized in chip design. Since there were companies that specialized in design, then it could establish a factory specialized in crystal manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongjun's idea became a reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor was born.
Taicang Electronics focuses on the "polishing" single link in the main business and only provides subcontracted polishing services without design.
At the time when台积电 was first established, it was just a small ant before the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongjun once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor only made manufacturing segments of the semiconductor industry, they obviously had too high an opinion of themselves and refused to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor.
Zhang Zhongjun also believed that Intel at that time was incapable of providing polysilicon production services.
I never imagined that the giant in the production of synthetic diamonds would also begin to do diamond processing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongjun felt that Intel's entry into the diamond industry is very ironic.
The market capitalization of Taiwan Semiconductor has now surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel is also reluctant to go alone.
Today, TSMC has already pushed towards 3nm chips, while Intel still remains at 14nm from 7 years ago.
Wanting to surpass oneself is not an easy task.
Impatiently.

Let's take a look at some【weird searches】today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: February 2nd Lunar New Year, rise in housing prices, and the Kweichow Moutai incident, creating a peak in public opinion, followed by a decline in the form of a smooth curve, and finally dissipation. If there is a second round of public opinion, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the network sentimentalized model displayed by the website of the network office.
What is an abnormal sentiment?
Randomly select six hotspots from the same event, presenting six peaks, sawtooth and cliff-like.
【孤峰状】即人为加热，迅速冲榜热搜，引起大众关注；【锯齿状】即周期性加热，确保话题盘踞热搜榜单；【断崖状】即集体撤离，该热搜发挥完“功能”，接到新任务、冲向新战场。
In Figure 9, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference. This must be a unified water army receiving the task and launching a new offensive.
The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot topics are simultaneously listed, which attract attention, which are responsible for popularizing science, which are confrontational, which shift focus, which affect cognition, which lead to erroneous judgments, which stir up emotions, which constrain decision-making, and which are divided into batches and sub-nodes for detailed tactical operations, almost taking into account all elements in the dissemination and spread of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science that involves taking a position, appealing to emotions, and using only objective data, making it impossible for black PR to exist.
Everyone leaves a trace, let's dig it out together.

Mauritius reports first case of Omsk virus infection - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12 wire: Comprehensive report by Xinhua News Agency correspondents abroad: Mauritius, Seychelles and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of HIV infection on the 10th day of the month.
According to Health Minister Keliangi Geiger, one of the infected individuals was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected individual was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa.
After isolation treatment in the hospital, the two patients' nuclear acid detection results turned negative. They have now returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th day of the month, the Cyprus Ministry of Health announced the country's first confirmed cases of Omega-3 virus infection.
All three are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. None of them were hospitalized due to mild symptoms.
To prevent the spread of the Ebola virus, the Spanish government has continuously increased its prevention and control measures.
From December 6th to next January 10th, all passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by air must pay for a nuclear acid test at the airport.
On the 10th, the Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health also announced that the country will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 against the novel coronavirus.
On the 9th, the Minister of Health of Malawi, Chitalu Chilumpha, said that the country had discovered its first three cases of Omskatoxin poisoning.
The country's health department conducted genetic sequencing on 12 new positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found three cases of infection.

"At the beginning, it was because of friends' introduction that I trusted them. So, I chose to have a look at the basic renovation of my house with a budget of 70,000 yuan."
A series of tricks begins as soon as you enter the store.
I went to the store just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't even go to the site to measure the house. They actually gave me a quote for my 135 m2 house for 70,000 yuan, and they didn't even show me their materials.
Their second scam is that you have to hand over the money as soon as you enter the shop (and you will never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
While hesitating about whether to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you can get if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of being cheated while alive. I deposited more than ten thousand yuan at the spur of the moment.
His quote had many problems. It did not include water and electricity reform, and did not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, which are major costs.
Their service fees are also higher than those of other home companies.
I lost trust in this company, and I will not sign the contract at all.
When I went to get my money back from them, they put up a very professional front, with a specialized team to deal with you.
No matter what, it's the customer's problem and they are entirely blameless.
There are all sorts of ways to shift the blame, and a lot of details, but it all comes down to the fact that you shouldn't choose them because my friend who hired them to do the renovation also had a bad experience with them and ended up paying a lot of extra costs.
Damn, they are the original dragon head decorations that deceived people, now turned into a beauty, as if closing and changing into something else.
So don't choose such a bad contractor.
Please provide the English translation of this sentence: Afterwards, everyone can look up these consultations when choosing, because decoration is not a small expense.

The night sky will usher in the Leonid meteor shower on the 14th. Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin December 12 wire (Reporter Zhou Rui Gen)天文科普专家 said that as the last large scale meteor shower this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who love meteor shower may observe in the night of December 14.
The Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu captured the Perseid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers come from periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is an asteroid, 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "born" from a comet.
According to Qi Hui, a council member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and a professional in popularizing astronomy, the Leonid meteor shower, which is most visible in the night sky in late November, will be visible from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its high flow rate and stability, and is called one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the Perseid meteor shower and the Orionid meteor shower.
A prominent feature of the双子座流星雨 is the slow speed of the meteoroids, rich colors, and many fireballs, which are both suitable for viewing and for beginning astronomical photography.
The photo of the Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin amateur astronomer Yang Jing on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin Binzhou.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions, with the radiant point located directly above the observer's head).

Last year's "falling star twins" left a deep impression on people, but this year's "falling star twins" will be affected by moonlight and the show will be a little disappointing.
On the 14th day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the moon is in the waxing gibbous phase, and the bright moonlight will interfere with observations. In the second half of the night, the moon will set, and at this time, the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also become relatively high.
Friends who enjoy meteor showers can observe them in the hours after the moon sets in the second half of the night, but they should be careful to stay warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a clear view to the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and wait patiently until the moon sets, then observe.
Note that the flow rate of双子座流星雨 is large in all directions. When observing, do not always focus on the radiation point of双子座流星雨.
If you like photography, you should choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture to shoot stunning "shooting stars" and use high ISO and the largest aperture when shooting.
"Based on stability and continuity, a tripod, backup battery, and emergency line are also indispensable."
Establish a prompt reminder.
What is the difference between a laser TV and a traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional television referred to by the topic should be liquid crystal television, and the difference between laser television and liquid crystal television in market position mainly includes the following two points:
First, laser TV will focus on the large screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of the liquid crystal TV, the laser TV clearly focuses on the large screen market, or it can be said that the laser TV is a product born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TV sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TVs in global production and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales in 80 inches and above.
According to Chunghwa Telecom's prediction, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for the good performance of the large screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the principle of laser television reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal TV, the imaging process is closer to the natural imaging process under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
A strict comparison experiment was conducted by the Optical Instrumentation Laboratory of the China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts of Beijing Calibration Hospital under the same population conditions to obtain 144 sets of test data for laser TVs and LCD TVs.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics, and in certain aspects, even have a certain improvement effect.
With the increasing attention to visual health, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the LED market.
Second, the laser TV focuses on the high-end market.
Conversely, the price of liquid crystal TVs has continued to decline. At present, the price of most laser TVs is above 10,000 yuan, and the price gradually rose as the size and light source were upgraded.
Why is this laser TV so expensive?
It is certainly true.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that liquid crystal TV and projectors cannot achieve.
Thanks to the ultra-short throw projection technology, the distance between the projector and the screen in the laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projectors. A 100-inch large screen can be achieved within a short distance, and the space required is small. In addition, the host is compact, and the occupied space is very small.
In terms of brightness, the high-end laser TVs can exceed 2000 nits.
With lower heating value, less equipment wear and tear, and longer TV lifespan.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and holographic screens, which can give users a more stunning visual and auditory experience.
Don’t talk about false demands, but the product of demand segmentation. Talk about picture quality and input-output ratio. Laser TV is not a dish for movie players. If you want to take both large screen and viewing environment into consideration, you can try. Everything has its pros and cons. You can decide for yourself after weighing the pros and cons. Don’t just listen to one side.
In simple terms, the ultra-wide near-focusing projector - laser TV, in order to close to the screen, must use expensive ultra-wide lenses and reflectors, which does not meet the best optical design.
In order to block some environmental light, a micro-structured Fresnel screen is used, which is expensive and can replace a 65-inch LCD screen with a 80-inch screen.
There is one more thing I want to say. I really dislike the way projector manufacturers boast about their lenses being able to project an image directly onto the retina. This is a selling point, but in reality, the light that is projected onto the screen is actually a direct light that shines directly onto the retina. If you project the light onto the ceiling, the eyes cannot see it. This is also true for liquid crystal TVs, which are also "directly" projected. When you open the TV, the screen is not illuminated, is it?
Moreover, the screen would not have been made at all if it were not for the mirror reflection.
The hotspots (light spots) of high gain curtains are completely ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes, which is really unbearable.
"Photography visual art photography gallery preferred quality store. There is currently no branch."
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the little sister sent me the available time schedule. The reply was prompt.
I watched the shooting works in the store before, and there are more outdoor wedding dresses. They are very beautiful, and the shooting style involved is also very many.
After the day arrived, I simply communicated my ideas to my sister, and with great patience, she helped me try on two sets of my style clothing. Finally, the make-up artist began to make up before the photographer took pictures. The photographer would arrange some props, guide the action, and pay attention to every detail.
"But it could be because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, so the outcome may not be the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking nonetheless 🙊🙊"
After the shooting, the photographer will help you choose photos, communicate post-production style, and feel very meticulous.
The repaired piece will be ready in about half a month. Please wait.
Second time hit write true king dining event ~ Most of the clothing in the scene can choose a photo.
Finally, she chose a black dress to experience different styles.
The entire shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer responsible for shooting is the photographer's younger brother who was born in the 90s. He felt a bit inexperienced, hoping to give more suggestions after the customer's shooting action guidance. The shooting process was quite enjoyable.
Visual art photography gallery preferred quality store
I'm on the homepage, let's take a look at Queenie~
"I filled in my name and phone number first, and then chose the clothing. The wedding dresses were all available, and I changed into three or four sets of clothes. The makeup was done for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. After taking photos, the photographer taught me how to pose, and the result was that my face looked much bigger. The editing said it would take half a month, and three or four days later, it arrived. It felt like there was no difference from the original photo."
The overall environment is good.
There are a lot of optional clothing.
The makeup area is just a few steps away, and the photography room is inside.
【Translation】Very enthusiastic and also very meticulous.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the action seriously.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will also actively request a retake.
【Experience】It may be a bit too exaggerated in shape. Previously, double eyelid skin was pasted on three eyelid skin.
The eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for someone who doesn't usually paint their eyebrows.
The photos were taken ten days ago, but the P-effect is not satisfactory. It feels like double eyelid tape is still very obvious.
"I'm not sure what style to choose. I tried two sets, but they didn't fit. So I chose the black suit. My sister said this set is more suitable for a vintage style."
"After selecting the clothing, I began to make up. The makeup artist and hairstylist sisters were extremely patient in helping me, and the results were very satisfactory."
"After doing my makeup, the photographer took control of my poses throughout the entire process. It was very smooth and harmonious."
After filming, he carefully chose four of his favorite cuts. The little brother said that the ending was very satisfactory.
It has been 3 days without a response... I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# monthly plan because your system cannot recognize my credit card.
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.

Buy an umbrella insurance, can it be trusted?
Little Rain Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of conditions, in accordance with the "Regulations of the Insurance Brokers" (2015 Amendment), to become an insurance broker, three key words must be met: shareholder, initiator has no major violations in the last 3 years, the minimum registered capital is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very stringent. In summary, it requires strength, approval from a national authoritative department of the country (which oversees all insurance companies and banks), and good corporate governance for shareholders as a small rain insurance for insurance brokers. Insurance buyers do not have to doubt whether small rain insurance is legal or not. After all, these three requirements are not something that any insurance company can achieve.
On this point, he is not wrong, it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, the small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies’ stars’ heavy diseases are sold on this platform. For example, the latest Thai Super Mario 5 heavy disease, the insurer and the insured are both Thai people. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no question about its credibility.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet products are generally priced higher than traditional products due to the absence of operating expenses and staff costs, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, which can alleviate the burden of premium payment for the insured, and at the same time, maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism: this is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires strong professionalism. Many Internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to many errors. In health and occupational fields, non-insurance professionals often add their subjective awareness when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or qualified. This easily leads to many hidden risks of claims, which may be rejected.
I used to work at “Tencent Weibao” (an internet insurance brokerage platform, just like little umbrella) and sold insurance over the phone. I can assure you that I am very responsible.
The insurance on the Internet is true and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable. The Internet channels do not have professional staff, and there are many sales misleads.
For example, 6 million yuan of insurance can be bought for 1 yuan, and 60,000 yuan of serious illness insurance can be obtained for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are light on the details and do not inform the insured person that the first month’s premium is 1 yuan, and the subsequent months’ premiums are normal and range from dozens to 200 yuan. Many customers are unclear about the fees they pay for themselves for one or two years.
Thinking they could spend 1 yuan, the insurance company compensated 6 million (a drop in the bucket).
Free mobile phone is sent when the policy number is special, such as 6666 and 8888. And if the winning message is sent, the winner will not exchange and no one will remind.
This is another problem for the insured. The free 60,000-yuan serious illness insurance is only for a short period. If there are no other commercial risks, and if a serious illness really occurs, 60,000 yuan will not be enough to solve the problem, and the rest of life will begin to live in poverty.
There is also a crackdown on mis-selling of online insurance.
So, all in all, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem lies with the professionalism and professional ethics of business staff.
It is suggested that the topic be carefully considered. In fact, many underground insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products and more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and the cost-effectiveness of some products is better than that of online products.
I have helped 59 internet customers and guaranteed offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Mingyu Insurance Broker with over 3 years of experience in business management training. I have served nearly 1,000 enterprise users and collaborated with over 100 insurance companies. Before placing an insurance policy, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for each customer. During the insurance placement process, I will strive to obtain the best underwriting result for the customer, and after the insurance policy is placed, I will help the customer with the insurance billing and management, so that the customer can rest assured.
Growing together with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business that allows the insured to complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor also does not need to sign. All steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although there is no "ceremonial" feel to the insurance provided by the Internet, and even the printed version of the paper contract may not be available, this in no way affects the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic contract.
This pattern is somewhat similar to a call center workflow, but buying insurance this way also has a fatal problem, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we purchase insurance, should we not seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is one that will accompany us for a long time and provide services for us even many years later?

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and insult, and I cannot accept such physical attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this evil.
If we don't resist the parties and factions that should be resisted first, it is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the beginning of your Facebook friend request, followed by posts of a derogatory nature, to your attempt to publish my home address and father's name on social media, I have adopted an attitude of no response.
"After you left, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of one day six meals, but also continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some ambiguous and humiliating remarks about me, such as appearance, figure, good nutrition, and other bedside conversations, such as whether to insert strawberries or not. I... have had enough."
How do I know later I received more friends' messages about your Facebook friend's uploading a photo of you and specific harassing words?
I'm sorry, but as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I uploaded the news that I reported, you didn't calm down at all but became even more agitated.
I don't care about your political background or social status, respect for both genders is necessary in our society.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of playful, implicit, humiliating, and degrading language, you can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even deny that it is not your doing or continue to make all attacking remarks.
"No, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you."
Neither do I know you, nor do I want to know you, my appearance and figure are none of your business.
I don't think there is any girl who would want to humiliate themselves to such an extent just for fame.
A friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said okay, you won't believe it.
I don't think any woman could be so cruel and still feel good about themselves.
Only those who lack basic decency would choose to harm any woman in this way, whether in the workplace, society, politics or business.
I believe that human nature is inherently free.
I cut off part of my message for everyone to think about.
Your post should not be imitated by others.
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.
With a smile in one's heart.
Vietnam People's News Agency - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the third forum on the development of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam.
Two main meetings were held during the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, which discussed topics around digital technology enterprises and the country's digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and the economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Information Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the number of digital technology enterprises and their revenue in Vietnam continued to grow, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam typically produces a large number of digital products, solving major problems facing Vietnam, many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.

Digital transformation should involve the establishment of databases related to the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, and national characteristics, in order to promote digital transformation in the banking, taxation, land management and development, and logistics sectors.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Premier Van Ming demands that governments at all levels, agencies, and enterprises must increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve systems related to digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, proactivity, and initiative.

The platform expected that "Kearsarge" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the aircraft carrier "Kearsarge" has deployed F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" tilt-rotor aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is also currently cruising in the Pacific.
The "Lincoln" also for the first time embarked F-35C aircraft, which belongs to the 314th Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the United States Navy currently deploys the "Ronald Reagan" aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Shangpula Lake" missile frigate and the "Stockdale" missile escort.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform" published the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo@南海战略态势感知) The three US aircraft carriers gather around China and the most powerful weapons rarely visit the island. On January 17, 2022, the US military aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy arms depot visited the island last weekend.
The Russian nuclear-powered submarine "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The gathering of the three US aircraft carriers in the waters around China is a rare visit by the world's most powerful weapons. Analysts said that this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to the island since 2016 and the second public visit since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers gathered in the waters around China, which is a rare visit for the world's most powerful weapons. China has built a large number of military facilities on the Nansha Islands in recent years.
"图" refers to Hainan Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy stated in a declaration that the visit of the Russian nuclear-powered submarine "Nevsky" to the Diaoyu Islands has strengthened cooperation between the United States and regional allies, demonstrating the United States' capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called the "thunderboat" (Boomer submarine).
The whereabouts of the 14 submarines of the US Navy's "Silent Service" are usually closely guarded secrets.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine has made the "Thunderboat" become the "most important survival weapon" in the "nuclear triad", which also includes the missile silo-based missiles in the United States, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock and the $251 billion wiped off its market value, Zuckerberg responded by saying that the company was facing "unprecedented competition". Why?
"Meta (Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with the majority of its revenue coming from advertising. It is one of the advertising companies that makes money today, with its own flow channels."
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, regardless of their positioning functions, are all Meta traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps outside of Meta advertise through Meta's advertising platform to achieve realization.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to access users' data information, which has affected the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly and provides a clear indication to users whether the app is allowed to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not to allow it.
The next time Google slices the pie, it will have an even greater impact on Meta's revenue.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is inaccurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from companies based in China that contribute to its maritime business.
Meta has an office in Hong Kong with about 200 employees and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be ignored. Most of the money goes to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta earned a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agencies are helping ByteDance go to Meta, and Meta’s performance in the Chinese market is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it certainly won't be better than before.
Chinese companies' large-scale burning of cash overseas has passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new flow channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market looks not only at current income but more importantly at future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not met.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "metaverse".
The metaverse indeed should be one of the future directions, but the realization period of the metaverse is relatively long. This story should not support the market value of Meta in these two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a challenging period for Meta.
Don't look now, but Facebook is a very flashy $100 billion to $200 billion business every year and is in the midst of a very real crisis, with no safe moat around it compared to other internet companies and tech firms.
Although his several social software are quite popular now and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence, and the competition is just a eye-dazzling show.
And the concept of the metaverse, which is desirable but unattainable, has no hope of success in the short term, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and constantly seeks new business opportunities. However, I think his business choice is wrong, it is a dead-end road. This is my thinking, for reference.
