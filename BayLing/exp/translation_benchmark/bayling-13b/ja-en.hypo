I don't feel like watching TV at all...
Is it unreasonable for me to become an idol? Aren't idols just for TV?
Yesterday, at Netflix, I saw a thousand birds, but there were many scenes where the staff were laughing in the background.
It's not that I don't want to say it clearly, but "I'm just saying it because I want to sell it" is a ridiculous reason.
But if you don't laugh at the staff's jokes, you're not human.
Back in the day, when I wanted to be a black entrepreneur, I was the only one in that industry, and my ego was so big that I thought I could act like a regular person, but I couldn't.
On the one hand, there are many people who think that "it's better to get rid of yokai" while feeling proud of their own work.
Although the income is quite small until you become a salesperson, I want to become a salaried employee with a respectable job title as soon as possible.

The item I ordered at Tokyu Hands was replaced without notice
Warranty: If you order a wireless mouse, its wired version will also be sent, and if you hope to return it, you can return it.
It's not just a problem with self-published PC games, but I can't think of any well-known examples, so I'll leave it at that.
It was announced that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (Rakuten) from the previous day of the week.
Since the wired version was the same price as the wireless version at the store, I ordered the wired version after confirming the price.
The normal purchase order mail came in, and the next-day shipping mail also arrived.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" is written in both of these emails and in the purchase history of the page.
Because there was no delivery miscommunication or cancellation notice from the delivery company from the time the order was placed, the wireless mouse that was ordered eventually arrived.
It was at this point that an email arrived saying that there was a "discrepancy in the registration of the goods".
According to that email
It was advertised as a wireless version, but it was actually a wired version.
Since we have already shipped the wired mouse,
1. Cancel all reservations
2. Return the mouse only for a refund
3. Use the wired mouse in the same way
and respond to them.
The product page for the wired and wireless versions are distinguishable, and the order history and invoice also show the wireless version, so it would be better to replace it with the wired version.
The product I bought and the one I received do not match. Can I return it and get my money back?
Finally, I would like to ask for advice on how to deal with this situation.

Second degree also isolated... The only bridge to the area is washed away by the typhoon and heavy rain. Residents are stocking up on food three times more than usual in Ofunato, Iwate Prefecture (Fuji TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Matsumoto, a resident of the highland area of Higashimuki, Fukushima prefecture.
The typhoon that had a significant impact on 8 people in their 30s was the台風 that hit East Japan in 2019.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first, it was like 'Wow, a magician.'
Whether it collapses or not, whether it flows or not, such thoughts came one after another. The only way to reach the Higashidani area, the "Higashidani Bridge", was swept away by the typhoon and 30 people in the 11th and 30s in the area were isolated.
The residents, whose water supply had been severed, had to continue to carry out their daily lives using a JR iron bridge that is usually open to traffic.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "If the train comes normally, we can pick up the car with our hands, or carry it on our backs while walking on the iron bridge until we arrive here. However, the means of transportation and the inconvenience of the car were felt." The emergency bridge that was completed in one month was washed away by a heavy rain just three months later. It became isolated again for several days.
It has been two years since the disaster, but Matsumoto continues to teach us how to deal with the aftermath.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "I think there are about 10 cases."
First of all, we want to make sure that we have enough food for 2 to 3 days, such as instant noodles, cup ramen, and other non-perishable foods that can be eaten even if there is no refrigeration.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "I couldn't understand when the disaster would strike my own body. So, I thought it would be better to make a little preparation and get ready for unexpected disasters." On the other hand, archery village, which has experienced "unexpected disasters".
In order not to forget the lesson, the town began to take the initiative from 2021.
Yamagata City, Yamagata Prefecture, Director of the Disaster Prevention Education Center, Hiroaki Hashigami said, "We have decided to designate October 12th as 'Yamagata City Disaster Prevention Day' in the form of 'Yamagata City Disaster Prevention Day' and we will issue a press release."
I think that awareness has been heightened that things beyond our expectations might occur."

The collapse of the "building status survey system" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
Aiming at the activation of the ancient residential market, the newly established "building status survey" system is conducive to the attraction of ancient residential houses.
Housing construction and mansion prices are rising, and the reform market is also expanding.
On the one hand, as the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus increases, words such as "stay-at-home," "quarantine," "towers," and "large-scale" have become popular, and relatively safe new structures have been reduced.
[View the image of this article] However, compared to overseas, the existing (ancient) housing circulation share in Japan is still stuck at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) started a survey aimed at promoting the extraction of safe and secure mid-aged houses, which is called a survey of building conditions, or inspection (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system that allows a skilled builder to check the current condition of the building, including the deterioration of items, and report it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that there are benefits for both buyers and sellers through the introduction of inspection.
The seller can avoid claims after the purchase by having the item appraised before selling it. This gives buyers peace of mind.
This means that it can be used to differentiate competing substances.
On the one hand, for the buyer, it is a system that allows you to grasp the status of the second-hand housing you plan to purchase, and you can purchase it if you like. It is a great system to see at first glance.
In the current system, the right to conduct building status surveys is primarily held by the seller.
In addition, it should be noted that until now, only notification of an inspection system has been mandatory.
Specifically, the obligation of the real estate broker who serves as an intermediary in the sale of real estate is to "introduce a construction engineer to conduct a building status survey" or "cannot" do so, but the implementation of it is not obligated.
On the other hand, when looking overseas, in active markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, similar systems are already in place.
In the pre-purchase stage of housing, a system is in place where the buyer requests a building inspection from professionals known as "inspectors" or "building surveyors."
For example, in the case of the United States, inspections are carried out to the extent of 70-90% of historic homes.
Until now, the point at which the "buyer" leads the inspection is greatly different from that of the "seller" mainstream inspection in the Japanese style.
The seller's side would like to show the condition of the building as much as possible, as high and early as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer is considering purchasing with confidence by reviewing the content of the survey and making appropriate revisions.
Even with the same inspection, the purpose and thinking of both parties are different.
Therefore, the following points have been raised as concerns for the Japanese system.
The scope of the inspection for the designated primary dealers determined by the country is limited to a minimum.
Because there is no detailed investigation, there is a risk of missing important discrepancies. For inspection companies, affiliate companies (sellers) that introduce cases are also possible customers.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an "inspection with a twist" that reports unfavorable results to the seller is carried out.

Was Ginza an island?
5 Secrets to Talking About Money While Married (LEON.JP - Yahoo! News)
Yeah, it used to be a peninsula.
Such evidence ... ... "so we can reveal it as soon as possible if we find it."
I will introduce the knowledge of soybeans at Ginza to you.
Go up to the rooftop! ?
First submarine
As you walk around Ginza, you can find remnants of the history of the area, such as the changing names of the streets, the mysterious stone monuments, and the many shops.
While walking with her daughter and passing through Ginza, she unintentionally visited a quiet place and thought to herself, "Ah, this used to be a half-island."
Wasn't Kowloon a peninsula?
In Japanese cities, "○○ Ginza" has become a synonym for prosperity, like the "Ginza" in Tokyo Central Ward.
In the same way, "Ginza" is the place where coins are minted, and in 1612 (the 17th year of Keicho), the Ginza coin mint, which is now located in Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
Although it was called "New Yokkaichi" at that time, it became known as "Ginza" when it was moved to Yokkaichi.
As a result, the area near Ginza became a "semi-island".
Until the Edo period, Edogawa was separated from Marunouchi by a moat, and a semi-island extending from Nihonbashi to Ginza had been developed.
Its cutting edge is now in Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the Edo shogunate, dug the moat around Edo, and advanced the preparations in the Kyobashi area.

Those who know will know the "Holy Land Pilgrimage" of Ginza.
The "Ginza Hachiman Shrine" is a "sacred land pilgrimage" that is held every year in Ginza.
In more than 10 sacred sites, the most eye-catching is probably the "Kagura Shrine" located before the Kagura dance.
There are few people who do not go to the theater before and after the performance of the troupe standing at the right end of the stage.
On the one hand, "Dragon-shaped jade that does not move" is located on the rooftop of the Matsuya department store, while "The dragon born in the world" is located on the 9th floor of the Mitsukoshi department store.
The "Takayama Hie Shrine" and "Aizu Hie Shrine" and "Hitachi Hie Shrine" are located in the depths of the road, and are not particularly well-known. "Hitachi Hie Shrine", which is famous for its dance and song, is located in the 1st floor entrance of the Sun Life Plaza Building. "Success Hie Shrine", which is not open to the public except for during the Bon Festival, is located in the same building.
Around this shrine, there are things such as Emperors and Kannon, but most shrines offer incense to the gods.
The "Harvest Society" in front of the shrine, which welcomes foxes, was built because there are many farmers in the area and foxes are good at pest control.
As a result, in major cities such as Kyoto and Tokyo, where prosperity is said to be thriving, faith has become extinct in Japan's bustling streets and Ginza as well.

South Korea's Posco International buys Chevron's Texaco energy business, expands overseas gas field operations = South Korean report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International on the 12th entered into a share purchase agreement with Senex Energy, Hancock Energy and Senex Energy for investment.
Now, the process of obtaining approval from the shareholders' association of SENEC and the local corporation is still ongoing. The acquisition process is scheduled to be completed by next March.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition price was 77.9 billion yen, and among these, Posco International invested 50.1%, while Hancock Energy invested 49.9%.
LNG International said that the demand for natural gas will continue to increase in the era of energy transformation, and blue hydrogen, which is the foundation of natural gas in the hydrogen market, will divide the market with green hydrogen. They said that they have decided to buy this time.
Posco International will secure 8020 million cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas storage capacity, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, and hire local land-based gas field operators in Chongqing.

That knee pain, maybe "deforming knee joint disease"! ?
Different treatments for the same reason (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor: Recently, my knee has been hurting.
What kind of diseases are possible?
Mr. Maruyama: The cause of pain in the knee joint is various, such as knee osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout.
Not only that, but the most common cause of arthritis among Japanese is "deforming osteoarthritis".
Editing department: Is it true that the bracket will deform?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which serves to absorb shock and make the movement of the joint smooth.
However, osteoporosis, obesity, and intense sports are among the reasons why bones may become weakened or deformed.
This results in inflammation and joint deformities.
Department of Orthopedics: Is deforming arthrosis limited to the knee joint?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
It can also occur in the wrist, finger joints and tendons, as well as the knee, ankle, and Achilles tendon.
However, the most common cause is a "deforming knee joint disease".
Editing department: So, what kind of structure does the conjunction take?
Mr. Maruyama: "The joint is made up of two bones that are stacked on top of each other."
And the part that faces each other in these two bones is covered with "articular cartilage", and the surrounding area of the joint is wrapped with "articular capsule".
Department of Editing: It's a complicated structure.
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule is called the synovial tissue, and synovial fluid is produced.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate.
It is said that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing joint movements.
Department of Editing: What kind of symptoms occur when a flexion deformity occurs?
Mr. Maruyama said, "Ligaments are elastic and have a role to play because bones do not directly touch each other."
In other words, a role like a cup.
However, if it becomes inflamed or deformed, it can cause pain.
Do you sleep in pajamas?

Actually experienceable "Kaiji" series game 3 selections (real sound) - Yahoo! News
The popular manga series "Kaiji" that centers on the explosive popularity of the male protagonist.
One of the delights of this work is that it is a game to the death.
【Truth】 Seeing is believing... ... Take on the Iron Man challenge!
Therefore, this time we would like to examine a game of Kaji that is actually playable or is a practical animation.
It is a pachinko machine that made its debut in the pachinko parlor "Gambling Debt Repayment Cafe".
In the original, he was startled by the cage at a high rate of 14000 rpm.
This "bog" has been trapped by a large "trap" of "Hunting Ground", "Movable Object" and "3-stage Clean", making it almost impossible to approach.
Kaji, on the other hand, came up with a plan to place a vinyl-coated water trough on the ground floor of the building, after having tried every other possible means.
The "puddle" that appeared in Cage is actually a pachinko game, and many people are playing it.
It is not the case that things like "a 4000 yen" are becoming easier, but it is possible to understand the mood of Kai.
The "STARSIDE PARTY", which was held as a charity event for the leftover donations of the victims of the Kumamoto earthquake, is a "passage of human horse racing".
The debtor works to avoid falling over the narrow iron framework installed 10 meters above the ground while advancing, competing with that speed.
12 people participated, and the top two can win the prize. However, there are only four iron bones, and the safety measures are inadequate, and the possibility of death is also quite high.
This iron bridge is high risk, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is also possible to experience a close feeling at "Eugluru Bridge" installed at the home ground of professional baseball team, Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi".
This bridge, with a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), has a single steel bridge that protrudes, and "Skylight" and "Victory Bridge" are intended to be used before it.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Coala, the intelligent language assistant, made a video of herself walking on the Ingubridge and published it on her own YouTube, which became a topic.
E-Card 2-player card game, "E-Card".
The emperor's card is 1 piece, the citizen's card is 8 pieces, and the slave's card is 1 piece, for a total of 10 pieces, which are divided into the emperor's side and the slave's side.
This game is very good, and the emperor is strong towards citizens, citizens are strong towards slaves, and slaves are strong towards the emperor.
Kaiji takes on the harsh rule of "if you lose, you will have your ears cut off" to challenge Ryugan in the drama.
Kaji, who had sensed that the device that could break the ear like an iPhone and transmit changes in heart rate and body temperature was reading the psychology, won by making the opponent's body go abnormal values to the limit.
The E-card can be purchased at retail and Amazon, for example.
Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, has uploaded an animation video in which he defeats Kai in the movie and E-card, and has become a topic.
Do you want to try feeling the Kaij spirit?
No one wants to experience the same thing as Kaji, but it is also a fact that reading manga makes you feel that way.
You have to experience that worldview by playing the game.
One step towards the new year, beautifully following up with a visit to the shrine | Yamagata News
In Yamagata Prefecture, where the New Year's decorations are in full swing, a large "Torii" (shrine gate) for next year's "Torii" (shrine gate) appeared.

The large scroll measures 3.3 meters wide and the center height is approximately 1.8 meters.
Tsuchiya described it as "an image of going into the new year with a positive image of a cherry blossom".
I stopped in my tracks and gazed at the cherry blossoms, praying to be able to find beauty in a world that is constantly changing.

A discovery of a new way to fold origami (The Asahi Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
It's a stool that won't leave you out in the cold during winter, but can you manage without a backrest?
It's a good idea to adjust the balance while looking through the viewfinder, but I couldn't understand how to do it.
As soon as I saw the stool, which was neatly stacked, I thought that... and found something new.
The stool of the brand "COTTIERI" has a height of about 1 meter and a more compact size than general stools.
When I first saw it I thought 'how long is this going to be?
On closer inspection, it can be seen that the fabric has been cut into thin strips and arranged to form a web-like pattern.
In the web's case, the end of the stool is now able to pass through.
Therefore, you can connect the ends and fasten them with a knot.
The fabric is very light and warm.
This year, the best-selling jacket without sleeves (vest) is popular, but those who wear it should combine it with a stole to keep their arms warm.
Having such a stool, I think it would be very convenient.

Massive damage in the United States: The impact of seasonal warmth and strong cold air (WEATHER News) - Yahoo! News
A series of earthquakes hit central America from the night of the 10th (Thursday) until the 11th (Friday).
During this period, a strong cold front moved south, causing the atmosphere to become very unstable and allowing the clouds to develop rapidly.
Warm air flowing in from the Southwest brought record-breaking warmth to the Southwest.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature on the 9th (Tuesday) and 10th (Wednesday) of the local time is close to 30 degrees.
In such a record-breaking warm atmosphere, a strong cold front with temperatures below -30℃ near 5500m has moved southward, and an active front has been formed due to a large temperature difference, and云s are rapidly developing along the front.
It is believed that accidents occurred one after another.
The southern United States is a region where earthquakes are likely to occur, but large-scale damage does not often occur during the period from the beginning of summer to autumn.
The blizzard warning issued on the day of the winter solstice reached 150 times close and set a record.
There were reports of whales and typhoons, among others, in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of America.
As a result, two concentrated areas are found in the southern line from Kentuck to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kumamoto Prefecture, the intensity of the earthquake, which was indicated by the seismic scale (Kumamoto scale), reachedEF3, which is the third strongest level, and a momentary gust of wind of 70 m/s before and after the earthquake was observed.
In future surveys, the possibility of an EF4 or 5 rating will also be considered.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the improved Nakayama scale) that matches the situation of Japanese buildings is used.
The magnitude of this week's earthquake in America is equivalent to JEF3, which also occurs in Japan. The level of wooden houses collapsing is high.

A voice asking for help from the "biggest robbery in history" will be broadcast live (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the damage caused by the tsunami in the central and southern part of Miyagi prefecture, the governor of Miyagi prefecture said on the 11th (Japanese time on the 12th), "This is one of the largest tsunamis in the history of Miyagi prefecture." He said it with awe.
As reported by CNN television, for example.
Mr Biden stressed that "anything is possible" for the federal government.
The full extent of the damage caused, such as who had lost their lives, was not yet known, he said.
Fears of more than 100 dead have arisen.
In the earthquake-stricken Kumamoto Prefecture, aftershocks continued for 10 nights and 11 days from the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th, with at least 30 aftershocks occurring in at least six prefectures, including Kumamoto.
The record for the area of damage caused by the tsunami in the Miyagi prefecture in 1925, which had a length of 219 miles (approximately 350 kilometers), has been preserved, but experts at CNN have also estimated that the maximum size was around 250 miles (approximately 400 kilometers).
In the large earthquake-stricken area of Kumamoto, Japan, factories that continued operations around the clock during the Christmas holiday were also greatly damaged.
At that time, 110 people were working, but the building was damaged and no trace was left.
In the darkness, a woman who had become immobile under the rubble of about 1.5 meters in thickness, felt the weight of the rescuer who came to search for her on the rubble. She called for help from her smartphone to Facebook Live.
The live broadcast included the sound of women calling for help, as well as the sound of crying and other women screaming in terror, "Happy Birthday To You" could also be heard.
Ann Brown, a convenience store clerk who lives in the field, was trapped in the cellar of her home with her 5-year-old son by a gas leak but was uninjured.
The person who provided the example of the train sound said "Although there are many people who provide examples of the sound of the train, there are also some scary sounds like earthquakes."
Police officials in Mayfield Heights said the search will continue until it is no longer necessary.
We don't know whether it will take one week, one month or one year.
At least six people were confirmed dead after an Amazon warehouse in Illinois collapsed.

What kind of doctor specializes in obstetrics and gynecology?
An endocrinologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of hormone-related disorders and typically practices for 3 to 5 years after residency.
It is also called "specialist doctor" and "postgraduate doctor".
In other words, "resident doctor" refers to "初期研修医" (initial residency doctor), which refers to doctors in their first and second year of residency.
If not experienced, it means inexperienced, but since it is possible to become proficient in 4 to 5 years, various tasks are assigned.

It is an old saying that the evaluation system of the star rating is different.
Against this, Japan is claiming that it will reduce the number of stars from five to three as a neutral standard.
There is a 2-star difference at the reference point, and a 4-star difference between "a work with subtraction elements" and "a masterpiece".
Since works that "have no flaws apart from that" and "the best works in each case" are placed in the same column when the maximum rating of 5 is set as the standard, if there is a tendency towards such a direction, it would be a flaw in the system that does not suggest the meaning of the star. However, since such a system is now in use, it would be better not to give 3 stars (a negative rating).
Therefore, people who claim this hand are trying to refute the Steam review.

The catch-of-the-day "autumn fish and abalone sashimi made at home"
The colorful salad and delicious rice bowl from the specialty restaurant "Hakubun" that used fresh vegetables.
So that our customers can also enjoy the atmosphere of a restaurant," said Mr. and Mrs. Higashimura (39) and (38) who opened last August.
One of the popular menu items is "Grilled autumn fish and abalone, homemade tartar sauce" (1,000 yen).
Fish choose the good things in the market from time to time.
Fry's "The ingredient tastes good" (Yoshikazu) and Ebi-Fry's "The ingredient tastes delicious" were accurately conveyed.
The main dish is grilled trout from Shizuoka prefecture, which is paired with a variety of seasonal vegetables and a bowl of steaming rice.
Wild vegetables are made into pickles or sold at local markets.
The side dish varies depending on the season, but fortunately, Ms. Komatsu has learned French cuisine, and sauces such as rape and ratatouille are added.
On the one hand, there is a "taste that makes you want to eat a lot" (Yamamoto) and a wide range of generations are enjoying it.

Specifically, I thought it would be good to make my own lane and avoid the demon of the person walking ahead of me.
However, as it is now, I think it would be better if there were fewer people.

The man who fled was a middle-aged skinhead.
A weapon believed to have been used in the crime was found near the scene.
The man had been drinking with friends and was believed to have been hit by a vehicle, possibly a bicyclist.

A family that has rooted environmental protection activities in the Chinese countryside (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuji Kato: Hong Kong Enterprise Find Asia Consultant) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, and the number of species of mammals and plants is ranked first and third in the world respectively.
Autonomous entities recognize the value of biodiversity, and not only do they engage in environmental protection, but they also promote the activities of environmental activists in certain regions.
Sichuan Province, located in southwestern China, is also one of those areas.
Her older sister, Li Yingying, is now active as an actress. Sichuan is a region that connects Laos and Myanmar, where the Thai ethnic group, which shares the same language and culture as Thailand, is dominant and where many ethnic minorities live.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through various Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The autonomous region of the Tibetan people in China (Tibet) has an area of only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants are living there.
This time, I had the opportunity to meet Lee Soon-geun, who is carrying out environmental protection activities in Chiang Rai, and learned about the content of his activities.
I started environmental protection activities together with my German husband 20 years ago.
What kind of thing was that?
Our environmental protection activity "Teng Fei" has been launched since 2000.
His name is Josef Margraf.
Her husband is German, and he came to Kobe to work on a joint scientific project with the United States and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and has been praised for its biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development has been delayed.
Therefore, in order to establish industry in this area, gum production that was insufficient in China was advanced by large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforests.
The husband was dispatched from Germany to here for the return of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
And I know the reporter here, and it's because we got married.
I don't think Mr. Lee had any interest in environmental protection before.
"Mr. Li, although I am of Chinese descent, I have no interest in the importance and diversity of tropical rainforests."
As a result, she has been promoting the project with her husband without any knowledge.
It's not because their faces are clean, nor because they have high cheekbones that I look at them, but why do I think this?
Someone once said.
Orra is not something that will come out as planned.
In an instant when you believe in yourself, you naturally become a confident person.

Is that so?

I don't think so.
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Can you please rephrase?
I'm not sure if I should be flattered or not.
What would you do if you confessed your love to Yoshida-kun?

【おま環／個人的備忘】MOD自環境でCTDの原因となっていて、約1か月半同定に時間がかかったもの
CTD, which had occurred several times due to multiple factors since GW, resumed during the holidays.
Was it because you couldn't analyze the log with .NET Script Framework (if so, it should be easy to figure out)? A part of the error related to the .dll series and mesh is left in the crash log.
Timing of the main CTD
No trace is left in the logs of all papyrus and .NET Script Framework plugins, as well as the type of .dll plugins that leave a trace.
When an NPC kills/attacks accumulate: Console kill also triggers → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ PowerOfThree's updated version) OFF improves ※ Is this related to the possibility of clothes?
When the camera work for the NPC is activated, the "Kilmubu Setting OFF" is set to "OFF" via the ini file and basic improvements are made: Is this setting collision with the DAR + Nemesis relationship? However, the maximum number of DAR animation is 10,000.
(Basic House Outside) While moving in the field + casting a spell (e.g. Freezing Runes), when an NPC is hit, Dirt & Blood 2.0's SPID utilization NPC setting (MCM's upper right) will be OFF for 5 continuous attempts, and all improvements will be made.
Is it because of the additional protective gear or body mesh shader settings for NPCs? By the way, the default.ini for SPID 2.0 has a syntax error, but the intended result is that the NPCs have the appropriate perks applied.
At first, I focused on positional attacks and OnHit-related motion/battle MODS (those using .dll files), but the results were not as expected.
At least in English or German, French levels, similar bug reports were not found.
If there are many people who are struggling with similar CTD questions in a Japanese language environment, it would be great if you could submit it as a reference.
Cutting and pasting like a pro,
I had no idea, my colleague was also from the Oroka family.
When you look back on it, it's amazing how carefree and busy that person looks.
So he must be mentally unstable.
While I didn't retire because of the mental strain, I thought the limit had been reached just before my retirement.
Thinking about the importance of mental health consultations - today's consultation has ended
Although I have a bipolar disorder, I have been receiving long-term follow-up care, and I believe that the nurse (female) at the follow-up care station, which I am currently using, has a good relationship with me.
I'll talk to you every week.
Although I can do things necessary for dementia management (such as integrated care), I thought about how much more important it is for people with dementia to have enjoyable communication.
We discussed a variety of topics, including a survey on gender differences between men and women and some gender-related issues.
"So, what do you think about men and women's sexual desires? Why did they get a divorce? Should we ask them directly?"
Well, I have also cross-dressed.
However, in cases where a psychiatric ward has a visiting nurse station, a nurse who is not working in the ward and does not respond to business-like inquiries from the visiting nurse arrives, and when a therapeutic nurse comes, they are instructed in a perfunctory manner, such as "You are a nurse because you are practicing medicine." I have heard from people.
Although the small consultation room I am using is operated by a social welfare corporation, I feel that the psychiatrists who treat me and others with mental disorders are very good doctors.
Just kidding, you're beautiful.
Those who are receiving psychiatric care and those who are considering receiving it should come.
Talking to a mental health professional can be especially helpful for those with mental illness.
Please let the doctor decide.
So, let's choose a good question to ask the pharmacist.
In the past, I would have objected regardless, but I have also terminated the contract from here.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I know what a false alarm is, but I translated it into English.
Why did you write it in English?
There are several reasons and things that come to mind, for example...
I don't know if the person who made it is expressing something in Japanese.
Mismatch in language determination.
・The settings of the browser have been changed to prioritize English.
The ranking with the fewest occurrences of the number 6 is all odd.
Why do odd numbers always come up?
It's unthinkable.
There is some kind of pattern.

However, I cannot focus on work if I am at home.
I'm about to sneeze, I'll touch my nose right away.

South Korea's yttrium technology patent, China's 5% of 1... "Late delivery of yttrium supply map" (Central Daily News Japanese version) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government published a uranium supply map in 2019.
It aimed to popularize fuel cell vehicles with a total of 65,000 units by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The goal for the price of water is set at 6000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, in November this year, fuel cell vehicles did not meet the target of 27% (around 17,000 units).
The schedule for promoting the hydrogen station, which is a core infrastructure, is also a target of 38% (around 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is the same as when the loading map was announced, with a difference of 840,000 yen per station.
It has been revealed that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap fulfillment status has significantly decreased.
The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFC) issued a report entitled "The Status Quo and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy" on the 12th day of the month.
According to the report, the core components and raw materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan, among others.
The core materials of fuel cells for automobiles, such as carbon, are provided by Mitsubishi Materials (Japan), Kawasaki (Japan), Dupont (U.S.), Goya (Japan) and 3M (U.S.).
The number of patents for water technology in the six countries that dominate the global market for water (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% annually (from 2014 onwards).
In terms of the number of patents for hydrogen production and fuel cell technology (cumulative from 2001 to 2020), South Korea ranked fifth in the world.
However, it was conveyed that "in fact, six countries account for more than half of the world's uranium market, and in reality, they are ranked below the competing countries."
The order of patents in each country is as follows: China, the United States, EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States to become number one, and has widened the gap.
The number of registered patents in 2020 saw South Korea overtaking Japan (974 cases) to rank fourth with 1,033 cases, but China (4,721 cases) accounted for 22% of the total.
The Komeito Party proposed that "water technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large scope of equipment investment and research and development tax exemption."
He cut the tendon and had surgery for half a month.
I am now in rehabilitation, but the surgical scar is a bit inflamed, and it hurts when I move my hand.

Today, the PS5 sold 70,000 at the store.
It is appropriate.
Since it is a free competition, for example, when the price of Brand A is higher than that of Brand B,
For example, it is appropriate for a painter to become famous and for the price of their work to increase.
If Ps5 is sold at a high price, it is only because the price has increased from the fixed price.

Takasaki City Council is trying to create a unique council reform by preparing a quirky ordinance proposal and introducing a "communication notebook" for citizens to evaluate councilors.
Municipal assembly elections are held in three continuous phases in order to win the support of citizens.
In order to publicize the meeting held on the 12th day of the month, a press conference was held on the 9th day of the month and 1,800 copies of a new chirashi were distributed.
“Morning Dew” “Philosopher’s Room” “Detective Conan Series”…
The resolution adopted by the town meeting on the 9th is a chirashi that does not mention the popular TV program name.

Arms and aid from the US have arrived in Ukraine for military exercises (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) The US State Department said weapons, including small arms and ammunition, based on a aid plan approved by President Yushchenko, have arrived in Ukraine.
The military aid amounted to 60 million dollars (approximately 680 million yen), and the final equipment, which included radar for identifying launch sites such as missile launchers, was delivered to Ukraine.
According to a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Defense, weapons such as the anti-tank missile "Javelin," which is lethal, were also included in these aid.
The military support is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the reinforcement of troops by the Russian army around the perimeter of Ukraine.
Japan has strengthened its warning against Russia's military actions and has consulted with NATO allies and agreed to respond to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
The Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1 this year, and at that time, weapons assistance was approved.
Japan's military support to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of around 45 million dollars.
Since Russia's forced annexation of Crimea, the total amount of aid provided has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The Japanese army also served as training instructors for the Ukrainian army.
In the previous month, the United States sent soldiers from Florida, which had received support from Ukraine, to participate in a joint training exercise.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Defense of Japan, the European Union's Meta operation is playing a significant role with the training and assistance of Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is not known.
On the 7th of this month, President Poroshenko of Ukraine had an online meeting with President Putin of Russia, but the situation in Ukraine has become tense.
Japan is also considering imposing harsh economic sanctions.

Abe's predecessor as prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, and the former head of the tax agency, Shoichi Nakagawa, were also criticized for their handling of the gift money scandal.
The first feature of the December 18 issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talk with your family at the end and start of the year!"
Continuing the Tradition of Giving and Taking in Life and Death".
As the integration of gift and tax discussions progresses, the 2022 tax reform outline, which was announced, provides for the abolition of the gift tax. However, in the near future, there is a high possibility that the previous gift tax, which was a path for the inheritance tax, will become "prohibited".
What will change with the interlocking rules?
In addition to the direct hit on the former tax committee chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party and the member of the House of Representatives, we will teach everything from the contribution and subsidies for the profitable fiscal year to the techniques for tax reduction.
(Diamond Editorial Department: Yutaka Miura)
From heirs in the countryside to company employees in the city, inheritance taxes that were once "off-limits" will now be integrated into a more unified system of inheritance and gift taxes, and a comprehensive examination will be conducted in order to promote the establishment of a neutral tax system during the period of wealth transfer.
Instead of the tax reform outline published by the party last year, a major shift has taken place in which not only owners of capital but also the middle class have been affected.
This is because that thing to do, which is to change the rules of inheritance and deprive the "pre-death donation" of the way to become the king of the inheritance tax, means that the inheritance tax will be greatly increased.
The ironclad rule of the progressive tax system is to "reduce the tax base."
Its strongest cutting edge is that the tax is applied not only to homeowners in the three metropolitan areas but also to company employees who live in their own homes.
Such is the case with the integration of "ancillary taxes and fees".
In the 22nd Amendment to the Tax Act published on December 10, 2012, which had been postponed because of concerns, "Looking at the current system of inheritance tax and gift tax" "The non-tax measures of inheritance tax are a system that does not seek any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within a limited scope" etc. The direction of integration has been clearly stated.
It was said by the former head of the tax system and the former chief cabinet secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party.
It is a big issue to maintain the same tax burden during the period of capital transfer.
Now, (with integration), what kind of questions will come up? And, by the way, the chance to win the remaining three rounds is gone.
Regardless, in the near future, it would be a mistake to move in the direction of invalidating lifetime gifts as a tax strategy.
So, how do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change specifically?

【NFL】1試合パス3回で勝ったチーム選手たちは、なにをどのように感じていたのか（BBM Sports ） - Yahoo!ニュース
This attempt was one of just three passes thrown by Jones.
It was just the third time in the past 50 years of the NFL that a player had rushed for 200 or more yards in a game since Bill did it against New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
In 1974, there was an outstanding genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who exceeded 2000 yards for the first time in the history of the season.
Biles joined Simpson and fellow R&B artist Usher in bringing down the house.
The biggest reason Patterson took the ultimate offence was the climate.
Buffalo is a town located near the border with Canada that is not significantly different from the Hokkaido Expressway.
And on that day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, and the wind speed was 18m. The wind was blowing strongly, and there was snow falling before the practice.
Biles went with a more difficult routine but did not change her selection.
With respect to Pass 30, Ran is 25.
Arlen's path is 15/30, 145 yards.
Intercept was impossible, and it was decided that it could not be done.
The Red Sox leads the series 4-0.
Especially in the third quarter, they continued to lead until the end.
However, they did not score a single goal in the three matches.
Trying to score the final goal before the final whistle.
The building that pursued the 4 points became 3rd&9 and then became 3rd&14.
18 years old until the goal.
On third-and-14, QB Alex was trapped in the Peyton defense and flowed to the right from the pocket.
And Tedson of Endon tried to pass but failed.
In this play, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith took a shot at Golden State's Klay Thompson, saying he couldn't get a shot off against the All-NBA forward.
On fourth-and-18, Allen fired a pass at wide receiver Gabriel Davis but it was tipped in the air by Patriots defensive back Miles Branch and fell incomplete.
Brian had covered Bills WR Kelvin Benjamin with Manziel, but when he saw Allen's movement, he released Benjamin and retreated.
Alen, who watched the replay of the two receivers, threw the ball twice and aimed for the end zone.
Whether the 4th down pass was caught or not, the third down did not require an attempt at a touchdown.
It's good to win the first down on second play.
He still had 2 minutes left, so he had to use his ability to survive until the end.
And growing a beard.

Sponges
However frequently they are replaced, they are not replaced as frequently as they are recommended to be.
According to a study in 2017, kitchen sponges are also found to have a lot of bacterial reproduction every day, even when killed by electronic appliances such as microwaves (so killing them with appliances is good too).
The German researcher who conducted the study recommends that sponges be replaced once a week to maintain cleanliness.
Mana board
The US Department of Agriculture pointed out that once the paint is scratched or chipped, it should be replaced.
Once bacteria start to grow, it becomes difficult to keep them clean.
Even in the best-case scenario, you should never forget to frequently disinfect the solution of undiluted liquid bleach (around 3.8 liters or 1 gallon) in table spoon 1 cup of water.

Even so, it's become a "hero's redemption" by sniffing out the foul smell of the money-grubbing Wana and avoiding it.
Even so, "so all of a sudden, you can avoid it completely. So you don't have to become suddenly strong in physical ability!" was what Kuroda said to Aoyama.
Even if an ordinary person suddenly becomes incredibly strong, they can only use the power and technique they have accumulated so far as potential.
Rewards are given to those who work hard. Efforts that bear fruit are rewarded, and those that do not are not. The "equivalent exchange of effort" that rewards people for their hard work is a fundamental human song, and it is a difficult rule to follow in this work.

Samsung Electronics launches new "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile phones, emphasizing user experience (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Samsung Electronics, which integrated the CE and IM departments, decided to name the department DX (Device eXperience) and reflect this in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year, the company announced on the 12th day of the month.
A variety of services ranging from mobile phones to home appliances are aimed at enhancing the user experience.
Samsung Electronics, which integrated its CE and IM departments to newly establish the DX department, was revealed to include VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and other business units.
A spokesperson for Samsung Electronics said that "the name change this time reflects the long-term business structure and future orientation, as well as the strengthening of global readership."
In addition, products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment are also being emphasized as services and solutions that reflect the needs of customers and enable consumers to easily and enjoyably optimize their experience.
A strategy that aims to build a foundation for the launch of a unified reader system that exceeds the boundaries between organizations and achieves economies of scale through the creation and differentiation of products and services is also named.
Already, Samsung Electronics has been working on a strategy to allow users to freely use content and services by connecting devices such as home appliances and smartphones that are based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) through the Multidevice Experience (MDE) alliance.
Is it true that 1500 BCE is the same as before the era?
What would you say in Japanese?
It was 1500 years ago.
BC stands for "Before Christ," but is it appropriate to use this notation for people outside of Christianity? As a result, in recent years, the notation BCE (Before the Common Era) has been used instead.
BCE stands for Before Common Era (before Western era).

Aichi 24 hours collision: Train driver was not ill and did not pay attention (Television Asahi Corporation (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In a traffic accident in which 24 vehicles collided in Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture, the driver of the vehicle that was arrested and taken for questioning is suspected to have caused the accident due to some sort of negligence.
In the morning of the 10th day of the month, 24 vehicles including trucks and buses on National Highway 41 in Xiaomu市 collided and 12 people were slightly injured.
Suspecting that the accident was caused by the 71-year-old man, the police arrested Yamanaka Shoya (54), who was operating the tractor, and sent him to the prosecutor's office on the morning of the 12th.
The trainer of the villagers suspected that the brakes were applied after the accident and that the firefighting and the accident occurred immediately after the loss of consciousness of the villagers.
However, according to the investigators, it was found that there was no illness among the villagers and that some negligence was the cause.
Police are searching for leads and are questioning people in the area.

Review of "One Piece" [Comic Volume 4] [Weekly News] - Yahoo! News
The 20th Olympic Games, which started from the third volume, is completed in this fourth volume!
Instead, it was a brand new shake-up.
"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Review Submitter Name: Oguzuma X ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) Superhuman Pro Wrestling has been going on since before the match!
This is the fourth volume of a work that describes the decisive battle between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask in detail. However, the first thing to note is that it is not just a summary of the ring matches.
Starting from the Indianapolis 500, we will compete against each other in the oval ring battle and in the training scene, etc. until then, we have not fought against each other at all. However, it does not mean that we will give up.
The sense of tension that the century's first battle is about to begin is increasing in the work in progress. The feeling that the tension of the readers is also accurately reflected, and the performance during this period is really calculated.
And the main event will be Terim's third fight against Rumenov.
While boasting a touch of luxury as a battle card, what I like best is the ramen man who, before the fight, directed his poster towards the "We'll win this one for sure!"
And try to choke him.
However, the terminator, who had been relentlessly pursuing Sarah, stopped in his tracks when he saw the knife in her hand, and the scene ended with him walking away without a word.
Whatever the case, both have already been defeated, so there is no need for them to fight in the conference.
There are also many delicious dishes using pork.
If we see such things, we cannot help but think about the distant future!
It's just one of those things where the characters stand, and as a manga artist, I'm still feeling the pain!
Such a fight would not be over so quickly, but the finish would come from the ramen man after the match.
You can't just leave it up to "the power of God"!
It is a selfie.
This is just a magnificent statement against the work itself. So far, readers have felt that Kin-chan and the protagonist cannot lose, and that they are not skilled.
However, by making this statement, Mr. Yamaguchi has become the first person in the ramen world to be able to use this technique.
In one fell swoop, the reader is left thinking, "Is that all Kinpachi can do?
How? 」
So, let's imagine once again a development that has never been seen before, and let's look at it as if it were the work of another author. In that case, it would be the same as if Mr. Yukio Mishima had committed hara-kiri in front of everyone.
This is an amazing thing.
I think that one of the big points of this page is that there is no mistake.

It happened.
1. Open the window to let in fresh air.
Calling on the phone at this time.
2.) A little while later, when I tried to return to the room, a pink rotator sound came from the PC.
I only thought that the movement of the fan was bad due to the low room temperature (6℃).
So I tried warming up the room again.
3. Start.
The moment the power button is pressed, the power lamp will stop immediately.
I won't say anything after that.
I tried unplugging the power plug again, but it only lasted for a moment.
4. Connect the motherboard and ATX20 pin, and try to start without removing any other parts.
It is suspected that the PSU is not the cause since a buzzing sound similar to "bubbubbubbub" has been heard by PSU fans since before.
I will try to find the ATX power supply later.
