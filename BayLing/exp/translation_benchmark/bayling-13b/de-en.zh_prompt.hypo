The levy equates to 40% of the value of goods...
I am #PRS_ORG#'s wholesale customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction to track my parcel so that it can be returned to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago for €249.
Today it costs €179.
I find that honestly very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for a better price or is there another way to get a refund?
I also fundamentally think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think that big brothers and sisters also benefit from being moderately concerned about the little ones.
Short glances, short help, bring the bottle etc.
So they learn responsibility, help out at home and are included.
As long as they are still able to have enough children themselves, I don't see a problem with that.
If your K1 wants to be alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You are best placed to decide what is right for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
In law it is probably doubtful.
This is why the psychologist's statement may also be true.
Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to look after K2.
Whether that is a risk you are willing to take is of course up to you.
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot but I just can't remember the title, maybe someone here knows something...
The story was about fear and dealing with it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and walking into his lions' enclosure.
The case is taken on by a female detective who, after a short investigation, uncovers that his therapist runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The commissioner has a small niece who is also afraid of fire and ends up with this therapist.
It will lead to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the location of each suicide and document it and then post the photos on the internet.
In fact, it turns out that this therapist was running some kind of underground therapy group where a chip was implanted in the patients' brains that suppressed their anxiety and the patients ultimately became extremely anxious.
(a woman jumps out of a window, another deliberately kills herself)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
There is a big showdown at the hospital that was on fire.
That is the rough plot I am quite sure the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If this action is known to someone or if someone could even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password.
I have to contact my husband first.
But this can take time.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the thumb nail.
Kind, four years old, has splinters under the nail (outside).
He tried to pull it out with a pair of pliers.
Very difficult to grasp.
That didn't work and it hurt.
Now, the child has a hysterical reaction when we try.
No chance at all.
Tomorrow I go to the doctor.

Due to Omega: Johnson wants to drive forward vaccine development
New omega-3 cases worry politicians and scientists in the UK.
As a result, all eligible adults in England should receive the vaccine by New Year.
London - The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, wants to move faster with the coronavirus booster jabs than has been the case to date, given the rapidly increasing omega figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided it has been at least three months since the second vaccine, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The deadline has been set for the end of January so far.
The UK Government will provide additional support to ensure vaccination campaigns are accelerated across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the omicron variant, we are in a state of emergency, and therefore the vaccine must be strengthened as a matter of urgency, Johnson said.
The good news is that a third dose may be able to restore protection.
Now, let's get this done," Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1,239 further cases of the omega strain were recorded in the UK, taking the total to 3,137.
In comparison to the previous day, this was an increase of a full 65 percent. dpa
is the full purchase price refunded if collected?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have submitted an application.
The invitation to a talk came by email today.
I want to respond to the email.
Alas, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat complicated name.
I have looked it up and depending on where he/she has a cultural background is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any bureaucrats' toes either.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books on it in total.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously the chair had an unapparent fault with it when it was sold.
How can such a mattress defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
Will try PRS_ORG first.
But that has been the case for about
No more than 14 days.
So I have been buying the last books through the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
There weren't any.
Now they are available again and I want to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for it.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content-Warning: I will be writing something detailed about domestic violence.
I need to write something from my soul.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really troubles me and unfortunately comes up all too frequently is that many victims do not seek help or think that we cannot help them.
I am aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my job that move me more than not being able to do something in situations like that.
I see the blue patches, the blood, the despairing eyes...
And even in a face-to-face conversation, with the perpetrator out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know why, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always try to make clear, and which is sometimes very close to tears, is that every life is worth living without violence.
I want women to know they don't have to simply accept the violence.
Often I wish I could help... I know I can't.
But it will never be easy.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
Arcane on Netflix: What does the series have in common with League of Legends?
Lots of fantasy, complicated names, an awe-inspiring production: "Arcane", the series set in the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second series?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg derby disaster at Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could count on.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Prior to the game, Ludwigsburg's coach, John Patrick, looking back to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We've still got a bit of anger in our bellies".
However, they didn't lie down after the game - instead, they raised their game in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
And it was more than just the bare result that was disappointing about the performance.
A statistic is quoted to sum up the entire dilemma: the treble quote stood at a mere 13 per cent, four goals (all by young Johannes Patrick) in say and write 31 attempts - any questions?
The response from John Patrick was: "We were simply not concentrated enough after winning at Tenerife and did not do what we had trained for".
Actually, to move the ball.
His opposite number, Sebastian Gleim, had a different reaction: "A great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday, just 750 visitors were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena, but they had to pay for the privilege.
This is also thanks to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and controlled the game for his team.
The best playmaker I have ever trained, Gleim praised.
Meanwhile, in Patrick's team, even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) let the side down.
The giants prevented a total disaster in the last quarter (10.15pm) when they came back to within eight points, after they had been 39-59 behind.
Alongside Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
There is happily not much time left for that.
On Wednesday (7 p.m.) the giants are already receiving Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
All claims for compensation were unfortunately rejected.
We have taken legal advice and have written to them again about it.
We signed up originally six months ago.
Still the same as when he was hatched: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthral his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is travelling with the programme "A lovely day" - if he is allowed to perform at all.
Max Raabe had actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has now been postponed until May 2022 - "at the request of the authorities" to help combat the Coronavirus.
Other appearances planned for Advent time must, for now, be called off, as it says on the website of the singer, who today turns 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
The artists then want to reschedule the dates they postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic from January.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and loved to sing as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He dragged it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always impeccably dressed, with his blond hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer unforgettable in the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been touring with the programme "Good day, dear luck" since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It is to be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check in advance whether it fits colour-wise
It still doesn't work. I can only see the cover page but not browse the pages.
Federal building minister Klara Geywitz: No new homes are created through expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a Berlin referendum.
With a compulsory purchase no new homes are created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will be affordable over the next few years.
A mixed portfolio of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies, is incidentally the best protection against a monopoly forming.
The coalition of SPD, the Greens and the Left party in Berlin is going to set up an expert committee to work out how to handle the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz will not rule out talks with the FDP in the ruling coalition about tightening up rent laws further.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and an extension of the rent mirror.
I will speak to the justice minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not improve, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and a couple of days ago it occurred to me that I had forgotten the final step of payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it ever come again?

The voucher sounds great.
Then I will sort it out with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamps are dispatched in March, how long does the dispatch itself take?
I have already cut myself
That is an absolute cheek
At Least 100 Dead From Tornadoes In Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be attributed to the storm.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
Several tornadoes tore through parts of the US overnight Friday, leaving a trail of destruction and potentially hundreds of fatalities.
The storms left a roughly 320-mile path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster zone that everywhere the tornado had ripped through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Pieces of industrial equipment, tops are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
It is alone expecting up to 100 dead in the state of Kentucky, with the official numbers rising constantly.
Hello, I just saw that vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
"That is very bad."
Is it still being made?
Or have they been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
When will you report this?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, I can order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, can't I?
I had replied to the contact form or abandoned it and wanted to inquire whether it arrived or is being processed, as I have not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay the vaccine premium and change their advertising slogans
While the government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money for being vaccinated.
This puts them on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives to be given for vaccinations.
The re-wording of advertising slogans to encourage people to get vaccinated - following the German example - is also intended to increase readiness to get vaccinated.
He moved to a company that he had criticized.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
He openly didn't stick to his old place and sought something else.
You can too.
And that he didn't like you back then: naja, whatever.
He did not like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the booking.
That will then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaigns
Hello!
I am currently preparing an adventure "Over the Grim Pass" for a group of 4 friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specifically written for players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arch is done, the baddies and their motives written, individual acts imagined, and now I'm coming to write the opening adventure and I'm stumbling over my own feet already.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to transport a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
The action should develop from there.
A mile or so from the village, the heroes are waylaid by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush.
I want to give player characters the possibility of resolving confrontations in several ways: through persuasion, action, threat, danger detection at an early stage, whatever seems most appropriate for the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres armed.
If not noticed, the goblins lurk in a hollow way and flank the hero, armed with bows, three to the left and three to the right, while two stop the cart with spears.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
The heroes are all knocked out, and are then found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
The trolley is of course gone.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf and two of his retainers will attack and assist the hero in battle.
The trolley is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The Goblin group later plays a crucial role, so it's not just cannon fodder.
"EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips."
I will definitely incorporate many of your ideas and I now also have more confidence in my storytelling.
I took the lamp apart again.
And they're at it again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
This is why I would still like to send it back
Can you then let me have the invoices so I can pack the lamps and bring them to #PRS_ORG#.

Here the lower part, i.e. the part with the loading space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the loading space?
I am fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on German Sky has got worse and worse, so I want to give this post a little air.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted today during the F2 race in order to begin the F1 build-up report on time.
Admittedly, due to the late start and the crash at the beginning, the schedule was far behind, but it would have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) nevertheless.
However, it seems that for legal reasons priority was given to F1 and therefore everything else had to give way, so that Sky DE had no choice.
Still daft though, especially as Sky UK had the race covered.
Even a small amount of praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules in F1 when commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher did not know that you are allowed to change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation had occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was not until there were relevant radio messages to Hamilton that the decision was taken to allow Verstappen to change tyres.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should just know these basic rules if you're commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first mystery that now, according to the rules, is possible or prescribed, both have simply constant uncertainties on the subject of the rules.
Generally Roos' artificial commentary style does not appeal to him, but he does admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even prefer Heiko Wasser of RTL.
This is coupled with constant buffoonery which both simply comes across as unprofessional, such as getting a coffee with (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular has caused a great deal of unrest in the comments, which he clearly does not take seriously.
Finally, advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the last few laps Sky is the only broadcaster going to advertising, as one can listen to on F1TV, only the German commentary after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels are also making less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster.
One has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone is not enough for me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1.
Ironically, RTL is doing a better job on the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes a lot less fun than it could be with a decent broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# - Pendelleuchte, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me she would check and send an email and never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already proved defective (it has a hole in the front part of the seat).
I'm asking for support.
Air pumps are ideal for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using a pump.
We offer this series in three versions.
Check out the table at the end of the offer.
You can compare the services there.
If the pumps are powerful enough, you can run the entire system with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect more water outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model of the fan, but for those who want to draw attention to their aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (which can be found in our shop), or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, mussel or the like should be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction, which means low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an extractor via an air hose 4/6 mm...and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should either be at the same level, or higher than the water level, and located outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, one should put a check valve in between.
Cut the air hose simply and place the valve in between.
This would prevent it, if water were to run backwards, that the water from the basin flows through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be placed outside, then, like other air pumps, it should be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Although we state a processing time of 3 days on eBay, we are packing every day and the parcels are being collected every day.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just wanted to avoid anyone being out of tune, just because it took a little longer.
That is how it is, not everyone has understanding for all the staff that also work in the forwarding business...of course the Corona virus does not stop here.
Please don't judge us too harshly just because delivery is delayed - that is solely down to the postal service.
Of course one mocks these services, even though we are saying at the moment... they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
how long does it take for the yellows to be delivered with and without armrests?
Can we also order the legs in a lighter shade?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were carried aloft by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Blue Origin, founded by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.
The roughly ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos warmly welcomed the freshly graduated astronauts on their return.
Welcome back," Bezos said, wearing a blue flight suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
The six passengers emerged one by one to the cheers of friends, family and co-workers from Blue Origin.
According to Blue Origin, they were airborne for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998) - after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named - and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were among the company's passengers, along with space engineering expert Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their tickets, Blue Origin did not say.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission her father undertook after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything for himself when he was out there.
The 74-year-old said she just went along with it, laughing.
Michael Strahan was also full of praise.
The presenter said he would love to go back into space immediately.
New Shepard flies to 100 kilometers in height
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, occasionally experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed by large parachutes and landed.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third human space flight: The first in July had Amazon founder Bezos on board with his brother, a former US pilot aged 82, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became a household name as "Captain Kirk" in Star Trek, as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin vice president Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of prioritizing the business of space tourism over scientific research and the well-being of humanity and the planet.
With a simple twist, you can choose whether your "smart stone" will permanently light up in one colour or whether it should show off its entire colour spectrum.
On a color change, the pigment remains lit for around a minute, before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light means that it can be left outdoors all year round.
In a snowy environment, its light even performs particularly well – you have to allow for condensed light duration as soon as the days get shorter.
In winter, please make sure that snow does not impair the solar module in its function.
Smart Stone uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (AA) format, which is easily interchangeable when necessary.
You can obtain a suitable replacement battery via our web shop, thus extending the period of use of your torch.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry.
I am currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and I find the subject matter quite interesting and I don't mind the lab work either (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical).
I had already informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would study until my doctorate for sure.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my future career.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears of fantastic job opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand, one always hears of unemployed biologists and appallingly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
What are they working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/What education have you received?
Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and doing a training course to become a professional IT specialist.
If you have experience in that, write about it too)
Stress before holidays & weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
However, I now had to use my long weekend to unwind.
That's why this is now a post about it.
There is a lot of stress in our company not only around major holidays such as Christmas.
As it seems, this is also the case on holiday plus bridge days.
Actually, it was like this: Last week was the feast of the Assumption, which with us in Switzerland is called "Auffahrt".
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridging day, which is semi-official.
So last weekend we had a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
According to emails that had to be sent before getting on the road, orders here, orders there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" after such a long time sounds wrong, doesn't it?
Or because people want to achieve in a shortened week as much as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also mightily irritated.
What is the purpose of this self-imposed holiday?
Why do we have holidays then, if we are not allowed to celebrate them properly?!
The stress did not come from on high, his colleagues were all perfectly capable of dealing with it.
My question is simply this: Are we the Swiss the only ones like this?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home town in Thuringia - but hasn't got any presents yet.
The beauty of it is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer on Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the celebration by baking little cakes and cookies with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
However, she still has some things to do before the contemplative days: "Firstly, I haven't got any presents yet - I really must get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the moulting and feather regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather disorders that occur in poultry farming are exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage is made of proteinaceous substance, a particularly rich and balanced diet containing protein is a prerequisite for the formation of a fault-free feather covering.
For proper metabolism, daily nutrition must contain sufficient amounts of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period are due to inadequate or excessive protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based foods is taken into account explicitly and balanced in the composition of NEKTON-Bio.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the application of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be given quite simply via the drinking water or via soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
This is the English translation of the sentence: "DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the loco was in service in Silesia and Central Germany, this very rare loco probably originates from the conversion proposal of the Model Railway Enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968, see photos, good function, The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy goods train electric loco of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), it was designed for traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small-scale firm ZSCHUT
A loco is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and we have restored it to working order
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a running speed of 45 km/h on this line.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
In this way, on 1st March 1926, DRG specified the supply of a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG Tatzlager drive and the supply of the mechanical parts to Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical parts.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01 to 06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves again in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The suitability for restoration of all six locomotives was established in the Imperial Railway Repair Works in Dessau.
With the increasing electrification of the central German network, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy goods services, and in 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were upgraded, with the other machines being used as donors for parts.
First preference was given to the large quantities of E 04, E 44 and E 94 that were available.
It was only when the E 94 could no longer be increased any further that the E 95 came into the spotlight for processing.
The locomotives were initially stationed in the Leipzig Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway works in 1960.
They were deployed in their own circulation plan, mainly hauling coal from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be a problem.
It was often the case that gunmen would stick to their actions.
The companion, who was always travelling in the cab of the engine, then had to use a hammer and crowbar to uncouple the gunner during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and led to months-long outages for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new-build locomotives were available and the expansion of the electrified network was not planned at that time, so that the Deutsche Bahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the branch lines, so that the E95 was taken out of service.
Their difficulty lay in the fact that the German Railways only wanted to employ electric locomotives with a single crew member, which, given the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the lines of sight from the driver's cab, presented a problem for train operations.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in the middle of 1969, E 95 01 was the last one to retire on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
All the locomotives were scrapped, except E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up in the main station in Halle as a welded rail heating system to replace the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
Some time passed before those responsible at the railway company could be convinced that E95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external renovation of the steam engine began with the goal of presenting it as an exhibit at the RAW Dessau vehicle show.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The internal completion of the locomotive was in 1986.
The locomotive is looked after in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community of Halle P have been working on the operational readiness of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the loco could be presented to an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt for the first time with a new internal and external livery, with the transformers having been checked and five motors being operational.
The locomotives were in service on the Schlesischen Gebirgsbahn and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945 the machines were moved to Leipzig, to be incorporated into the Central German network.
Its main area of operation was initially Silesia
"Handarbeitsmodel H0 in OVP, Funktion gut, es sind optische Nacharbeiten an der Lok in Eigenarbeit notwendig, eingestaubt, mit Spielspuren, Kellergeruch !!!, sehr seltenes Handarbeitsmodell, sehr kleine Auflage- womöglich stammt der Bausatz auch von der Kleinserienfirma ZSCHUTSCHKE und BACHMANN"
The packaging may show labels and storage marks.
If it's the F-parts
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is supported by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately poorly made.
The central beam does not fit into the planned support.
I also get sent new ones.
When will they be sent?
no not flat.
According to the assembly instructions those are the right ones, they were just too narrow
But that is irrelevant.
The main this is that they fulfil their purpose
They are not shallow with me
Could I receive a copy of this?
Hello #NAME#, would you like me to explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and significant damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated €600,000 worth of damage was caused, according to police on Sunday.
The fire seems to have spread from a carport into the adjacent house in Kinsau (in the district of Landsberg am Lech).
According to that information, two residents were taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The precise cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not consider the fire to have been deliberately set.
The Criminal Investigation Department at Fürstenfeldbruck has taken on the further investigation.
But that comes much later
And I've got to pay postage again
To combat fake news - biotech CEO releases vaccine photo
Ugur Sahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccine status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
It was the illness of a friend that led Şahin to this decision.
The CEO and co-founder of German company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There were false reports on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have been given 3 doses of the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine, Sahin wrote on Friday in a post on the networking site LinkedIn.
For months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting a vaccine to counter the false rumors.
Up to now he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply upset to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
His schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated," Şahin continued.
He did not ask for reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be anxiety, stoked by misinformation and mistrust.
Anxiety is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with German World is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says that he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
At the moment it is not legal for me to have the vaccine myself, Şahin said back then.
Vaccination in Germany is being prioritised.
Meanwhile, the priority has long been lifted – and according to his own statements, the head of the biotech company has had himself injected three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire causing severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia were without power for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several municipalities as a result of the fire.
Power supplier Westnet reported that numerous emergency power systems were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late at night.
Fire-brigade people and THW helpers and helpers provided support in the communities.
Authorities were offering places in schools and appealing for help from neighbours.
The caterer thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very conscious that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire services and the German Technical Relief organisation for their unstinting efforts," the head of the primary technology division, Florian Witt, said in an announcement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet engineers were initially only able to restore some of the cables provisionally, he explained.
A technical fault led to the fire, according to company information.
The stream flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15pm heavily damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary there.
A connection to a 30,000-volt level has been developed parallel to this.
With the help of this bypass, power supply will be restored.
Electricity has been restored to over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth since 6pm on Saturday.
An additional 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually reconnected from 9.30 p.m.
Electricity was restored at 11.15 p.m. to those last affected by the outage.
Over 80 Westnetz and partner company fitters were deployed.
The authorities called for help from neighbours on Saturday afternoon, after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings.
It is important now that citizens look after elderly or lonely people in their neighbourhoods and let their local fire station know if they need help, explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) following a crisis meeting.
In setting up and operating emergency power systems, the main focus was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to official sources, temporary care places in schools have been set up for those people who are unable to care for themselves or who require electricity-dependent medical devices or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the roof in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is the daily cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the shelf on the tabletop.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this.
We wanted tables with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We now have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG came to me, but I can't cram it and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to receive a response.
"That is really easy!"
Well, in that case, let's do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I tried that before the chat.
Before the purchase I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low discount almost rude.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give way once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had taken a large lead after the ski jumping.
Please return the order number #NUMBER#.
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we have both done this and are using version 4.5...
it could be that they have already heard about the problem several times
I have directly contacted my #PRS_ORG#, a book has been bought, it seems to be there too.
When I try to open it comes the message, oh dear!
This document cannot be opened.
File may be defective, they report to customer services.
As far as I can tell it is a PRS_ORG epub file.
Can they help me further?
The chat connection is down and now?
I have to work in between as well!
So that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you put the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to do 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the invisible inside of the component or on a yoghurt pot.
First mark on the component
Draw the brush steadily, stroke by stroke.
A slight overlap of the colour layers later produces an even surface.
Avoid quickly going back and forth with the brush.
This leads to the creation of unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise appear later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can come to unsightly metal layers if they mix with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you use them.
The models achieve an authentic appearance through the decals or stickers.
From flags and aircraft markings to ship's names and automobile badges: the decals are the final touch for the model.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible.
A plane cockpit can be/easily glued in place before being fitted into the body.
More important than the right tools, such as scissors, pliers and a toothpick, is the amount of glue, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut each required decal out individually and lay them down for you.
Decals are also known as water slide images because you briefly moisten the reverse with water until the carrier paper goes dark through the moisture.
Then you slide the paper a little bit to the left and put the piece onto the corresponding place on the model (which you have also dampened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways.
Attention: Always check first whether the picture is properly aligned before removing it completely from the paper, so that it doesn't stick to your fingers, knit or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly if I look away, then I can no longer read it and have to log out and log in and download the book again and find my place.
I communicated with you on Saturday AM.
Can I get it via email?
For all 3 packages?
For the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me
ok trotzdem vielen Dank!
I will buy it somewhere else if the money is returned.
Will I get it back without any problems though?
In vitro fertilisation treatment with private health insurance/ What is a "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We spent some time in infertility treatment, now when it comes to billing with the health insurance company, they are suddenly balking.
In sequence:
We applied in advance to the children's wish-tracking service with the health insurance company and were given approval for three attempts.
The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth, and was covered by health insurance.
Some time later we tried for a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they were not covered by the statutory health insurance.
We again applied for cost coverage with the health insurance company and were again granted another three attempts.
After some further attempts (we carried out more experiments than promised, of course the most expensive ones with the health insurance company) we submitted the invoices to the health insurance company and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 treatments (2+3) the health insurance company only wants to pay for 3 treatments.
The justification: The first two attempts at fertilization are lost with pregnancy/birth.
The second wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The period of insurance cover begins with treatment and ends when treatment is no longer required."
The questions to the experts in this round go to:
Who is right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are covered) or us (we have to pay 5 attempts)?
Would the health insurance company have had to notify us that with the birth the subsequent attempts would be cancelled?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could share their opinions.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three versions by email and let me know how to best retrieve them?
In order.
We will not order anything more from them.
When they add my sales and my friend #NAME# (same address) they obviously lost a good customer.
They are welcome to pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund has been processed and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely disorientated when it arrives with me
Please see the screenshot of what my colleague wrote
It is clear and evident that the refund was triggered and I still have not received the refund via #PRS_ORG#.
They can inform their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the fault only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to arrange for a different type of packaging.
I will be able to take the cupboard down and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional hooks to purchase, but unfortunately we cannot find them on your website.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film is, precisely, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
According to Wikipedia,
低预算电影或低预算电影是一部由主要电影公司或私人投资者几乎没有资金支持拍摄的电影。
On the web you can find loads of lists of low budget films, for example on letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What annoys you about it?
And what maybe doesn't suit you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, and have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa, Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended once again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll soon give up because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
Half victory against Belarus comes at high cost for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high, and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus" borders with Poland and Lithuania," Bossong told the Protestant Press Service (epd).
The EU has not sustainably solved the confrontation, declared the researcher from the Berlin Science and Policy Foundation (SWP).
This state of affairs - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels itself as the winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong judged that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
If the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this will come at the expense of basic rights.
This is weakening the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
It seems it cannot be implemented if a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which is refusing to allow access to its borders even to the EU's border protection agency, Frontex.
Furthermore, according to Bossong, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus: an agreement on the basic principles of asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to information from Poland's border protection, migrants have once more attempted to get to Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were detained overnight Saturday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by the migrants near the place of Czeremsza.
According to that information, a soldier suffered a facial injury and had to be treated by a military doctor.
The border protection agency registered 52 attempts to cross the border within 24 hours.
On Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler of Minsk, of keeping them locked in with the prospect of EU entry.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have cordoned off border sections.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners are travelling to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU's response has been the pressure put on airlines, said Bossong.
There the EU has thrown its weight into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate a tough bandage and extraterritorial sanctions regime.
Minsk must also take internal political costs into account.
The Belarusian society is unlikely to be prepared for the security service regularly shifting thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One finale
Max Verstappen was judged by Mercedes to have committed two rule breaches during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes have appealed after the controversial Formula One finale in Abu Dhabi.
The silver arrows are suspected of breaking two rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to a perceived infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car period, when he was deemed to have illegally overtaken.
A second objection was raised against the decision at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes on the last lap to win his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre came shortly after the end of a safety car period in which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I check that.
I am speaking with the bank and will register again with you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fantasy day
Europe Park, the namesake of the Europa Park stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park reported, members and season-ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were able to visit the Europa-Park on this day free of charge.
There were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The rollercoasters glowed red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga side and the holiday park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, goes back to the early 90s.
The first Freiburg Fantag at Europa Park showed once again how well the partnership fits together.
It's great to see people having such a good time together on the rollercoaster," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is that €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "At Home" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note, and also served as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your botched chat and cheap junk from China.
Their mistake, which you rectify, not all from our budget.
Contact Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I/Mrs #NAME# will receive an email with a €60 voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to go to #PRS_ORG# today.

The super-flexible sound engine, without a fixed timetable, allows a model example simulation of all thinkable railway vehicles.
Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you the maximum control over your vehicle.
Sorry but just because he says he is not antisemitic, that does not mean anything.
That is how it is when a thief says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some kind of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should do so completely.
Yeah wow then you're just as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is just completely lost.
As far as I am concerned, a God started the whole thing off.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be held as close to the eye as possible.
The specially plan-achromatised lens system allows you to use the microscope practically error and colour-free, right up to the edge of the field of view.
Frequently, magnifying glasses are marked with a magnification scale.
However, these details only apply to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to get the best out of your Lupe, please take note of the hints in the table "Technical Data" (see the instructions in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even in impact scopes.
By applying an anti-glare coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When used under ideal conditions - the lens right up against the eye - reflections on the lens surface are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the attached user manual (German and English available).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women are searching for Christmas trees in the Krembz district
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
In one case, a man even drove his partner home again because they couldn't reach an agreement.
He plants around 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has experienced so many strange situations.
That makes the pre-Christmas time always fun, he says.
And with the coupon?
Otherwise I am a customer?!
I did receive a defective delivery, and now I have paid the full price for it.
In that case I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to argue here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their name because of this.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as nice.
Issues with glass fiber + Devolo DLAN/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in our house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am having trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLAN, which, with the exception of a few faults, sent and received data at 50 Mbit.
The new fibre optic connection delivers 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and via the LAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these come too.
However, on the other DLan module, which emits the WiFi, it no longer sends the full 500, but the fewer I am in the house with the module, the less comes (so use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3 etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that with the new fibre optic connection, the Internet in the first floor is now slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DSL, but there were similar large losses here too.
Can someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the fibre optic cables via the power lines?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really struggling why I have created a special account here.
I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to change your current account
No one thought that, for the first time, there would be peace in their current account - they were wrong.
While many banks used the autumn to get their hands on all sorts of sneaky ways of confirming past fee increases from their customers, the waivers on negative interest rates are also continuing to shrink.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered to be relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now they have halved the basic grant and even quartered the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate section of Postbank – to €50,000 for current and investment accounts, and to €25,000 for day-to-day accounts.
However, according to a spokesperson, these lower fees now apply to the entire German banking system.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously reduced the limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the case with ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is particularly loved by cost-conscious customers, has reduced the minimum rate from €50,000 to €25,000.
Nevertheless: according to figures from internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a minimum deposit of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank in Berlin has also reached a limit of 25,000 euros: However, a legal dispute with consumer centres is still ongoing there, and in the first instance the Berlin district court ruled against this regulation.
Now the banks are discussing whether the institutions should set aside reserves - for the event that the higher instances also declare the negative interest rates to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers must be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army
It now officially tops Hollywood.
But her life is a journey of peaks and troughs.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, the success of 2021's Friends reunion and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, is down to a lot of discipline and hard work.
An army of assistants, stylists and trainers are all busy looking after her appearance.
Still, Aniston said she only has one a day (yes, that's one chip out of a bag).
The fact that it has the same effect on female and male fans alike is really something.
Perhaps because she is simply unlucky in love - and still seeking that big love.
And has removed the wish for a baby from the list.
She was asked again and again when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who ask don't know me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will make one happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen's exit from Formula One has been more quiet than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That's it.
Räikkönen was forced to retire from the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi after just over half a race distance following a mistake and light contact with a band.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, and the "Iceman" has ended his career in the top echelon of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates for the departure.
Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich holt 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The target for the bob-sleigh pilot is the record of 94 victories set by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen.
I have worked it out, I would have to win neuneinhalb races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday he fended off an attack from Johannes Lochner by a clear half a second, taking him from third to first.
He then changed his approach to the material and on Sunday he led by 0.30 seconds.
He and his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) beat the Brit, Brad Hall.
Third was Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded for it, said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in a row.
Berchtesgaden's Johannes Lochner, travelling for Stuttgart, went from second place to fifth this time.
After finishing in fourth place in the first race, Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came in eighth.
If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same, Lochner said.
Nolte clinches home win - podium for Jamanka
For the women, Laura Nolte on her home track took her third win of the season in the bob-sleigh.
After finishing only in fourth place the day before in the monobob, they raced to a world cup victory on Sunday, with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she also achieved her first podium finish of the winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get the first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me along.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential there, but today's start times were okay," said Burghardt, stressing that "it's not just about pushing, but there is a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little irritated by the less than perfect runs, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I have not received it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I have finally inquired.
Last year I had different problems because of Corona and never had time for that.
And now he is said to have upped and left which has made me very cross.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again because it's currently reduced!
Why was shipping not started until 16th March?
It does not say anything about such long delivery times on your website.
No, only when I click on it does an extra field with the message appear
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is that a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrong item.
However we still want the tray module, just a new undamaged one
And not cancel the whole order.
Only today, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and women,
I have something I want to write and perhaps it will go to one - or the other also so...
I'm 24, have a part-time job and am a mum to a dog - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to nursery, he is basically my one and only child.
My friend (together since 6th grade) is sick, suffered a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs too, and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burns).
He is also cold and we currently see each other less (1-2 times a week), which is making it very difficult for me to deal with my needs for affection and love.
My dog is currently suffering from stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying on his cushion and has relaxed a bit after I put on the warm lamp and petted him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she has just gone away for a month.
Now we've also got homework to do as well, which we of course split between us.
However, even boiling water is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS illness is going very well, I am halfway through treatment and getting there.
Not good, but I manage and am almost symptom free.
My university demands a lot from me right now, I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm that I haven't prepared for yet, and I have an anatomy class tomorrow that I should at least prepare a bit for.
And next Tuesday I have an oral exam, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left.
This is my week so far: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then everything just carries on regardless?
Just until the birthday.
Only until the holidays begin.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on for ever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental markers because otherwise I'd crack.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Is it the same for you?
Ehrlich, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly grateful, I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think that has a lot to do with women's mental load and that's why I thought I'd find kindred spirits here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color and the surface is scratched and the table leg has a mark on it.
The first delivery the colour was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change tables now will I get another color or what?
The email regarding the cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Anyway, twice.
This was confirmed, however.
Mal was completely different: When I was at school I realised that many RE teachers didn't believe in God and it was just another subject to them like Maths or Geography.
For me that was always something strange, perhaps because I was brought up Christian and I have always believed in some way.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you could also talk to colleagues at work or study with about different attitudes.
Fundamentally I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to keep them separate.
There is also a syllabus etc.
But it would be simply strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to learn about religion if they don't believe in it?
Upholding culture or something?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English, I understand that too.
That is a very long time, then I would give up
It is good, thank you.
I expect a response immediately, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please.
Hello dear people.
I am looking for a film from my childhood (24).
I think it was a film for youngsters.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
The past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
In the real world there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead a young soldier (in a uniform similar to that of the soldiers from The Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason their paths cross and something happens.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to take the woman to this kingdom in order to survive, I think.
The transition is also, I believe, the soldier's grave.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this tells you something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on her tummy from week 1.
Fast forward: lives on :D
Relax.
So a child holds out much longer than one thinks.
Make sure that everything is in order, no soft toys, go in and have a look every now and again, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No cushions.
Achso and ours never had a sleeping bag, always a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Turns his head to the side?
Can something be done from the gut?
Or is it with the face in front, directly on the mattress?
This allows you to see if everything is alright.
We are all grown up now and when my husband came into the world it was a case of zig-zagging around and laying the kids on their tummies to get them to sleep.
Also, we are already "main customers" with you and have already bought many articles
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not yet received a response.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently out of action.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised much.
And yes I know myself that not everything can be kept.
And I have also enjoyed RBTV a lot.
It is just that the politics of this broadcaster are now so watered down.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then immediately go on a big begging tour.
They say they are an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a litre column."
What are we now?
An 0815 advertiser trying to flog his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
Except for Simon and Etienne, of course.
Of course people will continue to be offended.
A Krogmann, who is completely lacking in empathy, is trying to make a profit from the campaign by sub-letting the exploded rooms.
How should one find all of this good?
Toll if you like, I find it terrifying.
I am writing to request a recall as my delivered wooden table is defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply to cuddle – my little warm friend has many uses.
Kirschkern-Kissen are a traditional home remedy for pleasantly warm applications, as Kirschkerne absorb heat very well and can release it again in a measured dose.
The detachable inner cushion is very easy to warm up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft towel makes it particularly pleasant to use, so that even if they are not doing so well, the little ones feel safe.
The Kirschkern cushion with a cover is suitable as a heat pad only for the following applications:
Before warming up kissens on an unusual smell, check for stock or burn marks and remove immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave using a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (pay attention to the microwave manufacturer's instructions!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the warmth evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On initial heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated use.
Adhere to the recommended preheating instructions as extended periods or high energy usage can cause damage (火灾和燃烧危险!).
Before microwaving the kissens, check the manufacturer's instructions for permission to heat grains.
Once the warmed inner lining has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the Kissen on your wrist (max 43°C) suitable for babies!
Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh haematomas, haemorrhages and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain perception.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor conditions, or are pregnant, please consult with a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose fillings have come out, dispose of the product and the loose fillings immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the child's temperature should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second in series - Pauli wins in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation zone.
It is not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover over interim trainer Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after their unsuccessful start under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged through its charger.
I bought this about 5 months ago so it should still work.
I thought a power supply alone would be enough to run it.
False alarm. The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the charger being plugged in.
I then took out the battery, but that didn't work either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is on order, but why can't I use the laptop while it's connected?
Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I want to receive the delivery of #PRS_ORG# in my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the PRS_ORG chair.
But we don't know how high the seat is...
Are you often on tour and yet have a lot of equipment with you?
The Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design is the solution!
Its 20 litre capacity will also swallow larger camera set-ups without any problems, and these can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And if you need any other everyday items, thanks to the practical accessories in the individually configurable interior, they remain well-organised and separate from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the range is also presented in a new look.
Its sleek, minimalist design is proverbial - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the interior of the backpack reliably, and at the same time, allow seconds access to photo equipment.
This works in two ways: conventionally through the hinged flap which can be locked using the MagLatch locking system, a superbly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already been tried and tested at the Messenger Bags.
Inside the flap is a metal clasp with matching anchor bars on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of several "stuff sacks": there are actually 4 aluminium bars, securely riveted, into which the closure fittings can be hammered.
If the rucksack is full, you simply take the top board, if it is rather empty, you take a deeper one.
The catch and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the rucksack can be reliably closed without having to insert the hook.
The second possibility differentiates the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other camera backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the main disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail hugely increases the practicality of the rucksack: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel gear.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior space individually (more on that below) and so store both items problem-free and separate from each other – and access both through the two side openings regardless.
So, you can also pull the rucksack towards you from the right side so that you can access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, for example, while everyday items stay safe in the left rucksack half and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with this.
And because the rucksack's outer cover is made from 100 per cent recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for an email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the appointment.
The delivery company has announced that they will be in contact regarding the collection of the wrongly delivered table.
I haven't heard anything yet.
I request an immediate resolution.
I am now writing to the third support employee, with none of whom I have got any further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#.
When can you expect delivery of the wardrobe?
To keep him at this level is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.
Have a nice evening
"Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?"
The order and payment were on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp to the one I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order immediately, but nevertheless I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And I couldn't imagine that last year would turn out differently from how it was planned, and I simply couldn't find the time to implement and clarify it.
As a customer, I accept that.

The additional openings improve the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the slots improving the cleaning of the brake discs and pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted glass underline the attractive and striking appearance of every car.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing masses in the water near the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and set off the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands arrived from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Sections were marked out, tents were pitched and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted a share in the country's wealth.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the west and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding riverbanks and adjoining areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have had the same idea!
You have to outperform your peers to avoid going bust like them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to be more efficient, gain extra actions or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune your individual playing style.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the board where they can carry out actions.
Then they reveal their selection and place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions that can be taken there.
Players then take turns carrying out actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on until the caller moves five times, thus once covering each location and the year ends.
There is a shoot-out in which players must defend Coloma from an attack by marauding bandits.
If players have contributed enough revolver heroes, and have thought carefully about the bandits, they will receive rewards.
But when they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting range, then there is the final ranking.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why children are not tyrants: Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today and I watched it immediately.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he touched off a heated debate about education.
Former patients and those with parental responsibility are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be aware, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults must never, never, never give up our power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, it still gives me the shivers.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the scrapping of the obligation to take the test for those who have had three doses
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting about a nationwide abolition of the testing obligation for trivalent vaccines.
The countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when three times vaccinated individuals are no longer required to take the test, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the conference of health ministers, speaking to "Bild am Sonntag".
The dropping of the third dose of the vaccine was "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional booster," said Holetschek.
German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has pledged that "he will make a proposal to the health ministers' conference already next Tuesday".
Also, I want to send the lamp back.
How should I approach this?
Hello, I think the PRS_ORG chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can they help me further?
I can no longer purchase anything through my #PRS_ORG.

I have updated my account information.
What could be the reason for this?
What you are describing is referred to as *awareness* under full anesthesia.
They occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common are sounds/voices, less frequently are images seen and even more rarely are pains perceived.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that go hand in hand with a high level of awareness, since in order to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut, a very deep anaesthetic is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia techniques such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
"My dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but by definition, u/Nitemarex had none."
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
The 20 euros are not helping us unfortunately.
Those are statutory entitlements.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take the defective chair away.
This is not only a legal obligation, but also a standard in the field of e-commerce.
Please check again if they at least take the broken chair back.
We then sell the second seat privately.
We will also lose some money.
I already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
Once again, the question.
The order and the invoice specify that the goods are to be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They informed me that they will only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I will have to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
am I not called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental history of the theatre.
Günther Rühle died on Friday, at the age of 97.
There, lying on the table, is the new book, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
An unsettling diary of a slow withdrawal from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle up to April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The final sentence in the book reads: "I hereby give thanks for my life".
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are Europallets, standard wooden pallets, which are used above all in the European region as a means of transport.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association, EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over 10 million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many palettes are imported annually into Austria will not be charged
New York clinches first MLS championship
New York City FC has won the title for the first time in Major League Soccer.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final 4-2 in a penalty shootout.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had gotten the better of Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
"Rouladen Tips & Tricks"
I got loads of great tips here a week ago for the perfect stew.
There was one at Christmas which was incredibly delicious and creamy!
Thank you again for that.
Now I am hooked and want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I will put a beef fund on it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens now?
What about the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I am getting there
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by email on 18th January that the refund had been processed.
But to this day the money has not appeared in my account.
Please check that.
Where in the Lübeck region there is still Christmas roast
For many people, goose or duck is a tradition at Christmas, just like the Christmas tree and presents.
You haven't got any chickens yet?
Now time is short.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" setting of a tube amplifier stage plays a crucial role in determining the heat and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by Valve Reactor Control.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls you can set both the desired level and the stereo balance of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers feature a unique POWER LEVEL control which allows you to reduce the gain without changing anything on the "Gain" control or the distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL regulator even allows you to call up a performance reserve if it gets too noisy.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulators, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilised in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation so that even when using headphones or making direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
An aux-in jack can be used to connect a CD or MP3 player so you can listen to your favorite tunes.
A tuning function is also on board – so you don't need a separate tuning device.
If you additionally invest in a VFS5 foot controller, you can call up the sounds comfortably using your foot, activate the effect blocks and adjust the tempo of the compatible effects "tapping".
This is essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But others saw it differently.
Will you then have the possibility to send the lamp back?
Because they are too low over a table to eat?
So I would send them back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the wardrobe?
Can we expect another update on the precise delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hallo, have they sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs yet
If it doesn't work out, I'd be happy with a refund or voucher.
Depending on the circumstances, I can find a buyer for the furniture.
But €1,000 for goods that I don't need is still a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know whether screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hooks.
'This is not a satisfactory response and the wait has not been worth it.'

Iran says progress made in nuclear deal talks
According to Iranian information, progress is being made in the negotiations about the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that are supposed to be on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.
He described this as a "positive and important development", because initially there had not even been agreement on what should be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed after a brief interruption of one week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
Another US delegation is in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - state now has highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
This is the only federal state where the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia is the only federal state where the corona incidence on Sunday lay above 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute put the seven-day infection rate at 1,025 new cases per 100,000 residents.
In Saxony, which has recently always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this figure stood at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but still lay above 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new cases of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within a day.
On Sunday, 200 severe Covid-19 cases were treated in hospital intensive care units.
Registration delays can occur at weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been swamped for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
As delivery won't take place until March, that may be possible.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and take it to the post office, right?
Do I need to click/input/fill in anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return shipping costs, please.
8 euros return fee is a cheek in my eyes.
It's time for change.
"The German Bundestag greets me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!"
Why is this post here?
If one looks at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, one can see that it does not exist.
We've fallen into a winter rut and extended the summer drought for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it?
Most of that is down to simple dissatisfaction with how things have been going for us recently and how we are generally performing.
Over the last few days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here are really enthusiastic about the German Bundestag.
What we must change
At this point, the community around the German Bundestag is asking which of these it wants to keep alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who turned up to this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some discussion, a number of people from the community were found who were willing to rebuild the project.
However, I once again call upon everyone to participate, so that this project can also have a future.
We have established a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange ideas with one another and work on concrete things.
You can access the server via this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag work in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves abroad in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we achieve a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure I missed something, but it's not a big deal, we can discuss it at the end on Discord.
If you are interested and have the time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade for you which will be delivered soon.
Now I see that the article is too bulky and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another mount for you.
I put it together and realised it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: does the daily cover #PRS_ORG# also come in oversize, i.e. in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe is picked up promptly.
And I beg you to do so now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the shelf as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long do I have to sort these out or decide to send them back?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like very much.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently also rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a number of years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned stepping stone, I honestly answered without much thought.
And indeed, I used to think that as a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in doing so I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
In that moment I got the impression that discomfort had arisen on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat comes from and as a vegetarian she reduces animal suffering.
Now I ask myself whether my answer was "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan one quickly gets stuck in a corner and conflicts arise that one wouldn't want to have.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Their #PRS_ORG# does not release them from legal provisions governing remote selling.
I will not collect my return from #PRS_ORG# on the designated date.
As I cannot be there in person for a funeral, that cannot be changed, unfortunately.
Can you please assign me an alternative pickup time?
I will be available from 01.02.#NUMBER#.
Lahnsteiner flood protection equipped for water rescue: €45,000 grant from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate's Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant cheque for €45,000 to Lahnstein's mayor, Peter Labonte, for the town's volunteer fire service's new water rescue vehicle.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The device van is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
They carry out tasks above and below water in water rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is permanent increase in deployment: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the continued increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, by following their recommendations, I synced, removed and reloaded the app and NICHTS worked.
I am a little frustrated because it has taken a lot of time already and I am looking for help now.
Okay, then it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the aforementioned values were determined in the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C ± 3°C, 50%-80% relative humidity and with an installed 275mAh LiPo battery.
The values may vary depending on the type of torch used, age and environment.
The burn duration in the brightness stage contains the burn duration with reduced brightness due to overheat protection.

First of all, thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, so we were also bearers of arms in the executive, I won't go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simply put.
Fundamentally one should say, however, that the civil servant naturally comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should really be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people in uniform and carrying weapons should of course also be attracted to the conservative magic, and that these people then of course have difficulty with the lived reality, is of course also clear, because alongside the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggerated feminine queer cliché, because they are fewer in the executive, but rather normal men and women that one doesn't notice if they don't tell you), and on these people I must rely, because in doubt they will save your life or set it for you.
But even these fringe groups represent, in my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that they are being left behind by excessive left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly supports them or seems to be in their interests, they just want to be treated as normal people.
Going back to rights, of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, so one will find extreme right-wingers there, but that they should be allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly hatch any state-threatening plans is totally exaggerated by the media and annoys me.
Of course it happens that even police officers and soldiers, who were often on foreign missions, often start to stereotype and even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain like-minded individuals meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, something like that is well combated by my way of thinking and also counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so much intertwined with the international and in my opinion it is good that we cannot afford to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks!
ja, what I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
However, this was confirmed in your order confirmation
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# box for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany as well, or this box is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
However, on the edge of the wooden section, there are two deep grooves, filled with something yellow.
And there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Decent through child?
Hallo, mich (w32) beschäftigt eine Sache schon länger.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (independent, very little free time), but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything stays the same, and then sometimes it gets me and I clear up and clean.
But it is never really the case that "someone might just drop in for a visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly the household simply loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook there.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with children?
We haven't yet but we're working on it and this question has been occupying my mind for a while.
For me I have no motivation, I simply don't like it, as long as no-one is coming to visit and for example new clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Does having children give you a greater incentive or do you remain slapdash?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new and qualitatively high-end as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with a special, further molding at the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arm and knee bending)
With Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled in order to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the seams reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-shaped forms in the lower back area and when walking ensure a snug, perfect seat.
The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lower back area increases flexibility around the zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and putting on equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and lower back ensures increased flexibility when moving the arms and lower back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers high levels of cold protection.
Worn on the chest, it puts heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Nahtlose, thin (2 mm) sealing around the face on the bonnet improves comfort, sealing and durability (separate head bonnet).
The soft, collar-mounted zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width setting by means of a flexible, resilient press stud, which does not attach to the trimming or stitching.
Double cuffs with zips on the wrists and ankles connect a foldable inner lining with a soft, cushioned neoprene outer lining.
45° Stitching on the end of the internal cuff for increased elasticity and durability when pulling on.
Langer zipper at the nape with an elastication reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort in overall without a hood.
Langer G-Lock P quick-release buckle (without hat) with metal cam and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)

Neoprene reinforcements on all ends of the zip to prevent tearing, in case too much force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded with external and internal overlap
Raised edges on the outside cuffs provide greater durability.
Raised seams on the cuffs for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist computers)
A career in social work - as someone with low self-esteem?
I have a software development training and have been learning for about a year now.
However, I increasingly realize that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have an avoidant personality disorder (AVPD).
This roughly translates to mean that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level but I struggle with the small talk and have been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (whereas I believe I have got better at this).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
However, I do not know whether the concrete working day is really as I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it online.
The ÄVPS is already causing me problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something to criticize in my code ("again, just simple things messed up") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding up my dumb questions about the job"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in every job but I wanted to mention it here.
But have you got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a collection date.
What do they mean by "give back" please!
If I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message I get is "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book"
is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the food is broken down by the bird into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and from these it builds its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather development in the nestling and the formation of new feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it can interfere with the reproductive process.
In connection with this generous gift from NEKTON-Bio, we should return to a daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A powdered measuring spoon (enclosed) contains 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, double or treble the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially, until the approach to feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until feather regeneration is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry and out of direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
"That is really very bad service."
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement by a Parish Employee in Response to the Bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down in our garden.
A planning application has also been submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that pruning fruit trees and therefore walnut trees is not part of the statute.
The walnut tree is, however, listed as a protected tree in the by-laws.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on expert opinions.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
We will then use this new packaging for it.
I have not received a message.
Well, then I always have a sofa without using it.
Do you offer a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
"ja, das glaube ich, nur die Frage ist ja, ob ich in Euro bezahlen und mir die Decke nach Deutschland liefern lassen kann"
Can you check that?
Incident: Serious road accident in Selb
Recently, a serious road accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb North junction and Plößberg.
As the police press release currently reports (1:03 p.m.), a car came up on the wrong side when overtaking.
There are casualties.
Ah, okay, I understand.
Well, then many thanks again for it being so simple!
Advice and ideas for further career steps
Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas was moderately good because my dear head is just thinking of everything one can think of.
Before I go on a rant here, in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - you.
I am currently doing the ref as a lateral entry.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field related to that (so as to remain anonymous here, I won't be more specific).
However, it then became too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching and was sure that was it - even if the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other postings".
And it's only halfway through.
Before each fight I used to decide to carry on and at least end the round, then I could always turn things around.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
It's the holidays, but there's still a mountain of work waiting for me.
I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my evening my evening.
I was free there.
And the stress of the work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally wind me up.
Fundamentally it's good fun and from the outside looking in the reffing is going good, so the feedback and so on.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down - if it isn't already.
I wonder whether I want the rest of my working life to be like this - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I felt valued, could take time off when I needed it, found the work mildly boring but properly paid and enjoyed being part of a team rather than, as most of the time now, a lone fighter.
But then I ask myself, will I not be in the same place in a year, dissatisfied like now?
You realise it's all a bit muddled, but perhaps you, as an outsider, have advice or ideas as to how I can get myself out of this situation, where I start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not making decisions now, emotionally, that's likely to lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excusing the whiny tone from me.
I hope that my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has undergone continuous development, which has led, among other things, to the combination of cutting-edge modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a valve amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand-new modelling engine that is state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on an analysis of the parts and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have a level of authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly because it uses genuine analogue circuits, as these are better at capturing the sound variations and nuances of a valve amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers have a closed housing and a bass reflex system that has the natural resonances simply bubbling forth.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you always thought they should.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology first introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined to meet new sound demands, leading in 2010 to another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix range - with more dynamics and a host of improved amplifier models.
From the user-friendly VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that every guitarist in search of maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the final stage that determines the tube character of an amplifier, and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of any VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube forms the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a valve amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic fall to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from older brother Moritz, the Magic fell 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large flap is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro fasteners, it is tailored to your photographic equipment and is thus suitable for all types of cameras – from compact system cameras of all sizes to full-frame reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the rucksack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras, such as Sony's a7 range or the Fujifilm X-T2, still have room for more lenses.
You can also store all sorts of accessories in it.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the rucksack for your equipment and for photo-unrelated things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice for drone pilots, as it provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, lava flows on the Canary island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
The volcanic eruption on La Palma has now lasted for 85 days, making it the longest eruption in the known history of the Spanish island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted for 84 days, was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
Activity at the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has lessened over the past few days, but volcanologists did not venture a prediction of when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernandez Zapata, to state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, with damages estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land masses, each around 50 hectares in size, have arisen off the coast through cooled lava.
The banana plantations, which are hugely important for the island and on which around half of the approximately 85,000 residents live directly or indirectly, were particularly hard hit, and had been in crisis even before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas heavily damaged, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and the children are eagerly looking forward to the celestial festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are connected to the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, which makes it tempting in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still brings our increasingly divided society together.
It is more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss is a peace-promoting "contract of nature peoples", can break away from rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child
In a strict sense, it was the Protestants who closely connected Christmas with gift-giving.
On the previous day, St. Nicholas' Day, gifts were exchanged in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw three bags of gold through a window to three women one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving birthed a popular tradition in Germany of filling shoes, especially for children, with gifts.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject "Saint veneration" as a mediator between God and humanity.
For these reasons, they are wary of the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into Christkindl and thereby established a new tradition.
The focus of the celebrations shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer have such a close eye for detail, it only annoys a small number of people that the tradition of St. Nicholas, like the custom of St. Martin's singing and procession, is still such an integral part of the run-up to Christmas.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires – from socks to sought-after luxury watches – in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving on the feast day of St. Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian countries, there is great joy and excitement over the question of who will now bring the presents to the children.
In Germany, it varies from region to region as to whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is a kind of Santa Claus, to whom over time certain characteristics have been assigned.
This includes his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney, in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable creatures sometimes bring the presents, while in Russia, Father Frost achieved some glory.
Here it is not livestock, but three horses pulling the sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ child is responsible for handing out the presents.

Police shoot dead suspected bank robber near palace
A man armed with a knife was shot by police near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man walking around with a gun into a bank and a bookmaker's office.
The man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later, according to authorities.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Numerous embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Kate and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light fitting fits harmoniously into every garden, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored into the ground with two earth spikes.
Highly integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum duration: 10 hours.
The sturdy plastic construction can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, they are usually threatening objects from distant galaxies, which internally glow in colour.
In comparison, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: it is the sun that makes this solar-powered light fascinating – and in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic rounded shapes fit into every natural environment – whether on the edge of a terrace, in the grass or in a rockery.
He also thrives in the company of larger pebbles and boulders, where his size enables him to hold his own.
You can save yourself a lot of trouble: "Smart Stone" does not require an electrical connection or batteries - it is a solar light.
Place the 'milestone' on a popular, sunny spot during the day.
Two supplied earth spikes provide a secure fixing as required.
The matt-white plastic case itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar module conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly within it, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, «Smart Stone» begins to glow automatically; in what colour, you decide: a total of six attractive light colours are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
Shutdown also occurs automatically once the battery level falls below a predetermined minimum or light levels return.
Once the sun comes out, the charging cycle begins on the next day.
I have tried that several times, it did not work.
Shame, I would have liked to have ordered more from you, but if I can't use the voucher, I won't be ordering again out of principle.
If you change your mind then let me know.
Apart from that, this was my last contact with him today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
No DIY store has opened either...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has again been fundamentally improved.
A variable PWM frequency between 10kHz and 50kHz ensures particularly quiet operation for gearmotors – the characteristic "buzzing" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adjusted to accommodate up to 10 CVs, even for difficult cases.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the decoder to be automatically tuned to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder delivers up to 1.5A motor current to power even old motors.

Pillenproblem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post after a year of reddit.
My problem: I reluctantly started taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I was experiencing such horrific pain during my period and PMS leading up to it.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive outbreak of pimples during my last two-year break from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
So shallow, but it weighed on me and made me uncomfortable.
During the two-year pause, nothing was ever really normalised.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this happening.
I'm already perfume-free and noise-free, but maybe there's something you can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist didn't take me seriously and I've still got an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
But the love of skin is such a thing.
Had bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale nodules and acne.
In terms of food, I have tried everything with Christian's illness and have ended up surviving on a diet of sugar, milk and meat because nothing else works properly.
It can also be good that the hormone simply has a worm in there, but when one wants to have building sites everywhere like I do, one prefers not to look for anything that might go wrong.
I already have everything their colleague semina o. a.
written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was said in response to my question.
I had to keep working in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check when the money is there, I would have seen it

2022, a new 110kV underground cable will be built
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is now legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by network operator Bayernwerk.
The underground cable, measuring around seven kilometres in length, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a pylon in the region of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part with us so far.

The other three packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a nice start into the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it to you several times yesterday!
This is a wardrobe made of glass and all the sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is ruined.

Ref: Lesson planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues.
I have been a referee since the summer, and I enjoy teaching, but at the moment I have a big problem with efficiently planning my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped technically, so in principle I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as media.
In school I can only copy in black and white and for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I simply need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, at the moment we are dealing with the topic of geographic factors, and with me every hour is really different.
In principle, methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in preparation for simple lessons (which I need for UBs, etc.).
I always plan lessons based on the learning objectives (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build on that (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the working sheets too.
Maybe a geography teacher could show me how to work efficiently with the book.
Would really make me happy.
I would like to cancel the order #NUMBER# for #PRS_ORG#.
I have actually already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to return it as soon as possible.
Trade fears Christmas sales could be hit by 2G ruling
In most cases, only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed to enter.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and laments a drop in profits.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G rulings are damaging retail's important Christmas business.
HDE managing director, Stefan Genth, criticised the fact that sales were down for non-essential items.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off Christmas business.
What was actually the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit, said Genth.
According to this, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
It is only running in food retail and online.
The Association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
2G when shopping won't help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations are a deterrent to customers and require a high level of personal involvement.
He has called for the regulation to be introduced nationwide.
Afterwards, each customer must only be tested once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and will be issued with a band on that day giving them access to all premises.
In addition, in retail – as in local public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) – sample controls should be sufficient.
Property company Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also reported a difficult Christmas.
The frequencies are currently at 75 percent of the pre-coronavirus level without 2G, with turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall during the all-important Christmas trading period," managing director Wilhelm Wellner told "Wirtschaftswoche" newspaper.
Due to high personal and administrative expenses, attempts are being made to find solutions and have them approved for the centers.
This is to include what is known as the "band solution", where "visitors, for example, once prove their 2G connection at a central point in the centre once, and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all the shops without being disturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch, and there is also a fault in the frame, which has been attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it and taped it back up.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is constructed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD - LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities is used to set the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K and save it.
Take advantage of the current settings in the flash memory.
A particular feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The light produces a very high light flow with soft, high-quality light, completely free of flicker.
The 120-degree viewing angle at which you can illuminate large areas with a relatively small distance is excellent.
In any case, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness without changing the white balance.
It is a fantastic tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the light is mounted in inaccessible places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To run the individual settings stored in the memory locations, you simply hold down one of the memory buttons for longer.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the known situation stands – very practical when working in the studio, for example, when the camera is set to specific colour temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the DL3120's biggest strengths, with the possibility of using low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting whether the batteries have enough power – it has a built-in battery tester – for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in both display screens (the upper display for the left battery, the lower display for the right one).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlights continuously with power via the delivered charger.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm thread for tripod mounting, so you can attach it directly to your camera.
The inclination is set reliably by sensors on both sides.
Extreme attention was paid to the fact that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and, as a result, designed for longevity and hard use.
A pre-bent joint is also included in the delivery.
This is also great that a bag is included in the delivery.
So you can transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small :/
The "party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had lost their last two matches in series, were supposedly on the way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But SGE turned it around, shot to 5-2 within a good hour of overcoming initial frustration at a patchy start to the season. "It's crazy what these guys have achieved today," jubilant coach Oliver Glasner told DAZN, reserving "general praise for everyone who was there."
At first it looked as if it would be another disappointment for the Frankfurt team, who are now in ninth place and still not meeting expectations.
Patrik Schick put Leverkusen 2-0 up in front.
What happened next even impressed the SGE trainer.
The way the players have come back and shown a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am absolutely delighted with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to take to the field for the first time since the fourth match day and his muscle injury, emphasised the morale of his team mates.
I think our mentality was incredible," said the 27-year-old, smiling at the final score in particular for the fans.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner, however, wants to keep the focus for the upcoming tasks, and feels well-prepared in terms of the personal situation.
It is unusual that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in top physical condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live professionally.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and stay humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
In midweek, as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Monchengladbach (7.30pm, Sky).
I will receive the mail that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I have tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait for the money to be refunded and reorder?
That would mean for me unfortunately that I will not order again because it has taken such a long time.
Have they sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs yet?
Shock for German women's handball team ahead of quarter final against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with bowed heads and empty eyes after their drubbing by Denmark.
At the end of the main round of the World Championship, the German National team suffered a bitter defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now have to face the host country, Spain, in the quarter finals.
We were too nervous and had too much respect for our opponents, pronounced national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently towards Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished Group III in the main round with 8:2 points, taking second place behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't maintain the flow.
That was a bad game which we must erase from our memories," captain Emily Bölk said.
A significant step up is required if they are to make the semi-finals next Tuesday against the 2019 runners-up, to keep alive the fragile dream of a first medal since 2007.
Best German scorer in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was right-back Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were just not there - neither in attack, nor in defence, right-back Xenia Smits admitted, and called for: "We must now look forward quickly".
Not on top from start to finish
Unlike in the previous five matches, the German team did not start off well.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 lead after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on top form and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
The expected spark, however, was not forthcoming.
Against the aggressive Danish coverage, the German women had little impact - when they did get into the game, they usually failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Danish goal.
So, the match was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since right-back Mia Zschocke saw red a little later for a tough foul on her opponent.
However, she will be able to take part in the quarter finals.
It was only in the final stages of the first half that the DHB team got into the game, and they managed to score at least five goals by half-time.
Any faint hope of a comeback after the change was extinguished after just seven minutes, when it was 9:19.
Once again the Greens' young guns let themselves down in all areas and made it easy for their well-prepared opponents, who are among the medals at the end of the tournament.
As a result the German team could no longer raise their game and left the stage as clear losers.

The title proposes that I work as a vaccine specialist in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, above all, is administered in care homes.
As these will soon be finished to a large extent, it will in part move on to vaccine centres for me.
I am happy to answer time-unlimited questions on the organizational and human aspects as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does it interact with the vaccine...").
Within my remit falls the task of providing information about the vaccine, the indications for vaccination (i.e. people are entitled to a vaccination according to the Coronaimpfveorderung and have no grounds for refusal), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency treatment in the event of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, for example, medical assistants.
In Impfteams we often don't have any doctors there, but rather "only" (please no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out the injections themselves, so that I have to give most of the injections myself.
Serious "skin problem": Amberg white is the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, thought-provoking reflections have been caused by the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
But, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" this time remained unused by the callers.
No, it was not "a man who is nervous".
Nor anyone who "has to do everything quickly".
That, people heard the TV presenter say, is completely wrong.
This was the solution that the man from Amberg came up with and thus caused surprise among many Upper Palatinians.
The "Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a cloth that one uses to wipe the oven clean".
Dialect expert Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the better-known dialect word "Houdern".
In this way an educational gap was closed – certainly for a number of people who have lived in the Amberg region for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have reset the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Is choosing tyres for a racing bike really that safe?
This morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little bit in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I set off on my racing bike which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened, what awaits you in every town centre (this time: thanks, Krefeld!).
Glassplitter on the route.
Zack, his loud snoring and my back tyre not wanting to take part in any more of the race, meant that the rest of the course was out of the question.
As I had no chance of getting a replacement coat and hood on account of the day of the week, I had to turn back and take the first train home in a somewhat bad mood.
If the war doesn't go too badly, it might be better if I practice changing the tyre before the bike ride.
However, now I am faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would really like to avoid getting this problem often.
It's not so bad now, as the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who came to pick me up and ride 140km on the day I collected the bike) are also suboptimal, as he has been riding on them for many years.
However, if I think that I have to change a tire when driving at 80-90kms, then I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I am chatting to an older man by the platform, who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tyres, which are supposed to be puncture-proof.
The whole thing sounds very tempting now, of course.
But are they really that breakable?
I am not in the mood to spend €40/tyre now, only to be disappointed later.
Furthermore, I ask myself: at the moment I believe I weigh 25x622 on my racing bike.
That is (apparently) also the case with Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to go for other tyres with a racing bike?
The Swallow side seems to be my absolute! I would rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Car launches against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old drove his car onto the central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons, and then crossed over onto the wrong side of the road, according to police.
This resulted in a head-on collision with a vehicle driven by a 27-year-old.
The car belonging to the 53-year-old was then launched against a tree and the man trapped inside.
The 27-year-old driver and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

Following the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would once more be blessed with offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offshoot and it looks like the big boys with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this building proposal includes a designed-in footprint to lift the speaker into the correct position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be lengthened to suit the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume is of less importance, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker simply cannot generate such high sound pressure levels without filtering.
However, that does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
Instead, it is impressively mature and for its size, extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was given a slightly rising tone.
This is a common technique with broadband in order to optimise the bundling of the high frequencies.
Exactly on the listening place, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone range can be reduced slightly and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point-source sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The suspicion-arousing extremely low mechanical losses of B 100 - 6 OHM generate an enemy dynamics that is similar to it.
The SOLO 15 extends not only our SOLO series, but also expands its capabilities in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction projects, it is advisable to give some thought at the outset to the final appearance of the speaker, so that appropriate changes can be incorporated into the construction plans.
If, for example, the housing is to be veneered, the speaker must be correspondingly adjusted, as the veneer adds extra material.
Once all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. at a DIY store), you should first drill an 8mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate place, so that the cables can be passed through easily later.
With the help of a surface grinder, the speaker aperture in the front can now be implemented so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be mounted flush later.
Conversely, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel in order to create as large an opening area as possible for the speaker chassis inside.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM have an interruption in the phase, as is shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins the actual construction of the box by placing one of the side walls on a level surface in front of them.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the base are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be fitted and glued in place.
The stiffeners themselves can also vary in terms of their material thickness, depending on whether you want to use finished lengths from the DIY store or make your own from 16mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be applied.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. both sides and the front.
With the help of a suitable drill chuck or a forestner drill, the installation of the bass reflex vent and the plug socket on the back wall is facilitated.
A round-off saw is then used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top surface of the foot plate can also be rounded off in this way.
Next, the base plate is securely glued to the bottom of the housing and additionally screwed down with long wooden screws.
This involves marking and drilling (2.5mm drill-bit) the screw-in points of the loudspeaker chassis and the mounting clip.
After the casing of the vacuum cleaner has been cleaned (suction/blowing out), the cables are laid.
This is simplest achieved through the 35mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
In this case, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal opening, and is left to protrude there by around 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left hanging loose there.
The frequency hopping is prepared and used below.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch has been built-in and the termination screw has been tightened, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With the 35mm bASSREFLEX aperture and a bit of skill, you can apply hot glue to the aperture and thus seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small torch, it is possible to check the seal accordingly.
Now comes the damping, according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive speaker terminal (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to a length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the ear canal should be preserved.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello everyone.
Finally we can announce that we will also be hosting OSCAST this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, we will not be able to get more than four people into the studio, which means more planning and explains the short notice of the announcement.
ABER: At least three people will be on shift so that we can bring you the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans on the stream and hopefully thousands of you watching!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we're going to do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Pour some drinks, plan a good meal, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
